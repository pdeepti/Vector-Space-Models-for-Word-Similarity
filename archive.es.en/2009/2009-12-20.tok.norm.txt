program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

the government had initially blamed the deaths on meningitis . three jail officials in iran have been charged by a military court with the murder of three political prisoners detained during post-election street protests , the news agency isna reported on saturday . " some 12 officials at kahrizak detention center have been charged .
three of them have been charged with murder , " isna quoted a judiciary statement as saying .
" the date of their trial will be announced later , " the statement added .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected on june 12th amid accusations of vote fraud , which led to the worst unrest in the country since the islamic revolution three decades ago .
thousands of people were arrested and some were beaten following the government 's crackdown on street protestors .
the majority of them were brought to evin prison in northern tehran , but some 200 were reportedly taken to kahrizak in the south of the city .
kahrizak closes in july , iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei instructed officials to shut down kahrizak detention center for failing to meet hygiene and other standards required to uphold detainees ' rights .
initially authorities had blamed the detainee deaths on meningitis ; however , the coroner 's office came to a different conclusion .
" the coroner 's office rejected the claim that these people died of meningitis and confirmed there were bruises on their bodies from beatings and that the cause of their death was a series of beatings , " isna quoted the statement as saying .
most have been released , but more than 80 have been slapped with 15-year jail terms , and five with the death penalty .
according to the reformist opposition , more than 70 people were killed in post-election violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

"
she quickly admitted , however , that she would have preferred " more steps , " but that one should still refrain from " bad mouthing " the outcome .
merkel noted germany 's special responsibility in the next phase of diplomatic negotiations to combat global warming .
the chancellor stressed that her government would work to move the results forward when the next climate conference convenes in bonn , germany , in the middle of next year .
leaders try to put a positive spin on the outcome delegates to the summit , which ended saturday , admitted that only a bare-minimum agreement was reached that fell far short of the original goals .
although un secretary-general ban ki-moon also called the deal a " significant first step " , he regretted that " much was left to be done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protesters blame the failure on the us and china .
putting a brave , but almost cynical , face on the outcome , us president barack obama called the results " an important breakthrough " .
" for the first time in history , the world 's major economies came together to accept their responsibility to act in the face of climate change , " obama said .
admitting that the negotiations had been " extremely difficult " and " complex " , the us president said the copenhagen accord paved the way for international action in the coming years .
even the chinese , who many blame for blocking the negotiations , defended the outcome , saying the conference ended with " important and positive " results .
foreign minister yang jiechi said the conference was " not the goal , but rather a new beginning . "
german opposition and environmentalists outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this comic has big countries urging small ones to help germany 's opposition social democrat leader , sigmar gabriel , called the conference outcome a " mid-sized disaster " and said it was " a disgrace how world leaders were playing with the future of their children and grandchildren .

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

the government had initially blamed the deaths on meningitis . three jail officials in iran have been charged by a military court with the murder of three political prisoners detained during post-election street protests , the news agency isna reported on saturday . " some 12 officials at kahrizak detention center have been charged .
three of them have been charged with murder , " isna quoted a judiciary statement as saying .
" the date of their trial will be announced later , " the statement added .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected on june 12th amid accusations of vote fraud , which led to the worst unrest in the country since the islamic revolution three decades ago .
thousands of people were arrested and some were beaten following the government 's crackdown on street protestors .
the majority of them were brought to evin prison in northern tehran , but some 200 were reportedly taken to kahrizak in the south of the city .
kahrizak closes in july , iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei instructed officials to shut down kahrizak detention center for failing to meet hygiene and other standards required to uphold detainees ' rights .
initially authorities had blamed the detainee deaths on meningitis ; however , the coroner 's office came to a different conclusion .
" the coroner 's office rejected the claim that these people died of meningitis and confirmed there were bruises on their bodies from beatings and that the cause of their death was a series of beatings , " isna quoted the statement as saying .

the government had initially blamed the deaths on meningitis . three jail officials in iran have been charged by a military court with the murder of three political prisoners detained during post-election street protests , the news agency isna reported on saturday . " some 12 officials at kahrizak detention center have been charged .
three of them have been charged with murder , " isna quoted a judiciary statement as saying .
" the date of their trial will be announced later , " the statement added .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected on june 12th amid accusations of vote fraud , which led to the worst unrest in the country since the islamic revolution three decades ago .
thousands of people were arrested and some were beaten following the government 's crackdown on street protestors .
the majority of them were brought to evin prison in northern tehran , but some 200 were reportedly taken to kahrizak in the south of the city .
kahrizak closes in july , iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei instructed officials to shut down kahrizak detention center for failing to meet hygiene and other standards required to uphold detainees ' rights .
initially authorities had blamed the detainee deaths on meningitis ; however , the coroner 's office came to a different conclusion .
" the coroner 's office rejected the claim that these people died of meningitis and confirmed there were bruises on their bodies from beatings and that the cause of their death was a series of beatings , " isna quoted the statement as saying .
most have been released , but more than 80 have been slapped with 15-year jail terms , and five with the death penalty .
according to the reformist opposition , more than 70 people were killed in post-election violence .

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .

the government had initially blamed the deaths on meningitis . three jail officials in iran have been charged by a military court with the murder of three political prisoners detained during post-election street protests , the news agency isna reported on saturday . " some 12 officials at kahrizak detention center have been charged .
three of them have been charged with murder , " isna quoted a judiciary statement as saying .
" the date of their trial will be announced later , " the statement added .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected on june 12th amid accusations of vote fraud , which led to the worst unrest in the country since the islamic revolution three decades ago .
thousands of people were arrested and some were beaten following the government 's crackdown on street protestors .
the majority of them were brought to evin prison in northern tehran , but some 200 were reportedly taken to kahrizak in the south of the city .
kahrizak closes in july , iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei instructed officials to shut down kahrizak detention center for failing to meet hygiene and other standards required to uphold detainees ' rights .
initially authorities had blamed the detainee deaths on meningitis ; however , the coroner 's office came to a different conclusion .
" the coroner 's office rejected the claim that these people died of meningitis and confirmed there were bruises on their bodies from beatings and that the cause of their death was a series of beatings , " isna quoted the statement as saying .
most have been released , but more than 80 have been slapped with 15-year jail terms , and five with the death penalty .
according to the reformist opposition , more than 70 people were killed in post-election violence .

davutoglu said the visa waiver should be granted despite little progress being made with brussels on ankara 's eu membership aspirations .
" it 's unacceptable that certain balkan countries that are in the initial stages of the membership process and have not begun negotiations have been given the schengen privilege , while turkey , considering the level that turkish-eu relations have reached , has not , " davutoglu said at a news conference .
" we will follow this closely from now on , " he said , according to the state-run anatolian news agency .
citizens of the 25 signatory countries to the schengen agreement are allowed to cross into other schengen countries without a visa .
certain countries within the eu have not implemented the agreement in full , and travellers to those countries - bulgaria , cyprus , romania , liechtenstein , ireland and the uk - must still present a passport at the border .
davutoglu had previously criticized the eu plans to lift visa restrictions for serbia , montenegro and macedonia , while keeping them for bosnia-herzegovina and albania , two countries with muslim majorities .
" the way it 's being done by the eu is giving the wrong signals , " a turkish foreign ministry official said .
predominantly muslim turkey , a country of 71 million , has hit several roadblocks in its eu accession bid .
the eu has frozen several aspects of its talks with ankara as a result .
among the difficult issues are turkey 's failure to open its port and airports to ships and planes from eu member cyprus .

marcell jansen was the goalscorer in the 36th minute when he beat the charging bremen keeper tim wiese to the ball after being put through by a devastating pass from midfielder eljero elia .
an unlucky bremen hit woodwork three times in the match , and did manage a consolation goal in second-half injury time .
but the fight-back came too late , with the loss pushing the club back into sixth place heading into the winter break .

davutoglu said the visa waiver should be granted despite little progress being made with brussels on ankara 's eu membership aspirations .
" it 's unacceptable that certain balkan countries that are in the initial stages of the membership process and have not begun negotiations have been given the schengen privilege , while turkey , considering the level that turkish-eu relations have reached , has not , " davutoglu said at a news conference .
" we will follow this closely from now on , " he said , according to the state-run anatolian news agency .
citizens of the 25 signatory countries to the schengen agreement are allowed to cross into other schengen countries without a visa .
certain countries within the eu have not implemented the agreement in full , and travellers to those countries - bulgaria , cyprus , romania , liechtenstein , ireland and the uk - must still present a passport at the border .
davutoglu had previously criticized the eu plans to lift visa restrictions for serbia , montenegro and macedonia , while keeping them for bosnia-herzegovina and albania , two countries with muslim majorities .
" the way it 's being done by the eu is giving the wrong signals , " a turkish foreign ministry official said .
predominantly muslim turkey , a country of 71 million , has hit several roadblocks in its eu accession bid .
the eu has frozen several aspects of its talks with ankara as a result .
among the difficult issues are turkey 's failure to open its port and airports to ships and planes from eu member cyprus .
turkey 's relations with cyprus have long been strained , with turkey having a military presence in the internationally unrecognised independent north of the island. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government had initially blamed the deaths on meningitis . three jail officials in iran have been charged by a military court with the murder of three political prisoners detained during post-election street protests , the news agency isna reported on saturday . " some 12 officials at kahrizak detention center have been charged .
three of them have been charged with murder , " isna quoted a judiciary statement as saying .
" the date of their trial will be announced later , " the statement added .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected on june 12th amid accusations of vote fraud , which led to the worst unrest in the country since the islamic revolution three decades ago .
thousands of people were arrested and some were beaten following the government 's crackdown on street protestors .
the majority of them were brought to evin prison in northern tehran , but some 200 were reportedly taken to kahrizak in the south of the city .
kahrizak closes in july , iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei instructed officials to shut down kahrizak detention center for failing to meet hygiene and other standards required to uphold detainees ' rights .
initially authorities had blamed the detainee deaths on meningitis ; however , the coroner 's office came to a different conclusion .
" the coroner 's office rejected the claim that these people died of meningitis and confirmed there were bruises on their bodies from beatings and that the cause of their death was a series of beatings , " isna quoted the statement as saying .
most have been released , but more than 80 have been slapped with 15-year jail terms , and five with the death penalty .
according to the reformist opposition , more than 70 people were killed in post-election violence .
the official toll puts the number of demonstrator deaths at 30. vj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .
that again would mean " making a commitment before defining a strategy , " he said. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri was considered the spiritual father of the country 's reform movement . official iranian media reported that montazeri " passed away in his home last night . "
he was 87 .
state broadcasters said he had suffered from a number of ailments , including asthma and coronary problems .
right up until his death , montazeri had repeatedly accused iran 's ruling islamic establishment of imposing a dictatorship in the name of islam .
his criticisms made him a hero among the opposition , especially after the country 's disputed presidential elections last june .
his fierce criticism of president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's foreign and domestic policies and nuclear standoff with the west was particularly stinging because of his status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president was often the brunt of montazeri 's monitions not popular with the ruling establishment montazeri had once been designated to succeed supreme leader , ayatollah khomeini , the late founder of iran 's islamic republic in 1979 .
a falling-out with khomeini resulted in him being replaced by the current supreme cleric , ayatollah ali khamenei .
the official irna news agency said of montazeri that " he acted as the clerical figure of rioters in the post-election incidents and his unfounded statements were widely welcomed by anti-revolutionary media . "
montazeri 's death comes at a time of increasing tensions after pro-opposition students clashed with police earlier this month .
thousands of montazeri supporters were reported to be traveling to attend his funeral on monday in the shi 'ite holy city of qom. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the win pushes hamburg up to fourth place , while the three points were a gift from above for struggling cologne . hamburg has defeated werder bremen 2-1 at home to move up to fourth place , while cologne took down nuremberg 3-0 to propel them out of the relegation zone going into the league 's four-week winter break .
hamburg had to fight hard for the win after going a man down just after the half-hour mark when jerome boateng was shown a straight red for bringing down bremen dynamo marko marin on a breakaway .
at that point hamburg had already taken the lead when center back joris mathijsen , unmarked at the far post , latched onto a looping headed ball on nine minutes and struck with his own header .
marcell jansen was the goalscorer in the 36th minute when he beat the charging bremen keeper tim wiese to the ball after being put through by a devastating pass from midfielder eljero elia .
an unlucky bremen hit woodwork three times in the match , and did manage a consolation goal in second-half injury time .

" the coroner 's office rejected the claim that these people died of meningitis and confirmed there were bruises on their bodies from beatings and that the cause of their death was a series of beatings , " isna quoted the statement as saying .

the government had initially blamed the deaths on meningitis . three jail officials in iran have been charged by a military court with the murder of three political prisoners detained during post-election street protests , the news agency isna reported on saturday . " some 12 officials at kahrizak detention center have been charged .
three of them have been charged with murder , " isna quoted a judiciary statement as saying .
" the date of their trial will be announced later , " the statement added .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected on june 12th amid accusations of vote fraud , which led to the worst unrest in the country since the islamic revolution three decades ago .
thousands of people were arrested and some were beaten following the government 's crackdown on street protestors .
the majority of them were brought to evin prison in northern tehran , but some 200 were reportedly taken to kahrizak in the south of the city .
kahrizak closes in july , iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei instructed officials to shut down kahrizak detention center for failing to meet hygiene and other standards required to uphold detainees ' rights .
initially authorities had blamed the detainee deaths on meningitis ; however , the coroner 's office came to a different conclusion .
" the coroner 's office rejected the claim that these people died of meningitis and confirmed there were bruises on their bodies from beatings and that the cause of their death was a series of beatings , " isna quoted the statement as saying .
most have been released , but more than 80 have been slapped with 15-year jail terms , and five with the death penalty .

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .
that again would mean " making a commitment before defining a strategy , " he said. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .
that again would mean " making a commitment before defining a strategy , " he said. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official irna news agency said of montazeri that " he acted as the clerical figure of rioters in the post-election incidents and his unfounded statements were widely welcomed by anti-revolutionary media . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .

it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

the government had initially blamed the deaths on meningitis . three jail officials in iran have been charged by a military court with the murder of three political prisoners detained during post-election street protests , the news agency isna reported on saturday . " some 12 officials at kahrizak detention center have been charged .
three of them have been charged with murder , " isna quoted a judiciary statement as saying .
" the date of their trial will be announced later , " the statement added .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected on june 12th amid accusations of vote fraud , which led to the worst unrest in the country since the islamic revolution three decades ago .
thousands of people were arrested and some were beaten following the government 's crackdown on street protestors .
the majority of them were brought to evin prison in northern tehran , but some 200 were reportedly taken to kahrizak in the south of the city .
kahrizak closes in july , iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei instructed officials to shut down kahrizak detention center for failing to meet hygiene and other standards required to uphold detainees ' rights .
initially authorities had blamed the detainee deaths on meningitis ; however , the coroner 's office came to a different conclusion .
" the coroner 's office rejected the claim that these people died of meningitis and confirmed there were bruises on their bodies from beatings and that the cause of their death was a series of beatings , " isna quoted the statement as saying .
most have been released , but more than 80 have been slapped with 15-year jail terms , and five with the death penalty .
according to the reformist opposition , more than 70 people were killed in post-election violence .
the official toll puts the number of demonstrator deaths at 30. vj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .
that again would mean " making a commitment before defining a strategy , " he said. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

davutoglu said the visa waiver should be granted despite little progress being made with brussels on ankara 's eu membership aspirations .
" it 's unacceptable that certain balkan countries that are in the initial stages of the membership process and have not begun negotiations have been given the schengen privilege , while turkey , considering the level that turkish-eu relations have reached , has not , " davutoglu said at a news conference .
" we will follow this closely from now on , " he said , according to the state-run anatolian news agency .
citizens of the 25 signatory countries to the schengen agreement are allowed to cross into other schengen countries without a visa .
certain countries within the eu have not implemented the agreement in full , and travellers to those countries - bulgaria , cyprus , romania , liechtenstein , ireland and the uk - must still present a passport at the border .
davutoglu had previously criticized the eu plans to lift visa restrictions for serbia , montenegro and macedonia , while keeping them for bosnia-herzegovina and albania , two countries with muslim majorities .
" the way it 's being done by the eu is giving the wrong signals , " a turkish foreign ministry official said .
predominantly muslim turkey , a country of 71 million , has hit several roadblocks in its eu accession bid .
the eu has frozen several aspects of its talks with ankara as a result .

"
she quickly admitted , however , that she would have preferred " more steps , " but that one should still refrain from " bad mouthing " the outcome .
merkel noted germany 's special responsibility in the next phase of diplomatic negotiations to combat global warming .
the chancellor stressed that her government would work to move the results forward when the next climate conference convenes in bonn , germany , in the middle of next year .
leaders try to put a positive spin on the outcome delegates to the summit , which ended saturday , admitted that only a bare-minimum agreement was reached that fell far short of the original goals .

admitting that the negotiations had been " extremely difficult " and " complex " , the us president said the copenhagen accord paved the way for international action in the coming years .

green party chairwoman , claudia roth , called the outcome " a betrayal of the future for all the children on this planet " and urged the eu to convene an extraordinary summit to at least establish binding climate goals for its members .
the head of the german conservation society , olaf tschimpke , said copenhagen ended with a " rotten compromise . "
his counterpart at germany 's bund conservation group , hubert weiger , said the world was left " bitterly disappointed " and the anti-globalization network , attac , called the summit " a farce " and " historic for its failure . "
the climate conference ended with the promise to continue negotiating , but without a deadline , after 14 years of preliminary negotiations. gb / dpa / epd / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .

grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri was considered the spiritual father of the country 's reform movement . official iranian media reported that montazeri " passed away in his home last night . "
he was 87 .
state broadcasters said he had suffered from a number of ailments , including asthma and coronary problems .
right up until his death , montazeri had repeatedly accused iran 's ruling islamic establishment of imposing a dictatorship in the name of islam .
his criticisms made him a hero among the opposition , especially after the country 's disputed presidential elections last june .
his fierce criticism of president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's foreign and domestic policies and nuclear standoff with the west was particularly stinging because of his status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president was often the brunt of montazeri 's monitions not popular with the ruling establishment montazeri had once been designated to succeed supreme leader , ayatollah khomeini , the late founder of iran 's islamic republic in 1979 .
a falling-out with khomeini resulted in him being replaced by the current supreme cleric , ayatollah ali khamenei .
the official irna news agency said of montazeri that " he acted as the clerical figure of rioters in the post-election incidents and his unfounded statements were widely welcomed by anti-revolutionary media . "
montazeri 's death comes at a time of increasing tensions after pro-opposition students clashed with police earlier this month .
thousands of montazeri supporters were reported to be traveling to attend his funeral on monday in the shi 'ite holy city of qom. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

passengers expressed anger after being stranded for up to 16 hours . eurostar has cancelled all passenger service through the channel tunnel until monday as it investigates why four trains broke down , leaving thousands of passengers stranded overnight . the trains failed on friday evening as they moved from the freezing temperatures in northeastern france into the warmer air of the tunnel , operator eurostar said . the company also said it would run a series of tests in a bid to find out what happened .
more than 2,000 passengers were trapped beneath the english channel for up to 16 hours , on journeys from brussels or paris to london which should n't take more than 2 hours .
many said they were left without food or water , and complained that staff were unhelpful .
some others also suffered from claustrophobia or panic attacks . " we were without power .
we ran out of water , we ran out of food and there was very , very poor communication from the staff , " passenger lee godfrey told bbc radio .
" we lost air-conditioning when we lost the power .
we had to open the emergency doors ourselves . "
he added that people on the train had been " very , very panicky " . passenger backlash another passenger , patrick dussat , who was traveling from france to britain , also criticized eurostar 's reaction to the emergency .
" there have been heated arguments between eurostar staff and passengers who were fed up of being shut inside the trains .
on a human level , the management has been catastrophic , " he told afp by telephone .
a rescue locomotive and a shuttle train were brought in to usher passengers out of the 51-km -lrb- 32-mile -rrb- tunnel , the longest undersea tunnel in europe .
eurostar has issued an apology and said it would offer refunds , free travel vouchers and more as compensation .
" we 're very , very sorry that they 've had such a disrupted journey overnight , " richard brown , eurostar 's chief executive , told bbc tv .
" we 've been getting people home as quickly as we can but they have had very bad journeys . "
eurostar press officer paul gorman said the company hopes to start taking passengers through the tunnel on monday. vj / ap / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official irna news agency said of montazeri that " he acted as the clerical figure of rioters in the post-election incidents and his unfounded statements were widely welcomed by anti-revolutionary media . "

"
she quickly admitted , however , that she would have preferred " more steps , " but that one should still refrain from " bad mouthing " the outcome .
merkel noted germany 's special responsibility in the next phase of diplomatic negotiations to combat global warming .
the chancellor stressed that her government would work to move the results forward when the next climate conference convenes in bonn , germany , in the middle of next year .
leaders try to put a positive spin on the outcome delegates to the summit , which ended saturday , admitted that only a bare-minimum agreement was reached that fell far short of the original goals .
although un secretary-general ban ki-moon also called the deal a " significant first step " , he regretted that " much was left to be done . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protesters blame the failure on the us and china .
putting a brave , but almost cynical , face on the outcome , us president barack obama called the results " an important breakthrough " .
" for the first time in history , the world 's major economies came together to accept their responsibility to act in the face of climate change , " obama said .
admitting that the negotiations had been " extremely difficult " and " complex " , the us president said the copenhagen accord paved the way for international action in the coming years .
even the chinese , who many blame for blocking the negotiations , defended the outcome , saying the conference ended with " important and positive " results .
foreign minister yang jiechi said the conference was " not the goal , but rather a new beginning . "
german opposition and environmentalists outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this comic has big countries urging small ones to help germany 's opposition social democrat leader , sigmar gabriel , called the conference outcome a " mid-sized disaster " and said it was " a disgrace how world leaders were playing with the future of their children and grandchildren . "
he called on germany and the european union to " stick to their promise to reduce co ² emissions by 30 percent " by 2020 .
green party chairwoman , claudia roth , called the outcome " a betrayal of the future for all the children on this planet " and urged the eu to convene an extraordinary summit to at least establish binding climate goals for its members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .
that again would mean " making a commitment before defining a strategy , " he said. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

the win pushes hamburg up to fourth place , while the three points were a gift from above for struggling cologne . hamburg has defeated werder bremen 2-1 at home to move up to fourth place , while cologne took down nuremberg 3-0 to propel them out of the relegation zone going into the league 's four-week winter break .
hamburg had to fight hard for the win after going a man down just after the half-hour mark when jerome boateng was shown a straight red for bringing down bremen dynamo marko marin on a breakaway .

marcell jansen was the goalscorer in the 36th minute when he beat the charging bremen keeper tim wiese to the ball after being put through by a devastating pass from midfielder eljero elia .

the government had initially blamed the deaths on meningitis . three jail officials in iran have been charged by a military court with the murder of three political prisoners detained during post-election street protests , the news agency isna reported on saturday . " some 12 officials at kahrizak detention center have been charged .
three of them have been charged with murder , " isna quoted a judiciary statement as saying .
" the date of their trial will be announced later , " the statement added .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected on june 12th amid accusations of vote fraud , which led to the worst unrest in the country since the islamic revolution three decades ago .
thousands of people were arrested and some were beaten following the government 's crackdown on street protestors .
the majority of them were brought to evin prison in northern tehran , but some 200 were reportedly taken to kahrizak in the south of the city .
kahrizak closes in july , iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei instructed officials to shut down kahrizak detention center for failing to meet hygiene and other standards required to uphold detainees ' rights .
initially authorities had blamed the detainee deaths on meningitis ; however , the coroner 's office came to a different conclusion .
" the coroner 's office rejected the claim that these people died of meningitis and confirmed there were bruises on their bodies from beatings and that the cause of their death was a series of beatings , " isna quoted the statement as saying .
most have been released , but more than 80 have been slapped with 15-year jail terms , and five with the death penalty .
according to the reformist opposition , more than 70 people were killed in post-election violence .

" it 's unacceptable that certain balkan countries that are in the initial stages of the membership process and have not begun negotiations have been given the schengen privilege , while turkey , considering the level that turkish-eu relations have reached , has not , " davutoglu said at a news conference .

citizens of the 25 signatory countries to the schengen agreement are allowed to cross into other schengen countries without a visa .
certain countries within the eu have not implemented the agreement in full , and travellers to those countries - bulgaria , cyprus , romania , liechtenstein , ireland and the uk - must still present a passport at the border .
davutoglu had previously criticized the eu plans to lift visa restrictions for serbia , montenegro and macedonia , while keeping them for bosnia-herzegovina and albania , two countries with muslim majorities .

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .
that again would mean " making a commitment before defining a strategy , " he said. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .
that again would mean " making a commitment before defining a strategy , " he said. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

describing his definition of ' moderate ' taliban , guttenberg said " there were differences between the groups in afghanistan , with some , which radically oppose anything western and whose goal it is to fight our culture , and those which are simply immersed in their own , local culture . "
the defense minister said that he believed " cutting off every form of communication was no longer valid on the whole , although there must be criteria . "
" one does not have to follow obama " guttenberg again rejected demands by us president barack obama to boost germany 's troop contingent in afghanistan , saying " i would be careful with the words : one has to follow obama . "
" we should establish our own goal of forming a strategy that reflects our own experience , " he said .
nato and the white house have urged germany to provide at least an additional two battalions for northern afghanistan .
in a reference to the scheduled conference on afghanistan in london at the end of january , guttenberg said that " the first logical step of any new strategic approach is not to say we will send more troops and then figure out the strategy , but to formulate the strategy and then decide how many troops and civilians we will need . "
by the same token , guttenberg criticized opposition social democrat leader sigmar gabriel , who has rejected outright any boosting of german troop strength in afghanistan .
that again would mean " making a commitment before defining a strategy , " he said. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government had initially blamed the deaths on meningitis . three jail officials in iran have been charged by a military court with the murder of three political prisoners detained during post-election street protests , the news agency isna reported on saturday . " some 12 officials at kahrizak detention center have been charged .
three of them have been charged with murder , " isna quoted a judiciary statement as saying .
" the date of their trial will be announced later , " the statement added .
president mahmoud ahmadinejad was re-elected on june 12th amid accusations of vote fraud , which led to the worst unrest in the country since the islamic revolution three decades ago .
thousands of people were arrested and some were beaten following the government 's crackdown on street protestors .
the majority of them were brought to evin prison in northern tehran , but some 200 were reportedly taken to kahrizak in the south of the city .
kahrizak closes in july , iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei instructed officials to shut down kahrizak detention center for failing to meet hygiene and other standards required to uphold detainees ' rights .
initially authorities had blamed the detainee deaths on meningitis ; however , the coroner 's office came to a different conclusion .
" the coroner 's office rejected the claim that these people died of meningitis and confirmed there were bruises on their bodies from beatings and that the cause of their death was a series of beatings , " isna quoted the statement as saying .
most have been released , but more than 80 have been slapped with 15-year jail terms , and five with the death penalty .
according to the reformist opposition , more than 70 people were killed in post-election violence .

it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 20.12.2009 saudis fail to halt terrorism funding despite minor gains großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia has been accused of funding al qaeda terrorists eight years after the 9/11 attacks on new york , us and european officials say saudi efforts to stop the flow of funds from saudi charities and individuals to terrorist groups have improved but failed to halt it . for the first 18 months after the september 11 attacks , us officials charged that saudi arabia , shell-shocked by the fact that a majority of the perpetrators had been saudi nationals , was dragging its feet on implementing measures to prevent saudis from funding militant islamic groups like al qaeda .
it took a series of al qaeda attacks on saudi targets in 2003 and 2004 to persuade the kingdom to pay more than lip service to the need to halt funding of terrorist groups .
us and european officials acknowledge that the saudi government has introduced strict monitoring of bank transactions and banned the transfer abroad of charitable funds without government approval .
they also note that some 100 suspected terrorism financiers have been arrested in the kingdom over the past two years , approximately 20 of which were prosecuted .
most recently , saudi authorities said that they had arrested a charity official for directing funds to extremists .
the praise for the saudi efforts by us treasury secretary tim geithner during a july visit to saudi arabia constitute a significant departure from us treasury statements since september 11 , which tended to assert that saudi measures to halt the flow of funding of terrorist groups did not go far enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to halt the funding of al qaeda have had some success us assistant secretary for terrorist financing david cohen last month , highlighting saudi successes , described al qaeda as a cash-strapped organization that was finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds .
in recognition of its efforts , saudi arabia was recently admitted to the egmont group , the international network of financial intelligence units . saudi arabia , a key ally guido steinberg , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , says the post 9/11 perception of saudi arabia as a funder and promoter of terrorism has been replaced by one in which the kingdom " for western politics and public opinion is an irreplaceable ally and a leading power in an anti-iranian alliance of moderate arab governments and nations . "
in a study published earlier this year , steinberg questions european and german policy of viewing saudi arabia as primarily an american sphere of interest .
" given the importance of the middle east for the federal republic -lrb- of germany -rrb- and the european union , the question arises if saudi arabia could not become an important partner in german and european policy , " steinberg writes .
arguing that saudi policies toward various middle eastern trouble spots - iran , palestine , iraq and lebanon - coincide with those of germany and the eu , steinberg concludes : " the thought of closer collaboration with saudi arabia looms large if germany wants to expand its ability to maneuver in the middle east . "
if the will to fight terrorism funding was at the core of us and european criticism in the years following the september 11 attacks , the issue today for western law enforcement is implementation and effectiveness of saudi efforts to close the terrorism money tap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sections of saudi society still support al qaeda and other militant groups a us government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- report concludes that " saudi individuals and saudi-based charitable organizations continue to be a significant source of financing for terrorism and extremism outside of saudi arabia . "
it quotes us treasury officials as saying that " saudi-based individuals are a top source of funding for al qaeda and associated groups , such as the taliban . "
the report says saudi individuals and charities circumvent saudi restrictions by employing couriers to transfer cash to militant organizations .
" while the saudi government is now more focused on terrorist financing , the scale and volume make it an uphill battle .
in saudi arabia 's conservative society , some support for al-qaeda - and undoubtedly more support for hamas - still exists , " michael jacobson , of the washington institute for near east policy and a former advisor in the us treasury 's office of terrorism , told deutsche welle .
" furthermore , because saudi arabia remains a wealthy , cash-based society where carrying or transferring large sums of money is not unusual , it is far more difficult for governments to trace and detect illicit transactions , " jacobson said .
taliban and pakistani groups benefit us president obama 's special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan has in recent months repeatedly complained that saudi funding may be as important to the taliban as drug revenues as a source of income .
" in the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in afghanistan .
that is simply not true … -lsb- the taliban -rsb- get a lot more money out of the gulf , according to our intelligence sources , " holbrooke recently told a news conference in the pakistani capital islamabad .
a recent pakistani police report accused saudi arabia 's al haramain foundation of donating $ 15 million -lrb- 10 million euros -rrb- to militants responsible for suicide bombings in pakistan and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
the us and saudi arabia jointly as well as the united nations have designated in recent years several foreign branches of al haramain as terrorist organizations .
however , al haramain continues to operate legally in saudi arabia although the us treasury last year put the foundation as a whole , including its saudi headquarters , on its list of designated terrorist organizations .
similarly , indian officials say lashkar e tayiba , the pakistani group responsible for last year 's attacks in mumbai , continues to operate in saudi arabia .
indian police recently arrested lashkar leader muhammad omar madni shortly after he had visited the kingdom on a fundraising trip .
indian police said they had also recently found a large amount of saudi riyals during a raid on a lashkar safe house in mumbai .
flaws in the saudi ability to halt the flow of funds to militant groups is part of an emerging perception that the kingdom 's ability to leverage its status as the world 's major oil producer and the administrator of islam 's most holy sites to influence middle eastern events has diminished as countries like iran and syria and groups like hizbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza chart their own course .
" beyond riyadh 's preoccupation with iran , the broader currents of change sweeping over the middle east are challenging saudi foreign policies as well … the growing role of non-state actors , militias and ethnic breakaway movements , has exposed the limitations of riyadh 's reliance on petro-dollars to simply buy off whole governments , " webster brooks , a foreign policy fellow at the university of denver 's center for new policy and politics , told deutsche welle .

davutoglu said the visa waiver should be granted despite little progress being made with brussels on ankara 's eu membership aspirations .
" it 's unacceptable that certain balkan countries that are in the initial stages of the membership process and have not begun negotiations have been given the schengen privilege , while turkey , considering the level that turkish-eu relations have reached , has not , " davutoglu said at a news conference .

grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri was considered the spiritual father of the country 's reform movement . official iranian media reported that montazeri " passed away in his home last night . "
he was 87 .
state broadcasters said he had suffered from a number of ailments , including asthma and coronary problems .
right up until his death , montazeri had repeatedly accused iran 's ruling islamic establishment of imposing a dictatorship in the name of islam .
his criticisms made him a hero among the opposition , especially after the country 's disputed presidential elections last june .
his fierce criticism of president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's foreign and domestic policies and nuclear standoff with the west was particularly stinging because of his status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president was often the brunt of montazeri 's monitions not popular with the ruling establishment montazeri had once been designated to succeed supreme leader , ayatollah khomeini , the late founder of iran 's islamic republic in 1979 .
a falling-out with khomeini resulted in him being replaced by the current supreme cleric , ayatollah ali khamenei .
the official irna news agency said of montazeri that " he acted as the clerical figure of rioters in the post-election incidents and his unfounded statements were widely welcomed by anti-revolutionary media . "
montazeri 's death comes at a time of increasing tensions after pro-opposition students clashed with police earlier this month .
thousands of montazeri supporters were reported to be traveling to attend his funeral on monday in the shi 'ite holy city of qom. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

davutoglu said the visa waiver should be granted despite little progress being made with brussels on ankara 's eu membership aspirations .
" it 's unacceptable that certain balkan countries that are in the initial stages of the membership process and have not begun negotiations have been given the schengen privilege , while turkey , considering the level that turkish-eu relations have reached , has not , " davutoglu said at a news conference .

certain countries within the eu have not implemented the agreement in full , and travellers to those countries - bulgaria , cyprus , romania , liechtenstein , ireland and the uk - must still present a passport at the border .
davutoglu had previously criticized the eu plans to lift visa restrictions for serbia , montenegro and macedonia , while keeping them for bosnia-herzegovina and albania , two countries with muslim majorities .

grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri was considered the spiritual father of the country 's reform movement . official iranian media reported that montazeri " passed away in his home last night . "
he was 87 .
state broadcasters said he had suffered from a number of ailments , including asthma and coronary problems .
right up until his death , montazeri had repeatedly accused iran 's ruling islamic establishment of imposing a dictatorship in the name of islam .
his criticisms made him a hero among the opposition , especially after the country 's disputed presidential elections last june .
his fierce criticism of president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's foreign and domestic policies and nuclear standoff with the west was particularly stinging because of his status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president was often the brunt of montazeri 's monitions not popular with the ruling establishment montazeri had once been designated to succeed supreme leader , ayatollah khomeini , the late founder of iran 's islamic republic in 1979 .
a falling-out with khomeini resulted in him being replaced by the current supreme cleric , ayatollah ali khamenei .
the official irna news agency said of montazeri that " he acted as the clerical figure of rioters in the post-election incidents and his unfounded statements were widely welcomed by anti-revolutionary media . "
montazeri 's death comes at a time of increasing tensions after pro-opposition students clashed with police earlier this month .
thousands of montazeri supporters were reported to be traveling to attend his funeral on monday in the shi 'ite holy city of qom. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
