program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.03.2009 eu papers over cracks amid fears of economic iron curtain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't worry , be happy : the eu has everything under control - or so it says judging from the comments by eu leaders after less than four hours of talks in brussels sunday , it would appear that all is well within the 27-member bloc .
but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .

but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .
reading the fine print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top opel and gm executives have been presenting their restructuring plans the economics minister said the company 's restructuring plan first had to be examined in detail .
" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm echoed guttenberg 's sentiments .
he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .

"
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .
reading the fine print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top opel and gm executives have been presenting their restructuring plans the economics minister said the company 's restructuring plan first had to be examined in detail .
" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm echoed guttenberg 's sentiments .
he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .
wilhelm said the company 's business plan would first be checked by independent financial auditors to determine its sustainability .
cautious approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an onerous task for germany 's new finance minister guttenberg has been careful to avoid premature promises , telling germany 's ard television ahead of the meeting that the german government would conduct a " very far-reaching examination " of the company 's proposals to ensure that opel has " a truly viable perspective for the future . "
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .
a portion of the government bailout is likely to come from the state budgets .
some 25,000 people in germany are employed by opel . dfm / jg / kjb / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.03.2009 eu papers over cracks amid fears of economic iron curtain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't worry , be happy : the eu has everything under control - or so it says judging from the comments by eu leaders after less than four hours of talks in brussels sunday , it would appear that all is well within the 27-member bloc .
but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "
the specter of a new iron curtain was raised at the start of the talks by hungary 's premier ferenc gyurcsany . " in the beginning of the 1990s , we reunified europe .
now the challenge is to reunify europe financially : we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe „ said gyurcsany , whose cash-strapped country has required an international bail-out .
in their joint statement , leaders agreed to allay such concerns by acknowledging " clear differences between the member states in central and eastern europe " , rather than along an east-west divide .
while poland and slovakia are in sound financial shape , expecting modest economic growth this year , hungary and latvia have already been forced to look for rescue from international institutions . leaders reject talk of divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's heavy hitters rejected talk of a split in the bloc sunday 's summit was called by the czech presidency in a bid to shore up unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that it may risk breaking into splinter groups .
topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .
and hungarian calls for the creation of a 190-billion-euro -lrb- $ 240-billion -rrb- crisis fund for the whole region were dismissed by the eu 's richest nation , with german chancellor angela merkel saying : " the situation is very different .
we can not compare slovakia or slovenia with hungary . "
as philip white , senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform put it : " leaders are acutely aware of the parlous economic background , so they will bend over backwards to come out with soothing statements .
" the real problem is that a lot of leaders will be unable to live up to their rhetorical commitments , " white predicted . nda / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hungary , poland and czech republic are among several states awaiting erm ii status .
estonia , lithuania and latvia , meanwhile , have been erm ii participants for a number of years but have so far been barred from taking up the euro .

the donors also called for an immediate lifting of israel 's blockade of the battered coastal strip preventing all but vital aid from entering the area .
gaza has an estimated 1.4 million inhabitants .
" the status quo is of benefit to all the extremism .
it is time for us to speed up the agenda , " french president nicolas sarkozy told the conference at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
final figures from the conference show the eu has pledged $ 554 million , the us $ 900 million and gulf arab states $ 1.65 billion in aid for the palestinians .
germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas had asked for some $ 2.8 billion , almost half of that to pay for the reconstruction of the gaza strip after israel 's offensive in late december and january .
" we are confronted with a serious dilemma , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told a final news conference .
" will we once again reconstruct something we built a few years ago and now has been hammered and flattened ?
" many donors , despite pledges , will wish to see political progress before they commit to infrastructure reconstruction , " he said .
norway and egypt jointly presided over the conference .
gaza remains sealed off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between egypt and gaza also remains closed but the united nations and aid agencies have said that rebuilding the coastal enclave would be extremely difficult as long as border crossings into gaza remain closed . " the situation at the border crossings is intolerable .
aid workers do not have access .
essential commodities can not get in , " un secretary-general ban ki-moon told donors at the conference .
" our first and indispensable goal , therefore , is to open crossings .
by the same token , however , it is therefore essential to ensure that illegal weapons do not enter gaza . "
" money is very important but it is not going to solve the problem unless there is pressure from the international community on israel to open all -lrb- border -rrb- crossings with gaza " said gasser abdel-razek , a spokesman for human rights group oxfam international .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.03.2009 world pledges billions for gaza reconstruction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 22-day offensive destroyed many homes and government buildings in gaza the eu , us and arab states have pledged close to $ 4.5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billion euros -rrb- to help rebuild the war-torn gaza strip and reform the palestinian authority . but as donors met in egypt on monday , march 2 , they emphasized that financial aid must not fall into the hands of hamas , the islamist group which rules gaza .
the donors also called for an immediate lifting of israel 's blockade of the battered coastal strip preventing all but vital aid from entering the area .
gaza has an estimated 1.4 million inhabitants .
" the status quo is of benefit to all the extremism .
it is time for us to speed up the agenda , " french president nicolas sarkozy told the conference at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
final figures from the conference show the eu has pledged $ 554 million , the us $ 900 million and gulf arab states $ 1.65 billion in aid for the palestinians .
germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas had asked for some $ 2.8 billion , almost half of that to pay for the reconstruction of the gaza strip after israel 's offensive in late december and january .
" we are confronted with a serious dilemma , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told a final news conference .
" will we once again reconstruct something we built a few years ago and now has been hammered and flattened ?
" many donors , despite pledges , will wish to see political progress before they commit to infrastructure reconstruction , " he said .
norway and egypt jointly presided over the conference .
gaza remains sealed off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between egypt and gaza also remains closed but the united nations and aid agencies have said that rebuilding the coastal enclave would be extremely difficult as long as border crossings into gaza remain closed . " the situation at the border crossings is intolerable .
aid workers do not have access .
essential commodities can not get in , " un secretary-general ban ki-moon told donors at the conference .
" our first and indispensable goal , therefore , is to open crossings .
by the same token , however , it is therefore essential to ensure that illegal weapons do not enter gaza . "
" money is very important but it is not going to solve the problem unless there is pressure from the international community on israel to open all -lrb- border -rrb- crossings with gaza " said gasser abdel-razek , a spokesman for human rights group oxfam international .
french president nicolas sarkozy called on israel to open the border crossings and allow goods through .
" gaza should not actually be a prison with open skies , " he told the conference .
money will not end up " in the wrong hands " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donors do not want hamas to receive the cash donors have balked at giving aid to hamas , which has controlled the strip since 2007 .
in response , leaders of hamas and abbas 's rival fatah faction agreed to work towards forming a " national unity " government on thursday , feb .
26 , and to hold fresh elections soon . us secretary of state hillary clinton , who was making her first appearance at such a large-scale conference in her new role , reassured delegates on monday that the us was working with the palestinian authority to install " safeguards " to ensure that funding " is only used where and for whom it is intended " and " does not end up in the wrong hands . "
she also stressed that the response to the current gaza crisis " can not be separated " from broader peace efforts , adding that aid to gaza could " foster conditions in which a palestinian state can be fully realized . "
neither israel nor hamas were present at the conference .
israel said it supported efforts to help palestinians in the strip , but wanted assurances the aid money would not reach hamas militants .
" we definitely do n't want to see the goodwill of the international community exploited by hamas and serve hamas ' extremist purposes , " said mark regev , a spokesman for prime minister ehud olmert .
more than 1,300 palestinians were killed and thousands of gaza homes and government buildings were reduced to rubble during the israeli offensive .

the donors also called for an immediate lifting of israel 's blockade of the battered coastal strip preventing all but vital aid from entering the area .
gaza has an estimated 1.4 million inhabitants .
" the status quo is of benefit to all the extremism .
it is time for us to speed up the agenda , " french president nicolas sarkozy told the conference at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
final figures from the conference show the eu has pledged $ 554 million , the us $ 900 million and gulf arab states $ 1.65 billion in aid for the palestinians .
germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas had asked for some $ 2.8 billion , almost half of that to pay for the reconstruction of the gaza strip after israel 's offensive in late december and january .
" we are confronted with a serious dilemma , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told a final news conference .
" will we once again reconstruct something we built a few years ago and now has been hammered and flattened ?
" many donors , despite pledges , will wish to see political progress before they commit to infrastructure reconstruction , " he said .
norway and egypt jointly presided over the conference .
gaza remains sealed off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between egypt and gaza also remains closed but the united nations and aid agencies have said that rebuilding the coastal enclave would be extremely difficult as long as border crossings into gaza remain closed . " the situation at the border crossings is intolerable .
aid workers do not have access .
essential commodities can not get in , " un secretary-general ban ki-moon told donors at the conference .
" our first and indispensable goal , therefore , is to open crossings .
by the same token , however , it is therefore essential to ensure that illegal weapons do not enter gaza . "
" money is very important but it is not going to solve the problem unless there is pressure from the international community on israel to open all -lrb- border -rrb- crossings with gaza " said gasser abdel-razek , a spokesman for human rights group oxfam international .
french president nicolas sarkozy called on israel to open the border crossings and allow goods through .
" gaza should not actually be a prison with open skies , " he told the conference .
money will not end up " in the wrong hands " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donors do not want hamas to receive the cash donors have balked at giving aid to hamas , which has controlled the strip since 2007 .
in response , leaders of hamas and abbas 's rival fatah faction agreed to work towards forming a " national unity " government on thursday , feb .
26 , and to hold fresh elections soon . us secretary of state hillary clinton , who was making her first appearance at such a large-scale conference in her new role , reassured delegates on monday that the us was working with the palestinian authority to install " safeguards " to ensure that funding " is only used where and for whom it is intended " and " does not end up in the wrong hands . "
she also stressed that the response to the current gaza crisis " can not be separated " from broader peace efforts , adding that aid to gaza could " foster conditions in which a palestinian state can be fully realized . "
neither israel nor hamas were present at the conference .
israel said it supported efforts to help palestinians in the strip , but wanted assurances the aid money would not reach hamas militants .
" we definitely do n't want to see the goodwill of the international community exploited by hamas and serve hamas ' extremist purposes , " said mark regev , a spokesman for prime minister ehud olmert .
more than 1,300 palestinians were killed and thousands of gaza homes and government buildings were reduced to rubble during the israeli offensive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2009 austria , hungary allowed to keep ban on genetically modified crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria and hungary have maintained their right to ban gm crops , for now germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , has voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize . eu environment ministers meeting in brussels on monday , march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow us biotech giant monsanto 's mon810 gm maize grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .
eu sources say that around 100 billion euros of that will need to be spent in developing countries . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .

it has taught us one thing .
political principles that seemed unshakeable just a few weeks ago no longer apply .
and no one can predict with certainty what action will be needed to avert catastrophe in the weeks ahead .
the explicit " no " to a rescue plan for the ailing economies of eastern europe may also not stand the test of time .
german chancellor angela merkel and czech prime minster mirek topolanek whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , are currently resisting calls for eu cash injections for hungary , latvia , romania , bulgaria et al .

or could some eu states really be at risk of bankruptcy in the near future because they can not afford private sector loans ?
as recently as december , many eastern european governments were maintaining that they had not been hit by the financial crisis .

there are already signs that the financial crisis could also endanger the euro , which is used by 16 eu states .

germany , one of the biggest and strongest eu economies , balks at having to step in and prop up other member states because it would mean that it would also have to increase the interest rates on its own government bonds to attract buyers .
eu leaders did not come up with any answers to these particular questions at their hastily convened summit meetings .
however , state representatives were at least united in speaking out against protectionism .
they were adamant that the single market must continue to function and that no countries should go it alone .
that is a good thing .
in the current financial situation any seizing up of the internal market would quickly lead the eu into rack and ruin .
eu members also agree that there is a need to tighten regulation and oversight for banks .
they intend to co-ordinate the states ' rescue plans and economic stimulus programs .
the bloc is also making progress on the issue of how to deal with the problem of the worthless - so-called toxic - assets held by european banks .
eu members have reached a consensus on the need to establish common standards .
they also agree that state debt , despite the burden of expensive stimulus programs , should not be allowed to spiral out of control .
this degree of unity would have been unthinkable just a few months ago . the europeans are being bounced into taking action by the force of events .

it was also seen as a boost for zapatero , whose support had suffered as a result of the country 's deepening recession . analysts had attributed the socialist party 's rise in popularity ahead of the vote to zapatero 's pledge to negotiate peace with the violent separatist group eta . however , an alliance between the socialists and the pp was expected to cost zapatero 's minority government the support of the pnv in the national parliament , which would force him to find new partners . a coalition between the socialists and pnv is also plausible , but unlikely , as lopez has clashed with ibarretxe over the latter 's pet project of holding self-determination referendums . a hefty blow to basque separatists spanish daily el mundo called the election result the opening of a " new era " for the troubled northern region of 2.1 million residents and a " great setback " for ibarretxe . granted regional autonomy in 1979 , the basque region has been governed by the pnv ever since . there would be " no more room in the basque parliament for sovereignty plans or ... complicity with terrorism , " commented the daily el pais . eta , which has been responsible for more than 820 deaths since 1968 , is not officially supported by any of the basque political parties .
but critics of basque nationalism have long accused nationalist politicians of being in cahoots with the terrorist group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the vote , the basque region is distancing itself from the militant separatist group eta last month , spain 's supreme court had banned two nationalist basque parties from participating in sunday 's election due to their ties to batasuna , the outlawed political wing of eta . conservatives regain power in galicia elections were also held in the north-western galicia region , where the pp was expected to form a government after getting an absolute majority . the conservatives will thus restore their traditional domination in galicia , after four years of rule by a coalition of socialists and galician nationalists . the galician result was seen as a blow to zapatero and as a boost to pp leader mariano rajoy , whose leadership had been questioned after two successive national election defeats and over corruption allegations affecting his party . kjb / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has taught us one thing .
political principles that seemed unshakeable just a few weeks ago no longer apply .
and no one can predict with certainty what action will be needed to avert catastrophe in the weeks ahead .
the explicit " no " to a rescue plan for the ailing economies of eastern europe may also not stand the test of time .
german chancellor angela merkel and czech prime minster mirek topolanek whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , are currently resisting calls for eu cash injections for hungary , latvia , romania , bulgaria et al .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's bernd riegert but is the hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany exaggerating when he says that eu member states in eastern europe need a support fund of up to 190 billion euros to restore solvency ?
or could some eu states really be at risk of bankruptcy in the near future because they can not afford private sector loans ?
as recently as december , many eastern european governments were maintaining that they had not been hit by the financial crisis .
now , they are standing at the edge of the abyss . and things continue to develop apace .
there are already signs that the financial crisis could also endanger the euro , which is used by 16 eu states .
the euro is already feeling the pinch on the currency markets .
eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquín almunia has warned about the danger of the flight of capital .
ireland , greece , spain and italy are finding it increasingly difficult to find buyers for their government bonds .
germany , one of the biggest and strongest eu economies , balks at having to step in and prop up other member states because it would mean that it would also have to increase the interest rates on its own government bonds to attract buyers .
eu leaders did not come up with any answers to these particular questions at their hastily convened summit meetings .
however , state representatives were at least united in speaking out against protectionism .
they were adamant that the single market must continue to function and that no countries should go it alone .
that is a good thing .
in the current financial situation any seizing up of the internal market would quickly lead the eu into rack and ruin .
eu members also agree that there is a need to tighten regulation and oversight for banks .
they intend to co-ordinate the states ' rescue plans and economic stimulus programs .
the bloc is also making progress on the issue of how to deal with the problem of the worthless - so-called toxic - assets held by european banks .
eu members have reached a consensus on the need to establish common standards .
they also agree that state debt , despite the burden of expensive stimulus programs , should not be allowed to spiral out of control .
this degree of unity would have been unthinkable just a few months ago . the europeans are being bounced into taking action by the force of events .
but the europeans must now make sure that they act resolutely at the summit of the world 's 20 most important economic powers on 2 april in london .
some of the problems being faced elsewhere put the difficulties faced by some european states into perspective , and threaten to overshadow them .
europe has to ensure that it remains competitive .
the impromptu summit in brussels has shown that the small eu member states are not prepared to be left out .
the meeting was a retort in kinds to last week 's meeting in berlin ahead of the g20 summit where only the major eu states .
but now is not the time for internal squabbling .
this crisis is far too serious for that . bernd riegert / jg / nda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu papers over cracks amid fears of economic iron curtain judging from the comments by eu leaders after less than four hours of talks in brussels sunday , it would appear that all is well within the 27-member bloc .
but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain .
-lrb- 02.03.2009 -rrb- eastern european nations fear rift with richer neighbors eu leaders tried to overcome their differences on how to address the ongoing economic crisis , but protectionism fears and unheeded calls for aid from smaller members raised fears of a " new iron curtain " in europe .
-lrb- 01.03.2009 -rrb- new eu members should be treated equally , says polish minister european union veterans should treat newly-entered members from central and eastern europe as equals , and give them the same chance to join the euro as old members , poland 's minister for europe said on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.03.2009 eu papers over cracks amid fears of economic iron curtain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't worry , be happy : the eu has everything under control - or so it says judging from the comments by eu leaders after less than four hours of talks in brussels sunday , it would appear that all is well within the 27-member bloc .
but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "
the specter of a new iron curtain was raised at the start of the talks by hungary 's premier ferenc gyurcsany . " in the beginning of the 1990s , we reunified europe .
now the challenge is to reunify europe financially : we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe „ said gyurcsany , whose cash-strapped country has required an international bail-out .
in their joint statement , leaders agreed to allay such concerns by acknowledging " clear differences between the member states in central and eastern europe " , rather than along an east-west divide .
while poland and slovakia are in sound financial shape , expecting modest economic growth this year , hungary and latvia have already been forced to look for rescue from international institutions . leaders reject talk of divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's heavy hitters rejected talk of a split in the bloc sunday 's summit was called by the czech presidency in a bid to shore up unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that it may risk breaking into splinter groups .
topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .
and hungarian calls for the creation of a 190-billion-euro -lrb- $ 240-billion -rrb- crisis fund for the whole region were dismissed by the eu 's richest nation , with german chancellor angela merkel saying : " the situation is very different .
we can not compare slovakia or slovenia with hungary . "
as philip white , senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform put it : " leaders are acutely aware of the parlous economic background , so they will bend over backwards to come out with soothing statements .
" the real problem is that a lot of leaders will be unable to live up to their rhetorical commitments , " white predicted . nda / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "
the specter of a new iron curtain was raised at the start of the talks by hungary 's premier ferenc gyurcsany . " in the beginning of the 1990s , we reunified europe .
now the challenge is to reunify europe financially : we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe „ said gyurcsany , whose cash-strapped country has required an international bail-out .
in their joint statement , leaders agreed to allay such concerns by acknowledging " clear differences between the member states in central and eastern europe " , rather than along an east-west divide .
while poland and slovakia are in sound financial shape , expecting modest economic growth this year , hungary and latvia have already been forced to look for rescue from international institutions . leaders reject talk of divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's heavy hitters rejected talk of a split in the bloc sunday 's summit was called by the czech presidency in a bid to shore up unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that it may risk breaking into splinter groups .
topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .
and hungarian calls for the creation of a 190-billion-euro -lrb- $ 240-billion -rrb- crisis fund for the whole region were dismissed by the eu 's richest nation , with german chancellor angela merkel saying : " the situation is very different .
we can not compare slovakia or slovenia with hungary . "
as philip white , senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform put it : " leaders are acutely aware of the parlous economic background , so they will bend over backwards to come out with soothing statements .
" the real problem is that a lot of leaders will be unable to live up to their rhetorical commitments , " white predicted . nda / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .

but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "
the specter of a new iron curtain was raised at the start of the talks by hungary 's premier ferenc gyurcsany . " in the beginning of the 1990s , we reunified europe .
now the challenge is to reunify europe financially : we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe „ said gyurcsany , whose cash-strapped country has required an international bail-out .
in their joint statement , leaders agreed to allay such concerns by acknowledging " clear differences between the member states in central and eastern europe " , rather than along an east-west divide .
while poland and slovakia are in sound financial shape , expecting modest economic growth this year , hungary and latvia have already been forced to look for rescue from international institutions . leaders reject talk of divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's heavy hitters rejected talk of a split in the bloc sunday 's summit was called by the czech presidency in a bid to shore up unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that it may risk breaking into splinter groups .
topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .
and hungarian calls for the creation of a 190-billion-euro -lrb- $ 240-billion -rrb- crisis fund for the whole region were dismissed by the eu 's richest nation , with german chancellor angela merkel saying : " the situation is very different .
we can not compare slovakia or slovenia with hungary . "
as philip white , senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform put it : " leaders are acutely aware of the parlous economic background , so they will bend over backwards to come out with soothing statements .
" the real problem is that a lot of leaders will be unable to live up to their rhetorical commitments , " white predicted . nda / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel said after an eu summit in brussels on sunday , march 1 , that the bloc " could consider " shortening the minimum two-year preparatory phase for euro membership .
" there are requests to join erm ii faster , " merkel said .
" we can have a look at that . "
the exchange rate mechanism ii currency grid , or erm ii , is an agreement to maintain stable exchange rates between the euro and the currency of the euro zone applicant state to avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations on the internal market .
euro candidates are expected to participate in erm ii for at least two years before adopting the euro .
hungary , poland and czech republic are among several states awaiting erm ii status .
estonia , lithuania and latvia , meanwhile , have been erm ii participants for a number of years but have so far been barred from taking up the euro .
french president nicolas sarkozy said " the debate is open " on whether applications to join the euro group could be sped up .
however the french leader backed away from supporting present-day exemptions to criteria for joining the bloc .
" in the future , when the crisis is over , we should look and see what we have learnt from the crisis … to see if we should integrate new criteria , " sarkozy said .
solution to downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany , left , and topolanek say economic conditions should be considered fast-tracked membership of the european single market is increasingly being seen by some eastern european states as a way of stabilizing their struggling economies , which have been hit hard by the global credit squeeze and economic downturn .
hungary and poland have floated the idea of speeding up their applications for euro zone membership to this effect .
" we have to accelerate the process of joining the euro zone , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany told journalists ahead of the brussels summit .
he agreed that euro candidates should adhere to the rigorous economic conditions for joining the bloc , but that the two-year erm ii waiting period was too long .
" we should not allow a new ' iron curtain ' to … divide europe into two parts , " he said , warning of the growing division between rich and poor countries because of the economic crisis .
" at the beginning of the 90s , we reunified europe .
now it is another challenge - whether we can unify europe in terms of financing and its economy , " he said .
economic conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick announced a multi-billion-euro aid package for eastern european banks czech prime minister mirek topolanek said leaders at the summit agreed to the possibility of a discussion on whether the euro accession rulebook needed to take better consideration of economic conditions .
" we said that we could have a discussion as to whether the rules are too soft in the times when the economy is booming and too strict in times when we are in more difficulty , " said topolanek , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he acknowledged however that quick changes to the rules were out of the question .
" i do n't think that anybody who was there -lrb- at the summit -rrb- as a head of state or government accepted the idea of changing the rules at the moment . "
prospective euro candidates usually have to respect five economic conditions before adopting the currency .
they must keep deficits and debt down , their currencies stable , long-term interest rates in line with targets and inflation under control in a sustainable way . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .
eu sources say that around 100 billion euros of that will need to be spent in developing countries . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "

topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .

but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "
the specter of a new iron curtain was raised at the start of the talks by hungary 's premier ferenc gyurcsany . " in the beginning of the 1990s , we reunified europe .
now the challenge is to reunify europe financially : we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe „ said gyurcsany , whose cash-strapped country has required an international bail-out .
in their joint statement , leaders agreed to allay such concerns by acknowledging " clear differences between the member states in central and eastern europe " , rather than along an east-west divide .
while poland and slovakia are in sound financial shape , expecting modest economic growth this year , hungary and latvia have already been forced to look for rescue from international institutions . leaders reject talk of divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's heavy hitters rejected talk of a split in the bloc sunday 's summit was called by the czech presidency in a bid to shore up unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that it may risk breaking into splinter groups .
topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .
and hungarian calls for the creation of a 190-billion-euro -lrb- $ 240-billion -rrb- crisis fund for the whole region were dismissed by the eu 's richest nation , with german chancellor angela merkel saying : " the situation is very different .

it has taught us one thing .
political principles that seemed unshakeable just a few weeks ago no longer apply .
and no one can predict with certainty what action will be needed to avert catastrophe in the weeks ahead .
the explicit " no " to a rescue plan for the ailing economies of eastern europe may also not stand the test of time .
german chancellor angela merkel and czech prime minster mirek topolanek whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , are currently resisting calls for eu cash injections for hungary , latvia , romania , bulgaria et al .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's bernd riegert but is the hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany exaggerating when he says that eu member states in eastern europe need a support fund of up to 190 billion euros to restore solvency ?
or could some eu states really be at risk of bankruptcy in the near future because they can not afford private sector loans ?
as recently as december , many eastern european governments were maintaining that they had not been hit by the financial crisis .
now , they are standing at the edge of the abyss . and things continue to develop apace .
there are already signs that the financial crisis could also endanger the euro , which is used by 16 eu states .
the euro is already feeling the pinch on the currency markets .
eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquín almunia has warned about the danger of the flight of capital .
ireland , greece , spain and italy are finding it increasingly difficult to find buyers for their government bonds .
germany , one of the biggest and strongest eu economies , balks at having to step in and prop up other member states because it would mean that it would also have to increase the interest rates on its own government bonds to attract buyers .
eu leaders did not come up with any answers to these particular questions at their hastily convened summit meetings .
however , state representatives were at least united in speaking out against protectionism .
they were adamant that the single market must continue to function and that no countries should go it alone .
that is a good thing .
in the current financial situation any seizing up of the internal market would quickly lead the eu into rack and ruin .
eu members also agree that there is a need to tighten regulation and oversight for banks .
they intend to co-ordinate the states ' rescue plans and economic stimulus programs .
the bloc is also making progress on the issue of how to deal with the problem of the worthless - so-called toxic - assets held by european banks .
eu members have reached a consensus on the need to establish common standards .
they also agree that state debt , despite the burden of expensive stimulus programs , should not be allowed to spiral out of control .
this degree of unity would have been unthinkable just a few months ago . the europeans are being bounced into taking action by the force of events .
but the europeans must now make sure that they act resolutely at the summit of the world 's 20 most important economic powers on 2 april in london .
some of the problems being faced elsewhere put the difficulties faced by some european states into perspective , and threaten to overshadow them .
europe has to ensure that it remains competitive .
the impromptu summit in brussels has shown that the small eu member states are not prepared to be left out .
the meeting was a retort in kinds to last week 's meeting in berlin ahead of the g20 summit where only the major eu states .
but now is not the time for internal squabbling .
this crisis is far too serious for that . bernd riegert / jg / nda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel said after an eu summit in brussels on sunday , march 1 , that the bloc " could consider " shortening the minimum two-year preparatory phase for euro membership .
" there are requests to join erm ii faster , " merkel said .
" we can have a look at that . "

euro candidates are expected to participate in erm ii for at least two years before adopting the euro .

german chancellor angela merkel said after an eu summit in brussels on sunday , march 1 , that the bloc " could consider " shortening the minimum two-year preparatory phase for euro membership .
" there are requests to join erm ii faster , " merkel said .
" we can have a look at that . "
the exchange rate mechanism ii currency grid , or erm ii , is an agreement to maintain stable exchange rates between the euro and the currency of the euro zone applicant state to avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations on the internal market .
euro candidates are expected to participate in erm ii for at least two years before adopting the euro .
hungary , poland and czech republic are among several states awaiting erm ii status .
estonia , lithuania and latvia , meanwhile , have been erm ii participants for a number of years but have so far been barred from taking up the euro .
french president nicolas sarkozy said " the debate is open " on whether applications to join the euro group could be sped up .
however the french leader backed away from supporting present-day exemptions to criteria for joining the bloc .
" in the future , when the crisis is over , we should look and see what we have learnt from the crisis … to see if we should integrate new criteria , " sarkozy said .
solution to downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany , left , and topolanek say economic conditions should be considered fast-tracked membership of the european single market is increasingly being seen by some eastern european states as a way of stabilizing their struggling economies , which have been hit hard by the global credit squeeze and economic downturn .
hungary and poland have floated the idea of speeding up their applications for euro zone membership to this effect .
" we have to accelerate the process of joining the euro zone , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany told journalists ahead of the brussels summit .
he agreed that euro candidates should adhere to the rigorous economic conditions for joining the bloc , but that the two-year erm ii waiting period was too long .
" we should not allow a new ' iron curtain ' to … divide europe into two parts , " he said , warning of the growing division between rich and poor countries because of the economic crisis .
" at the beginning of the 90s , we reunified europe .
now it is another challenge - whether we can unify europe in terms of financing and its economy , " he said .
economic conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick announced a multi-billion-euro aid package for eastern european banks czech prime minister mirek topolanek said leaders at the summit agreed to the possibility of a discussion on whether the euro accession rulebook needed to take better consideration of economic conditions .
" we said that we could have a discussion as to whether the rules are too soft in the times when the economy is booming and too strict in times when we are in more difficulty , " said topolanek , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he acknowledged however that quick changes to the rules were out of the question .
" i do n't think that anybody who was there -lrb- at the summit -rrb- as a head of state or government accepted the idea of changing the rules at the moment . "
prospective euro candidates usually have to respect five economic conditions before adopting the currency .
they must keep deficits and debt down , their currencies stable , long-term interest rates in line with targets and inflation under control in a sustainable way . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel said after an eu summit in brussels on sunday , march 1 , that the bloc " could consider " shortening the minimum two-year preparatory phase for euro membership .
" there are requests to join erm ii faster , " merkel said .
" we can have a look at that . "
the exchange rate mechanism ii currency grid , or erm ii , is an agreement to maintain stable exchange rates between the euro and the currency of the euro zone applicant state to avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations on the internal market .
euro candidates are expected to participate in erm ii for at least two years before adopting the euro .
hungary , poland and czech republic are among several states awaiting erm ii status .
estonia , lithuania and latvia , meanwhile , have been erm ii participants for a number of years but have so far been barred from taking up the euro .
french president nicolas sarkozy said " the debate is open " on whether applications to join the euro group could be sped up .
however the french leader backed away from supporting present-day exemptions to criteria for joining the bloc .
" in the future , when the crisis is over , we should look and see what we have learnt from the crisis … to see if we should integrate new criteria , " sarkozy said .
solution to downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany , left , and topolanek say economic conditions should be considered fast-tracked membership of the european single market is increasingly being seen by some eastern european states as a way of stabilizing their struggling economies , which have been hit hard by the global credit squeeze and economic downturn .
hungary and poland have floated the idea of speeding up their applications for euro zone membership to this effect .
" we have to accelerate the process of joining the euro zone , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany told journalists ahead of the brussels summit .
he agreed that euro candidates should adhere to the rigorous economic conditions for joining the bloc , but that the two-year erm ii waiting period was too long .
" we should not allow a new ' iron curtain ' to … divide europe into two parts , " he said , warning of the growing division between rich and poor countries because of the economic crisis .
" at the beginning of the 90s , we reunified europe .
now it is another challenge - whether we can unify europe in terms of financing and its economy , " he said .
economic conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick announced a multi-billion-euro aid package for eastern european banks czech prime minister mirek topolanek said leaders at the summit agreed to the possibility of a discussion on whether the euro accession rulebook needed to take better consideration of economic conditions .
" we said that we could have a discussion as to whether the rules are too soft in the times when the economy is booming and too strict in times when we are in more difficulty , " said topolanek , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he acknowledged however that quick changes to the rules were out of the question .
" i do n't think that anybody who was there -lrb- at the summit -rrb- as a head of state or government accepted the idea of changing the rules at the moment . "

a large chunk of germany 's second state financial aid package will go toward modernizing the military .
the defense minister says the move will create jobs , but some say there are better uses for a stimulus money . over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 634 million -rrb- of the federal 50-billion-euro package have been earmarked for the military , according to the german ministry of defense .
more than 250 million euros will go toward renovating existing and constructing new facilities , including barracks and other buildings .
the german military " is an important source of contracts for the german economy , so it only makes sense that it will make the most of the possibilities to continue its support in the context of the economic stimulus package , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung in a statement .
jung added that the defense ministry 's plans to spend the funds would not only support small and mid-sized german businesses , but would also help protect the lives of its soldiers .
modern military gear an additional 250 million euros are to be invested in high-tech military equipment .
according to the defense ministry , " dingo " patrol vehicles would be purchased for use on foreign deployments and new " seafox " drones would quickly make underwater mine detection without human divers a reality .
according to a report published on sunday , march 1 , by the financial times web site , 1,000 heckler & koch sub-machine guns and 10 armored fenneck reconnaissance vehicles were also on the list .
heckler & koch is a german company , while fennecks are made by a german-dutch conglomerate .
" it is bogus to claim the purchase of tanks and combat drones represents an economic stimulus program , " said left party parliamentarian inge hoege , as quoted by the financial times .
berlin 's second stimulus package was approved by parliament last month .
it follows a 50 billion-euro aid package from november 2008 .

the donors also called for an immediate lifting of israel 's blockade of the battered coastal strip preventing all but vital aid from entering the area .
gaza has an estimated 1.4 million inhabitants .
" the status quo is of benefit to all the extremism .
it is time for us to speed up the agenda , " french president nicolas sarkozy told the conference at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
final figures from the conference show the eu has pledged $ 554 million , the us $ 900 million and gulf arab states $ 1.65 billion in aid for the palestinians .
germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas had asked for some $ 2.8 billion , almost half of that to pay for the reconstruction of the gaza strip after israel 's offensive in late december and january .
" we are confronted with a serious dilemma , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told a final news conference .
" will we once again reconstruct something we built a few years ago and now has been hammered and flattened ?
" many donors , despite pledges , will wish to see political progress before they commit to infrastructure reconstruction , " he said .
norway and egypt jointly presided over the conference .
gaza remains sealed off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between egypt and gaza also remains closed but the united nations and aid agencies have said that rebuilding the coastal enclave would be extremely difficult as long as border crossings into gaza remain closed . " the situation at the border crossings is intolerable .
aid workers do not have access .
essential commodities can not get in , " un secretary-general ban ki-moon told donors at the conference .
" our first and indispensable goal , therefore , is to open crossings .
by the same token , however , it is therefore essential to ensure that illegal weapons do not enter gaza . "
" money is very important but it is not going to solve the problem unless there is pressure from the international community on israel to open all -lrb- border -rrb- crossings with gaza " said gasser abdel-razek , a spokesman for human rights group oxfam international .
french president nicolas sarkozy called on israel to open the border crossings and allow goods through .
" gaza should not actually be a prison with open skies , " he told the conference .
money will not end up " in the wrong hands " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donors do not want hamas to receive the cash donors have balked at giving aid to hamas , which has controlled the strip since 2007 .
in response , leaders of hamas and abbas 's rival fatah faction agreed to work towards forming a " national unity " government on thursday , feb .
26 , and to hold fresh elections soon . us secretary of state hillary clinton , who was making her first appearance at such a large-scale conference in her new role , reassured delegates on monday that the us was working with the palestinian authority to install " safeguards " to ensure that funding " is only used where and for whom it is intended " and " does not end up in the wrong hands . "
she also stressed that the response to the current gaza crisis " can not be separated " from broader peace efforts , adding that aid to gaza could " foster conditions in which a palestinian state can be fully realized . "
neither israel nor hamas were present at the conference .
israel said it supported efforts to help palestinians in the strip , but wanted assurances the aid money would not reach hamas militants .
" we definitely do n't want to see the goodwill of the international community exploited by hamas and serve hamas ' extremist purposes , " said mark regev , a spokesman for prime minister ehud olmert .
more than 1,300 palestinians were killed and thousands of gaza homes and government buildings were reduced to rubble during the israeli offensive .

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .

" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .

german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.03.2009 eu leaders signal possible fast-tracks in euro membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several eu states want faster euro zone membership the leaders of several euro zone member states have given tacit signals that applications to join the single-currency bloc could be expedited as the financial crisis rolls on . the leaders said however that stringent criteria for taking up the euro would not be relaxed , despite the gloomy economic conditions pressuring applicant-states .
german chancellor angela merkel said after an eu summit in brussels on sunday , march 1 , that the bloc " could consider " shortening the minimum two-year preparatory phase for euro membership .
" there are requests to join erm ii faster , " merkel said .
" we can have a look at that . "
the exchange rate mechanism ii currency grid , or erm ii , is an agreement to maintain stable exchange rates between the euro and the currency of the euro zone applicant state to avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations on the internal market .
euro candidates are expected to participate in erm ii for at least two years before adopting the euro .
hungary , poland and czech republic are among several states awaiting erm ii status .
estonia , lithuania and latvia , meanwhile , have been erm ii participants for a number of years but have so far been barred from taking up the euro .
french president nicolas sarkozy said " the debate is open " on whether applications to join the euro group could be sped up .
however the french leader backed away from supporting present-day exemptions to criteria for joining the bloc .
" in the future , when the crisis is over , we should look and see what we have learnt from the crisis … to see if we should integrate new criteria , " sarkozy said .
solution to downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany , left , and topolanek say economic conditions should be considered fast-tracked membership of the european single market is increasingly being seen by some eastern european states as a way of stabilizing their struggling economies , which have been hit hard by the global credit squeeze and economic downturn .
hungary and poland have floated the idea of speeding up their applications for euro zone membership to this effect .
" we have to accelerate the process of joining the euro zone , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany told journalists ahead of the brussels summit .
he agreed that euro candidates should adhere to the rigorous economic conditions for joining the bloc , but that the two-year erm ii waiting period was too long .
" we should not allow a new ' iron curtain ' to … divide europe into two parts , " he said , warning of the growing division between rich and poor countries because of the economic crisis .
" at the beginning of the 90s , we reunified europe .
now it is another challenge - whether we can unify europe in terms of financing and its economy , " he said .
economic conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick announced a multi-billion-euro aid package for eastern european banks czech prime minister mirek topolanek said leaders at the summit agreed to the possibility of a discussion on whether the euro accession rulebook needed to take better consideration of economic conditions .
" we said that we could have a discussion as to whether the rules are too soft in the times when the economy is booming and too strict in times when we are in more difficulty , " said topolanek , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he acknowledged however that quick changes to the rules were out of the question .
" i do n't think that anybody who was there -lrb- at the summit -rrb- as a head of state or government accepted the idea of changing the rules at the moment . "
prospective euro candidates usually have to respect five economic conditions before adopting the currency .
they must keep deficits and debt down , their currencies stable , long-term interest rates in line with targets and inflation under control in a sustainable way . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "
the specter of a new iron curtain was raised at the start of the talks by hungary 's premier ferenc gyurcsany . " in the beginning of the 1990s , we reunified europe .
now the challenge is to reunify europe financially : we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe „ said gyurcsany , whose cash-strapped country has required an international bail-out .
in their joint statement , leaders agreed to allay such concerns by acknowledging " clear differences between the member states in central and eastern europe " , rather than along an east-west divide .
while poland and slovakia are in sound financial shape , expecting modest economic growth this year , hungary and latvia have already been forced to look for rescue from international institutions . leaders reject talk of divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's heavy hitters rejected talk of a split in the bloc sunday 's summit was called by the czech presidency in a bid to shore up unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that it may risk breaking into splinter groups .
topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .
and hungarian calls for the creation of a 190-billion-euro -lrb- $ 240-billion -rrb- crisis fund for the whole region were dismissed by the eu 's richest nation , with german chancellor angela merkel saying : " the situation is very different .
we can not compare slovakia or slovenia with hungary . "
as philip white , senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform put it : " leaders are acutely aware of the parlous economic background , so they will bend over backwards to come out with soothing statements .

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .

" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .

he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .

"
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .

opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .
reading the fine print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top opel and gm executives have been presenting their restructuring plans the economics minister said the company 's restructuring plan first had to be examined in detail .
" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm echoed guttenberg 's sentiments .
he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .
wilhelm said the company 's business plan would first be checked by independent financial auditors to determine its sustainability .
cautious approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an onerous task for germany 's new finance minister guttenberg has been careful to avoid premature promises , telling germany 's ard television ahead of the meeting that the german government would conduct a " very far-reaching examination " of the company 's proposals to ensure that opel has " a truly viable perspective for the future . "
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .
a portion of the government bailout is likely to come from the state budgets .
some 25,000 people in germany are employed by opel . dfm / jg / kjb / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "
the specter of a new iron curtain was raised at the start of the talks by hungary 's premier ferenc gyurcsany . " in the beginning of the 1990s , we reunified europe .
now the challenge is to reunify europe financially : we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe „ said gyurcsany , whose cash-strapped country has required an international bail-out .
in their joint statement , leaders agreed to allay such concerns by acknowledging " clear differences between the member states in central and eastern europe " , rather than along an east-west divide .
while poland and slovakia are in sound financial shape , expecting modest economic growth this year , hungary and latvia have already been forced to look for rescue from international institutions . leaders reject talk of divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's heavy hitters rejected talk of a split in the bloc sunday 's summit was called by the czech presidency in a bid to shore up unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that it may risk breaking into splinter groups .
topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .
and hungarian calls for the creation of a 190-billion-euro -lrb- $ 240-billion -rrb- crisis fund for the whole region were dismissed by the eu 's richest nation , with german chancellor angela merkel saying : " the situation is very different .
we can not compare slovakia or slovenia with hungary . "
as philip white , senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform put it : " leaders are acutely aware of the parlous economic background , so they will bend over backwards to come out with soothing statements .

but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "
the specter of a new iron curtain was raised at the start of the talks by hungary 's premier ferenc gyurcsany . " in the beginning of the 1990s , we reunified europe .
now the challenge is to reunify europe financially : we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe „ said gyurcsany , whose cash-strapped country has required an international bail-out .
in their joint statement , leaders agreed to allay such concerns by acknowledging " clear differences between the member states in central and eastern europe " , rather than along an east-west divide .
while poland and slovakia are in sound financial shape , expecting modest economic growth this year , hungary and latvia have already been forced to look for rescue from international institutions . leaders reject talk of divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's heavy hitters rejected talk of a split in the bloc sunday 's summit was called by the czech presidency in a bid to shore up unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that it may risk breaking into splinter groups .
topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .
and hungarian calls for the creation of a 190-billion-euro -lrb- $ 240-billion -rrb- crisis fund for the whole region were dismissed by the eu 's richest nation , with german chancellor angela merkel saying : " the situation is very different .

it has taught us one thing .
political principles that seemed unshakeable just a few weeks ago no longer apply .
and no one can predict with certainty what action will be needed to avert catastrophe in the weeks ahead .
the explicit " no " to a rescue plan for the ailing economies of eastern europe may also not stand the test of time .
german chancellor angela merkel and czech prime minster mirek topolanek whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , are currently resisting calls for eu cash injections for hungary , latvia , romania , bulgaria et al .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's bernd riegert but is the hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany exaggerating when he says that eu member states in eastern europe need a support fund of up to 190 billion euros to restore solvency ?
or could some eu states really be at risk of bankruptcy in the near future because they can not afford private sector loans ?
as recently as december , many eastern european governments were maintaining that they had not been hit by the financial crisis .
now , they are standing at the edge of the abyss . and things continue to develop apace .
there are already signs that the financial crisis could also endanger the euro , which is used by 16 eu states .
the euro is already feeling the pinch on the currency markets .
eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquín almunia has warned about the danger of the flight of capital .
ireland , greece , spain and italy are finding it increasingly difficult to find buyers for their government bonds .
germany , one of the biggest and strongest eu economies , balks at having to step in and prop up other member states because it would mean that it would also have to increase the interest rates on its own government bonds to attract buyers .
eu leaders did not come up with any answers to these particular questions at their hastily convened summit meetings .
however , state representatives were at least united in speaking out against protectionism .
they were adamant that the single market must continue to function and that no countries should go it alone .
that is a good thing .
in the current financial situation any seizing up of the internal market would quickly lead the eu into rack and ruin .
eu members also agree that there is a need to tighten regulation and oversight for banks .
they intend to co-ordinate the states ' rescue plans and economic stimulus programs .
the bloc is also making progress on the issue of how to deal with the problem of the worthless - so-called toxic - assets held by european banks .
eu members have reached a consensus on the need to establish common standards .
they also agree that state debt , despite the burden of expensive stimulus programs , should not be allowed to spiral out of control .
this degree of unity would have been unthinkable just a few months ago . the europeans are being bounced into taking action by the force of events .
but the europeans must now make sure that they act resolutely at the summit of the world 's 20 most important economic powers on 2 april in london .
some of the problems being faced elsewhere put the difficulties faced by some european states into perspective , and threaten to overshadow them .
europe has to ensure that it remains competitive .
the impromptu summit in brussels has shown that the small eu member states are not prepared to be left out .
the meeting was a retort in kinds to last week 's meeting in berlin ahead of the g20 summit where only the major eu states .
but now is not the time for internal squabbling .
this crisis is far too serious for that . bernd riegert / jg / nda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.03.2009 world pledges billions for gaza reconstruction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 22-day offensive destroyed many homes and government buildings in gaza the eu , us and arab states have pledged close to $ 4.5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billion euros -rrb- to help rebuild the war-torn gaza strip and reform the palestinian authority . but as donors met in egypt on monday , march 2 , they emphasized that financial aid must not fall into the hands of hamas , the islamist group which rules gaza .
the donors also called for an immediate lifting of israel 's blockade of the battered coastal strip preventing all but vital aid from entering the area .
gaza has an estimated 1.4 million inhabitants .
" the status quo is of benefit to all the extremism .
it is time for us to speed up the agenda , " french president nicolas sarkozy told the conference at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
final figures from the conference show the eu has pledged $ 554 million , the us $ 900 million and gulf arab states $ 1.65 billion in aid for the palestinians .
germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas had asked for some $ 2.8 billion , almost half of that to pay for the reconstruction of the gaza strip after israel 's offensive in late december and january .
" we are confronted with a serious dilemma , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told a final news conference .
" will we once again reconstruct something we built a few years ago and now has been hammered and flattened ?
" many donors , despite pledges , will wish to see political progress before they commit to infrastructure reconstruction , " he said .
norway and egypt jointly presided over the conference .
gaza remains sealed off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between egypt and gaza also remains closed but the united nations and aid agencies have said that rebuilding the coastal enclave would be extremely difficult as long as border crossings into gaza remain closed . " the situation at the border crossings is intolerable .
aid workers do not have access .
essential commodities can not get in , " un secretary-general ban ki-moon told donors at the conference .
" our first and indispensable goal , therefore , is to open crossings .
by the same token , however , it is therefore essential to ensure that illegal weapons do not enter gaza . "
" money is very important but it is not going to solve the problem unless there is pressure from the international community on israel to open all -lrb- border -rrb- crossings with gaza " said gasser abdel-razek , a spokesman for human rights group oxfam international .
french president nicolas sarkozy called on israel to open the border crossings and allow goods through .

germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .

as recently as december , many eastern european governments were maintaining that they had not been hit by the financial crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2009 austria , hungary allowed to keep ban on genetically modified crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria and hungary have maintained their right to ban gm crops , for now germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , has voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize . eu environment ministers meeting in brussels on monday , march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow us biotech giant monsanto 's mon810 gm maize grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .
eu sources say that around 100 billion euros of that will need to be spent in developing countries . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .
reading the fine print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top opel and gm executives have been presenting their restructuring plans the economics minister said the company 's restructuring plan first had to be examined in detail .
" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm echoed guttenberg 's sentiments .
he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .
wilhelm said the company 's business plan would first be checked by independent financial auditors to determine its sustainability .
cautious approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an onerous task for germany 's new finance minister guttenberg has been careful to avoid premature promises , telling germany 's ard television ahead of the meeting that the german government would conduct a " very far-reaching examination " of the company 's proposals to ensure that opel has " a truly viable perspective for the future . "
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .
a portion of the government bailout is likely to come from the state budgets .
some 25,000 people in germany are employed by opel . dfm / jg / kjb / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the donors also called for an immediate lifting of israel 's blockade of the battered coastal strip preventing all but vital aid from entering the area .
gaza has an estimated 1.4 million inhabitants .
" the status quo is of benefit to all the extremism .
it is time for us to speed up the agenda , " french president nicolas sarkozy told the conference at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
final figures from the conference show the eu has pledged $ 554 million , the us $ 900 million and gulf arab states $ 1.65 billion in aid for the palestinians .
germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .

aid workers do not have access .
essential commodities can not get in , " un secretary-general ban ki-moon told donors at the conference .
" our first and indispensable goal , therefore , is to open crossings .
by the same token , however , it is therefore essential to ensure that illegal weapons do not enter gaza . "
" money is very important but it is not going to solve the problem unless there is pressure from the international community on israel to open all -lrb- border -rrb- crossings with gaza " said gasser abdel-razek , a spokesman for human rights group oxfam international .

"
she also stressed that the response to the current gaza crisis " can not be separated " from broader peace efforts , adding that aid to gaza could " foster conditions in which a palestinian state can be fully realized . "
neither israel nor hamas were present at the conference .
israel said it supported efforts to help palestinians in the strip , but wanted assurances the aid money would not reach hamas militants .

the donors also called for an immediate lifting of israel 's blockade of the battered coastal strip preventing all but vital aid from entering the area .
gaza has an estimated 1.4 million inhabitants .
" the status quo is of benefit to all the extremism .
it is time for us to speed up the agenda , " french president nicolas sarkozy told the conference at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
final figures from the conference show the eu has pledged $ 554 million , the us $ 900 million and gulf arab states $ 1.65 billion in aid for the palestinians .
germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas had asked for some $ 2.8 billion , almost half of that to pay for the reconstruction of the gaza strip after israel 's offensive in late december and january .
" we are confronted with a serious dilemma , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told a final news conference .
" will we once again reconstruct something we built a few years ago and now has been hammered and flattened ?
" many donors , despite pledges , will wish to see political progress before they commit to infrastructure reconstruction , " he said .
norway and egypt jointly presided over the conference .
gaza remains sealed off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between egypt and gaza also remains closed but the united nations and aid agencies have said that rebuilding the coastal enclave would be extremely difficult as long as border crossings into gaza remain closed . " the situation at the border crossings is intolerable .
aid workers do not have access .
essential commodities can not get in , " un secretary-general ban ki-moon told donors at the conference .
" our first and indispensable goal , therefore , is to open crossings .
by the same token , however , it is therefore essential to ensure that illegal weapons do not enter gaza . "
" money is very important but it is not going to solve the problem unless there is pressure from the international community on israel to open all -lrb- border -rrb- crossings with gaza " said gasser abdel-razek , a spokesman for human rights group oxfam international .
french president nicolas sarkozy called on israel to open the border crossings and allow goods through .
" gaza should not actually be a prison with open skies , " he told the conference .
money will not end up " in the wrong hands " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donors do not want hamas to receive the cash donors have balked at giving aid to hamas , which has controlled the strip since 2007 .
in response , leaders of hamas and abbas 's rival fatah faction agreed to work towards forming a " national unity " government on thursday , feb .
26 , and to hold fresh elections soon . us secretary of state hillary clinton , who was making her first appearance at such a large-scale conference in her new role , reassured delegates on monday that the us was working with the palestinian authority to install " safeguards " to ensure that funding " is only used where and for whom it is intended " and " does not end up in the wrong hands . "
she also stressed that the response to the current gaza crisis " can not be separated " from broader peace efforts , adding that aid to gaza could " foster conditions in which a palestinian state can be fully realized . "
neither israel nor hamas were present at the conference .
israel said it supported efforts to help palestinians in the strip , but wanted assurances the aid money would not reach hamas militants .
" we definitely do n't want to see the goodwill of the international community exploited by hamas and serve hamas ' extremist purposes , " said mark regev , a spokesman for prime minister ehud olmert .
more than 1,300 palestinians were killed and thousands of gaza homes and government buildings were reduced to rubble during the israeli offensive .
thirteen israelis also died in attacks by hamas militants . dfm / jg / nda / th / reuters / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .

" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm echoed guttenberg 's sentiments .
he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .

"
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .

a large chunk of germany 's second state financial aid package will go toward modernizing the military .
the defense minister says the move will create jobs , but some say there are better uses for a stimulus money . over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 634 million -rrb- of the federal 50-billion-euro package have been earmarked for the military , according to the german ministry of defense .
more than 250 million euros will go toward renovating existing and constructing new facilities , including barracks and other buildings .
the german military " is an important source of contracts for the german economy , so it only makes sense that it will make the most of the possibilities to continue its support in the context of the economic stimulus package , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung in a statement .
jung added that the defense ministry 's plans to spend the funds would not only support small and mid-sized german businesses , but would also help protect the lives of its soldiers .
modern military gear an additional 250 million euros are to be invested in high-tech military equipment .
according to the defense ministry , " dingo " patrol vehicles would be purchased for use on foreign deployments and new " seafox " drones would quickly make underwater mine detection without human divers a reality .
according to a report published on sunday , march 1 , by the financial times web site , 1,000 heckler & koch sub-machine guns and 10 armored fenneck reconnaissance vehicles were also on the list .
heckler & koch is a german company , while fennecks are made by a german-dutch conglomerate .
" it is bogus to claim the purchase of tanks and combat drones represents an economic stimulus program , " said left party parliamentarian inge hoege , as quoted by the financial times .

only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .

only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .
reading the fine print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top opel and gm executives have been presenting their restructuring plans the economics minister said the company 's restructuring plan first had to be examined in detail .
" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm echoed guttenberg 's sentiments .
he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .
wilhelm said the company 's business plan would first be checked by independent financial auditors to determine its sustainability .
cautious approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an onerous task for germany 's new finance minister guttenberg has been careful to avoid premature promises , telling germany 's ard television ahead of the meeting that the german government would conduct a " very far-reaching examination " of the company 's proposals to ensure that opel has " a truly viable perspective for the future . "
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .
a portion of the government bailout is likely to come from the state budgets .

german chancellor angela merkel said after an eu summit in brussels on sunday , march 1 , that the bloc " could consider " shortening the minimum two-year preparatory phase for euro membership .
" there are requests to join erm ii faster , " merkel said .
" we can have a look at that . "
the exchange rate mechanism ii currency grid , or erm ii , is an agreement to maintain stable exchange rates between the euro and the currency of the euro zone applicant state to avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations on the internal market .
euro candidates are expected to participate in erm ii for at least two years before adopting the euro .
hungary , poland and czech republic are among several states awaiting erm ii status .
estonia , lithuania and latvia , meanwhile , have been erm ii participants for a number of years but have so far been barred from taking up the euro .
french president nicolas sarkozy said " the debate is open " on whether applications to join the euro group could be sped up .
however the french leader backed away from supporting present-day exemptions to criteria for joining the bloc .
" in the future , when the crisis is over , we should look and see what we have learnt from the crisis … to see if we should integrate new criteria , " sarkozy said .
solution to downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany , left , and topolanek say economic conditions should be considered fast-tracked membership of the european single market is increasingly being seen by some eastern european states as a way of stabilizing their struggling economies , which have been hit hard by the global credit squeeze and economic downturn .
hungary and poland have floated the idea of speeding up their applications for euro zone membership to this effect .
" we have to accelerate the process of joining the euro zone , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany told journalists ahead of the brussels summit .
he agreed that euro candidates should adhere to the rigorous economic conditions for joining the bloc , but that the two-year erm ii waiting period was too long .
" we should not allow a new ' iron curtain ' to … divide europe into two parts , " he said , warning of the growing division between rich and poor countries because of the economic crisis .
" at the beginning of the 90s , we reunified europe .
now it is another challenge - whether we can unify europe in terms of financing and its economy , " he said .
economic conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick announced a multi-billion-euro aid package for eastern european banks czech prime minister mirek topolanek said leaders at the summit agreed to the possibility of a discussion on whether the euro accession rulebook needed to take better consideration of economic conditions .
" we said that we could have a discussion as to whether the rules are too soft in the times when the economy is booming and too strict in times when we are in more difficulty , " said topolanek , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he acknowledged however that quick changes to the rules were out of the question .
" i do n't think that anybody who was there -lrb- at the summit -rrb- as a head of state or government accepted the idea of changing the rules at the moment . "
prospective euro candidates usually have to respect five economic conditions before adopting the currency .
they must keep deficits and debt down , their currencies stable , long-term interest rates in line with targets and inflation under control in a sustainable way . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.03.2009 eu leaders signal possible fast-tracks in euro membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several eu states want faster euro zone membership the leaders of several euro zone member states have given tacit signals that applications to join the single-currency bloc could be expedited as the financial crisis rolls on . the leaders said however that stringent criteria for taking up the euro would not be relaxed , despite the gloomy economic conditions pressuring applicant-states .
german chancellor angela merkel said after an eu summit in brussels on sunday , march 1 , that the bloc " could consider " shortening the minimum two-year preparatory phase for euro membership .
" there are requests to join erm ii faster , " merkel said .
" we can have a look at that . "
the exchange rate mechanism ii currency grid , or erm ii , is an agreement to maintain stable exchange rates between the euro and the currency of the euro zone applicant state to avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations on the internal market .
euro candidates are expected to participate in erm ii for at least two years before adopting the euro .
hungary , poland and czech republic are among several states awaiting erm ii status .
estonia , lithuania and latvia , meanwhile , have been erm ii participants for a number of years but have so far been barred from taking up the euro .
french president nicolas sarkozy said " the debate is open " on whether applications to join the euro group could be sped up .
however the french leader backed away from supporting present-day exemptions to criteria for joining the bloc .
" in the future , when the crisis is over , we should look and see what we have learnt from the crisis … to see if we should integrate new criteria , " sarkozy said .
solution to downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany , left , and topolanek say economic conditions should be considered fast-tracked membership of the european single market is increasingly being seen by some eastern european states as a way of stabilizing their struggling economies , which have been hit hard by the global credit squeeze and economic downturn .
hungary and poland have floated the idea of speeding up their applications for euro zone membership to this effect .
" we have to accelerate the process of joining the euro zone , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany told journalists ahead of the brussels summit .
he agreed that euro candidates should adhere to the rigorous economic conditions for joining the bloc , but that the two-year erm ii waiting period was too long .
" we should not allow a new ' iron curtain ' to … divide europe into two parts , " he said , warning of the growing division between rich and poor countries because of the economic crisis .
" at the beginning of the 90s , we reunified europe .
now it is another challenge - whether we can unify europe in terms of financing and its economy , " he said .
economic conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick announced a multi-billion-euro aid package for eastern european banks czech prime minister mirek topolanek said leaders at the summit agreed to the possibility of a discussion on whether the euro accession rulebook needed to take better consideration of economic conditions .
" we said that we could have a discussion as to whether the rules are too soft in the times when the economy is booming and too strict in times when we are in more difficulty , " said topolanek , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he acknowledged however that quick changes to the rules were out of the question .
" i do n't think that anybody who was there -lrb- at the summit -rrb- as a head of state or government accepted the idea of changing the rules at the moment . "
prospective euro candidates usually have to respect five economic conditions before adopting the currency .
they must keep deficits and debt down , their currencies stable , long-term interest rates in line with targets and inflation under control in a sustainable way . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.03.2009 world pledges billions for gaza reconstruction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 22-day offensive destroyed many homes and government buildings in gaza the eu , us and arab states have pledged close to $ 4.5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billion euros -rrb- to help rebuild the war-torn gaza strip and reform the palestinian authority . but as donors met in egypt on monday , march 2 , they emphasized that financial aid must not fall into the hands of hamas , the islamist group which rules gaza .
the donors also called for an immediate lifting of israel 's blockade of the battered coastal strip preventing all but vital aid from entering the area .
gaza has an estimated 1.4 million inhabitants .
" the status quo is of benefit to all the extremism .
it is time for us to speed up the agenda , " french president nicolas sarkozy told the conference at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
final figures from the conference show the eu has pledged $ 554 million , the us $ 900 million and gulf arab states $ 1.65 billion in aid for the palestinians .
germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas had asked for some $ 2.8 billion , almost half of that to pay for the reconstruction of the gaza strip after israel 's offensive in late december and january .
" we are confronted with a serious dilemma , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told a final news conference .
" will we once again reconstruct something we built a few years ago and now has been hammered and flattened ?
" many donors , despite pledges , will wish to see political progress before they commit to infrastructure reconstruction , " he said .
norway and egypt jointly presided over the conference .
gaza remains sealed off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between egypt and gaza also remains closed but the united nations and aid agencies have said that rebuilding the coastal enclave would be extremely difficult as long as border crossings into gaza remain closed . " the situation at the border crossings is intolerable .
aid workers do not have access .
essential commodities can not get in , " un secretary-general ban ki-moon told donors at the conference .
" our first and indispensable goal , therefore , is to open crossings .
by the same token , however , it is therefore essential to ensure that illegal weapons do not enter gaza . "
" money is very important but it is not going to solve the problem unless there is pressure from the international community on israel to open all -lrb- border -rrb- crossings with gaza " said gasser abdel-razek , a spokesman for human rights group oxfam international .
french president nicolas sarkozy called on israel to open the border crossings and allow goods through .
" gaza should not actually be a prison with open skies , " he told the conference .
money will not end up " in the wrong hands " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donors do not want hamas to receive the cash donors have balked at giving aid to hamas , which has controlled the strip since 2007 .
in response , leaders of hamas and abbas 's rival fatah faction agreed to work towards forming a " national unity " government on thursday , feb .
26 , and to hold fresh elections soon . us secretary of state hillary clinton , who was making her first appearance at such a large-scale conference in her new role , reassured delegates on monday that the us was working with the palestinian authority to install " safeguards " to ensure that funding " is only used where and for whom it is intended " and " does not end up in the wrong hands . "
she also stressed that the response to the current gaza crisis " can not be separated " from broader peace efforts , adding that aid to gaza could " foster conditions in which a palestinian state can be fully realized . "
neither israel nor hamas were present at the conference .
israel said it supported efforts to help palestinians in the strip , but wanted assurances the aid money would not reach hamas militants .
" we definitely do n't want to see the goodwill of the international community exploited by hamas and serve hamas ' extremist purposes , " said mark regev , a spokesman for prime minister ehud olmert .
more than 1,300 palestinians were killed and thousands of gaza homes and government buildings were reduced to rubble during the israeli offensive .
thirteen israelis also died in attacks by hamas militants . dfm / jg / nda / th / reuters / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has taught us one thing .
political principles that seemed unshakeable just a few weeks ago no longer apply .
and no one can predict with certainty what action will be needed to avert catastrophe in the weeks ahead .
the explicit " no " to a rescue plan for the ailing economies of eastern europe may also not stand the test of time .
german chancellor angela merkel and czech prime minster mirek topolanek whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , are currently resisting calls for eu cash injections for hungary , latvia , romania , bulgaria et al .

or could some eu states really be at risk of bankruptcy in the near future because they can not afford private sector loans ?
as recently as december , many eastern european governments were maintaining that they had not been hit by the financial crisis .
now , they are standing at the edge of the abyss . and things continue to develop apace .
there are already signs that the financial crisis could also endanger the euro , which is used by 16 eu states .
the euro is already feeling the pinch on the currency markets .
eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquín almunia has warned about the danger of the flight of capital .
ireland , greece , spain and italy are finding it increasingly difficult to find buyers for their government bonds .
germany , one of the biggest and strongest eu economies , balks at having to step in and prop up other member states because it would mean that it would also have to increase the interest rates on its own government bonds to attract buyers .
eu leaders did not come up with any answers to these particular questions at their hastily convened summit meetings .
however , state representatives were at least united in speaking out against protectionism .
they were adamant that the single market must continue to function and that no countries should go it alone .
that is a good thing .

eu members also agree that there is a need to tighten regulation and oversight for banks .
they intend to co-ordinate the states ' rescue plans and economic stimulus programs .
the bloc is also making progress on the issue of how to deal with the problem of the worthless - so-called toxic - assets held by european banks .

the defense minister says the move will create jobs , but some say there are better uses for a stimulus money . over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 634 million -rrb- of the federal 50-billion-euro package have been earmarked for the military , according to the german ministry of defense .
more than 250 million euros will go toward renovating existing and constructing new facilities , including barracks and other buildings .
the german military " is an important source of contracts for the german economy , so it only makes sense that it will make the most of the possibilities to continue its support in the context of the economic stimulus package , " said german defense minister franz-josef jung in a statement .
jung added that the defense ministry 's plans to spend the funds would not only support small and mid-sized german businesses , but would also help protect the lives of its soldiers .
modern military gear an additional 250 million euros are to be invested in high-tech military equipment .
according to the defense ministry , " dingo " patrol vehicles would be purchased for use on foreign deployments and new " seafox " drones would quickly make underwater mine detection without human divers a reality .
according to a report published on sunday , march 1 , by the financial times web site , 1,000 heckler & koch sub-machine guns and 10 armored fenneck reconnaissance vehicles were also on the list .
heckler & koch is a german company , while fennecks are made by a german-dutch conglomerate .
" it is bogus to claim the purchase of tanks and combat drones represents an economic stimulus program , " said left party parliamentarian inge hoege , as quoted by the financial times .
berlin 's second stimulus package was approved by parliament last month .
it follows a 50 billion-euro aid package from november 2008 .
currently , 7,300 german troops are deployed abroad on missions in afghanistan , the balkans , africa , and elsewhere . kjb / th / ap / ft send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .

" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "
the specter of a new iron curtain was raised at the start of the talks by hungary 's premier ferenc gyurcsany . " in the beginning of the 1990s , we reunified europe .
now the challenge is to reunify europe financially : we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe „ said gyurcsany , whose cash-strapped country has required an international bail-out .
in their joint statement , leaders agreed to allay such concerns by acknowledging " clear differences between the member states in central and eastern europe " , rather than along an east-west divide .

topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .

but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "

while poland and slovakia are in sound financial shape , expecting modest economic growth this year , hungary and latvia have already been forced to look for rescue from international institutions . leaders reject talk of divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's heavy hitters rejected talk of a split in the bloc sunday 's summit was called by the czech presidency in a bid to shore up unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that it may risk breaking into splinter groups .
topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .
and hungarian calls for the creation of a 190-billion-euro -lrb- $ 240-billion -rrb- crisis fund for the whole region were dismissed by the eu 's richest nation , with german chancellor angela merkel saying : " the situation is very different .
we can not compare slovakia or slovenia with hungary . "
as philip white , senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform put it : " leaders are acutely aware of the parlous economic background , so they will bend over backwards to come out with soothing statements .
" the real problem is that a lot of leaders will be unable to live up to their rhetorical commitments , " white predicted . nda / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .
reading the fine print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top opel and gm executives have been presenting their restructuring plans the economics minister said the company 's restructuring plan first had to be examined in detail .
" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm echoed guttenberg 's sentiments .
he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .
wilhelm said the company 's business plan would first be checked by independent financial auditors to determine its sustainability .
cautious approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an onerous task for germany 's new finance minister guttenberg has been careful to avoid premature promises , telling germany 's ard television ahead of the meeting that the german government would conduct a " very far-reaching examination " of the company 's proposals to ensure that opel has " a truly viable perspective for the future . "
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .
a portion of the government bailout is likely to come from the state budgets .
some 25,000 people in germany are employed by opel . dfm / jg / kjb / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .
reading the fine print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top opel and gm executives have been presenting their restructuring plans the economics minister said the company 's restructuring plan first had to be examined in detail .
" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm echoed guttenberg 's sentiments .
he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .
wilhelm said the company 's business plan would first be checked by independent financial auditors to determine its sustainability .
cautious approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an onerous task for germany 's new finance minister guttenberg has been careful to avoid premature promises , telling germany 's ard television ahead of the meeting that the german government would conduct a " very far-reaching examination " of the company 's proposals to ensure that opel has " a truly viable perspective for the future . "
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .

germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .

" our first and indispensable goal , therefore , is to open crossings .
by the same token , however , it is therefore essential to ensure that illegal weapons do not enter gaza . "
" money is very important but it is not going to solve the problem unless there is pressure from the international community on israel to open all -lrb- border -rrb- crossings with gaza " said gasser abdel-razek , a spokesman for human rights group oxfam international .

without a majority , it may have to cede leadership for the first time since it got its own assembly 30 years ago . outgoing basque prime minister juan jose ibarretxe 's basque nationalist party -lrb- pnv -rrb- , which wants to loosen ties with spain , won the regional elections on sunday , march 1 , but did not achieve enough of a majority to govern in a coalition with its pro-separatist partners . the pnv came away with 30 seats in the 75-seat assembly , while the three basque nationalist parties claimed a total of 38 . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist party , on the other hand , could form a regional government if they enter into a coalition with the conservative people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- and the new party upd . the socialist party came away with 24 seats , up from 18 .
the pp took 13 seats and the upd one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibarretxe had campaigned for self-determination referendums the conservatives said they were willing to join such a coalition in order to end nationalist rule in the basque region , despite years of tension between the socialists and the pp on national level . voters tired of self-determination debate the electoral success of basque socialist party leader patxi lopez was considered to reflect voter fatigue with the ongoing separatist debate .
it was also seen as a boost for zapatero , whose support had suffered as a result of the country 's deepening recession . analysts had attributed the socialist party 's rise in popularity ahead of the vote to zapatero 's pledge to negotiate peace with the violent separatist group eta . however , an alliance between the socialists and the pp was expected to cost zapatero 's minority government the support of the pnv in the national parliament , which would force him to find new partners . a coalition between the socialists and pnv is also plausible , but unlikely , as lopez has clashed with ibarretxe over the latter 's pet project of holding self-determination referendums . a hefty blow to basque separatists spanish daily el mundo called the election result the opening of a " new era " for the troubled northern region of 2.1 million residents and a " great setback " for ibarretxe . granted regional autonomy in 1979 , the basque region has been governed by the pnv ever since . there would be " no more room in the basque parliament for sovereignty plans or ... complicity with terrorism , " commented the daily el pais . eta , which has been responsible for more than 820 deaths since 1968 , is not officially supported by any of the basque political parties .
but critics of basque nationalism have long accused nationalist politicians of being in cahoots with the terrorist group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the vote , the basque region is distancing itself from the militant separatist group eta last month , spain 's supreme court had banned two nationalist basque parties from participating in sunday 's election due to their ties to batasuna , the outlawed political wing of eta . conservatives regain power in galicia elections were also held in the north-western galicia region , where the pp was expected to form a government after getting an absolute majority . the conservatives will thus restore their traditional domination in galicia , after four years of rule by a coalition of socialists and galician nationalists . the galician result was seen as a blow to zapatero and as a boost to pp leader mariano rajoy , whose leadership had been questioned after two successive national election defeats and over corruption allegations affecting his party . kjb / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel said after an eu summit in brussels on sunday , march 1 , that the bloc " could consider " shortening the minimum two-year preparatory phase for euro membership .
" there are requests to join erm ii faster , " merkel said .
" we can have a look at that . "
the exchange rate mechanism ii currency grid , or erm ii , is an agreement to maintain stable exchange rates between the euro and the currency of the euro zone applicant state to avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations on the internal market .
euro candidates are expected to participate in erm ii for at least two years before adopting the euro .
hungary , poland and czech republic are among several states awaiting erm ii status .
estonia , lithuania and latvia , meanwhile , have been erm ii participants for a number of years but have so far been barred from taking up the euro .
french president nicolas sarkozy said " the debate is open " on whether applications to join the euro group could be sped up .

hungary and poland have floated the idea of speeding up their applications for euro zone membership to this effect .
" we have to accelerate the process of joining the euro zone , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany told journalists ahead of the brussels summit .
he agreed that euro candidates should adhere to the rigorous economic conditions for joining the bloc , but that the two-year erm ii waiting period was too long .
" we should not allow a new ' iron curtain ' to … divide europe into two parts , " he said , warning of the growing division between rich and poor countries because of the economic crisis .

german chancellor angela merkel said after an eu summit in brussels on sunday , march 1 , that the bloc " could consider " shortening the minimum two-year preparatory phase for euro membership .
" there are requests to join erm ii faster , " merkel said .
" we can have a look at that . "
the exchange rate mechanism ii currency grid , or erm ii , is an agreement to maintain stable exchange rates between the euro and the currency of the euro zone applicant state to avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations on the internal market .
euro candidates are expected to participate in erm ii for at least two years before adopting the euro .
hungary , poland and czech republic are among several states awaiting erm ii status .
estonia , lithuania and latvia , meanwhile , have been erm ii participants for a number of years but have so far been barred from taking up the euro .
french president nicolas sarkozy said " the debate is open " on whether applications to join the euro group could be sped up .
however the french leader backed away from supporting present-day exemptions to criteria for joining the bloc .
" in the future , when the crisis is over , we should look and see what we have learnt from the crisis … to see if we should integrate new criteria , " sarkozy said .

he agreed that euro candidates should adhere to the rigorous economic conditions for joining the bloc , but that the two-year erm ii waiting period was too long .
" we should not allow a new ' iron curtain ' to … divide europe into two parts , " he said , warning of the growing division between rich and poor countries because of the economic crisis .
" at the beginning of the 90s , we reunified europe .
now it is another challenge - whether we can unify europe in terms of financing and its economy , " he said .

" we said that we could have a discussion as to whether the rules are too soft in the times when the economy is booming and too strict in times when we are in more difficulty , " said topolanek , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he acknowledged however that quick changes to the rules were out of the question .

solution to downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany , left , and topolanek say economic conditions should be considered fast-tracked membership of the european single market is increasingly being seen by some eastern european states as a way of stabilizing their struggling economies , which have been hit hard by the global credit squeeze and economic downturn .
hungary and poland have floated the idea of speeding up their applications for euro zone membership to this effect .

" i do n't think that anybody who was there -lrb- at the summit -rrb- as a head of state or government accepted the idea of changing the rules at the moment . "
prospective euro candidates usually have to respect five economic conditions before adopting the currency .
they must keep deficits and debt down , their currencies stable , long-term interest rates in line with targets and inflation under control in a sustainable way . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2009 austria , hungary allowed to keep ban on genetically modified crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria and hungary have maintained their right to ban gm crops , for now germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , has voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize . eu environment ministers meeting in brussels on monday , march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow us biotech giant monsanto 's mon810 gm maize grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .
eu sources say that around 100 billion euros of that will need to be spent in developing countries . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2009 austria , hungary allowed to keep ban on genetically modified crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria and hungary have maintained their right to ban gm crops , for now germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , has voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize . eu environment ministers meeting in brussels on monday , march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow us biotech giant monsanto 's mon810 gm maize grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .
eu sources say that around 100 billion euros of that will need to be spent in developing countries . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .
reading the fine print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top opel and gm executives have been presenting their restructuring plans the economics minister said the company 's restructuring plan first had to be examined in detail .
" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm echoed guttenberg 's sentiments .
he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .
wilhelm said the company 's business plan would first be checked by independent financial auditors to determine its sustainability .
cautious approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an onerous task for germany 's new finance minister guttenberg has been careful to avoid premature promises , telling germany 's ard television ahead of the meeting that the german government would conduct a " very far-reaching examination " of the company 's proposals to ensure that opel has " a truly viable perspective for the future . "
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .
a portion of the government bailout is likely to come from the state budgets .
some 25,000 people in germany are employed by opel . dfm / jg / kjb / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2009 austria , hungary allowed to keep ban on genetically modified crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria and hungary have maintained their right to ban gm crops , for now germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , has voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize . eu environment ministers meeting in brussels on monday , march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow us biotech giant monsanto 's mon810 gm maize grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .
eu sources say that around 100 billion euros of that will need to be spent in developing countries . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .
reading the fine print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top opel and gm executives have been presenting their restructuring plans the economics minister said the company 's restructuring plan first had to be examined in detail .
" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm echoed guttenberg 's sentiments .
he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .
wilhelm said the company 's business plan would first be checked by independent financial auditors to determine its sustainability .
cautious approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an onerous task for germany 's new finance minister guttenberg has been careful to avoid premature promises , telling germany 's ard television ahead of the meeting that the german government would conduct a " very far-reaching examination " of the company 's proposals to ensure that opel has " a truly viable perspective for the future . "
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .
a portion of the government bailout is likely to come from the state budgets .

the explicit " no " to a rescue plan for the ailing economies of eastern europe may also not stand the test of time .
german chancellor angela merkel and czech prime minster mirek topolanek whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , are currently resisting calls for eu cash injections for hungary , latvia , romania , bulgaria et al .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's bernd riegert but is the hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany exaggerating when he says that eu member states in eastern europe need a support fund of up to 190 billion euros to restore solvency ?
or could some eu states really be at risk of bankruptcy in the near future because they can not afford private sector loans ?
as recently as december , many eastern european governments were maintaining that they had not been hit by the financial crisis .
now , they are standing at the edge of the abyss . and things continue to develop apace .
there are already signs that the financial crisis could also endanger the euro , which is used by 16 eu states .
the euro is already feeling the pinch on the currency markets .
eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquín almunia has warned about the danger of the flight of capital .
ireland , greece , spain and italy are finding it increasingly difficult to find buyers for their government bonds .
germany , one of the biggest and strongest eu economies , balks at having to step in and prop up other member states because it would mean that it would also have to increase the interest rates on its own government bonds to attract buyers .
eu leaders did not come up with any answers to these particular questions at their hastily convened summit meetings .
however , state representatives were at least united in speaking out against protectionism .
they were adamant that the single market must continue to function and that no countries should go it alone .
that is a good thing .
in the current financial situation any seizing up of the internal market would quickly lead the eu into rack and ruin .
eu members also agree that there is a need to tighten regulation and oversight for banks .
they intend to co-ordinate the states ' rescue plans and economic stimulus programs .
the bloc is also making progress on the issue of how to deal with the problem of the worthless - so-called toxic - assets held by european banks .
eu members have reached a consensus on the need to establish common standards .
they also agree that state debt , despite the burden of expensive stimulus programs , should not be allowed to spiral out of control .
this degree of unity would have been unthinkable just a few months ago . the europeans are being bounced into taking action by the force of events .
but the europeans must now make sure that they act resolutely at the summit of the world 's 20 most important economic powers on 2 april in london .
some of the problems being faced elsewhere put the difficulties faced by some european states into perspective , and threaten to overshadow them .
europe has to ensure that it remains competitive .
the impromptu summit in brussels has shown that the small eu member states are not prepared to be left out .
the meeting was a retort in kinds to last week 's meeting in berlin ahead of the g20 summit where only the major eu states .
but now is not the time for internal squabbling .

it has taught us one thing .
political principles that seemed unshakeable just a few weeks ago no longer apply .
and no one can predict with certainty what action will be needed to avert catastrophe in the weeks ahead .
the explicit " no " to a rescue plan for the ailing economies of eastern europe may also not stand the test of time .
german chancellor angela merkel and czech prime minster mirek topolanek whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , are currently resisting calls for eu cash injections for hungary , latvia , romania , bulgaria et al .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's bernd riegert but is the hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany exaggerating when he says that eu member states in eastern europe need a support fund of up to 190 billion euros to restore solvency ?
or could some eu states really be at risk of bankruptcy in the near future because they can not afford private sector loans ?
as recently as december , many eastern european governments were maintaining that they had not been hit by the financial crisis .
now , they are standing at the edge of the abyss . and things continue to develop apace .
there are already signs that the financial crisis could also endanger the euro , which is used by 16 eu states .
the euro is already feeling the pinch on the currency markets .
eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquín almunia has warned about the danger of the flight of capital .
ireland , greece , spain and italy are finding it increasingly difficult to find buyers for their government bonds .
germany , one of the biggest and strongest eu economies , balks at having to step in and prop up other member states because it would mean that it would also have to increase the interest rates on its own government bonds to attract buyers .
eu leaders did not come up with any answers to these particular questions at their hastily convened summit meetings .
however , state representatives were at least united in speaking out against protectionism .
they were adamant that the single market must continue to function and that no countries should go it alone .
that is a good thing .
in the current financial situation any seizing up of the internal market would quickly lead the eu into rack and ruin .
eu members also agree that there is a need to tighten regulation and oversight for banks .
they intend to co-ordinate the states ' rescue plans and economic stimulus programs .
the bloc is also making progress on the issue of how to deal with the problem of the worthless - so-called toxic - assets held by european banks .
eu members have reached a consensus on the need to establish common standards .
they also agree that state debt , despite the burden of expensive stimulus programs , should not be allowed to spiral out of control .
this degree of unity would have been unthinkable just a few months ago . the europeans are being bounced into taking action by the force of events .
but the europeans must now make sure that they act resolutely at the summit of the world 's 20 most important economic powers on 2 april in london .
some of the problems being faced elsewhere put the difficulties faced by some european states into perspective , and threaten to overshadow them .
europe has to ensure that it remains competitive .
the impromptu summit in brussels has shown that the small eu member states are not prepared to be left out .
the meeting was a retort in kinds to last week 's meeting in berlin ahead of the g20 summit where only the major eu states .
but now is not the time for internal squabbling .

but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "
the specter of a new iron curtain was raised at the start of the talks by hungary 's premier ferenc gyurcsany . " in the beginning of the 1990s , we reunified europe .
now the challenge is to reunify europe financially : we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe „ said gyurcsany , whose cash-strapped country has required an international bail-out .
in their joint statement , leaders agreed to allay such concerns by acknowledging " clear differences between the member states in central and eastern europe " , rather than along an east-west divide .
while poland and slovakia are in sound financial shape , expecting modest economic growth this year , hungary and latvia have already been forced to look for rescue from international institutions . leaders reject talk of divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's heavy hitters rejected talk of a split in the bloc sunday 's summit was called by the czech presidency in a bid to shore up unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that it may risk breaking into splinter groups .
topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .
and hungarian calls for the creation of a 190-billion-euro -lrb- $ 240-billion -rrb- crisis fund for the whole region were dismissed by the eu 's richest nation , with german chancellor angela merkel saying : " the situation is very different .
we can not compare slovakia or slovenia with hungary . "
as philip white , senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform put it : " leaders are acutely aware of the parlous economic background , so they will bend over backwards to come out with soothing statements .

but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "
the specter of a new iron curtain was raised at the start of the talks by hungary 's premier ferenc gyurcsany . " in the beginning of the 1990s , we reunified europe .
now the challenge is to reunify europe financially : we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe „ said gyurcsany , whose cash-strapped country has required an international bail-out .
in their joint statement , leaders agreed to allay such concerns by acknowledging " clear differences between the member states in central and eastern europe " , rather than along an east-west divide .
while poland and slovakia are in sound financial shape , expecting modest economic growth this year , hungary and latvia have already been forced to look for rescue from international institutions . leaders reject talk of divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's heavy hitters rejected talk of a split in the bloc sunday 's summit was called by the czech presidency in a bid to shore up unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that it may risk breaking into splinter groups .
topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .
and hungarian calls for the creation of a 190-billion-euro -lrb- $ 240-billion -rrb- crisis fund for the whole region were dismissed by the eu 's richest nation , with german chancellor angela merkel saying : " the situation is very different .
we can not compare slovakia or slovenia with hungary . "
as philip white , senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform put it : " leaders are acutely aware of the parlous economic background , so they will bend over backwards to come out with soothing statements .
" the real problem is that a lot of leaders will be unable to live up to their rhetorical commitments , " white predicted . nda / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the donors also called for an immediate lifting of israel 's blockade of the battered coastal strip preventing all but vital aid from entering the area .
gaza has an estimated 1.4 million inhabitants .
" the status quo is of benefit to all the extremism .
it is time for us to speed up the agenda , " french president nicolas sarkozy told the conference at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
final figures from the conference show the eu has pledged $ 554 million , the us $ 900 million and gulf arab states $ 1.65 billion in aid for the palestinians .
germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .

the donors also called for an immediate lifting of israel 's blockade of the battered coastal strip preventing all but vital aid from entering the area .
gaza has an estimated 1.4 million inhabitants .
" the status quo is of benefit to all the extremism .
it is time for us to speed up the agenda , " french president nicolas sarkozy told the conference at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
final figures from the conference show the eu has pledged $ 554 million , the us $ 900 million and gulf arab states $ 1.65 billion in aid for the palestinians .
germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas had asked for some $ 2.8 billion , almost half of that to pay for the reconstruction of the gaza strip after israel 's offensive in late december and january .
" we are confronted with a serious dilemma , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told a final news conference .
" will we once again reconstruct something we built a few years ago and now has been hammered and flattened ?
" many donors , despite pledges , will wish to see political progress before they commit to infrastructure reconstruction , " he said .
norway and egypt jointly presided over the conference .
gaza remains sealed off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between egypt and gaza also remains closed but the united nations and aid agencies have said that rebuilding the coastal enclave would be extremely difficult as long as border crossings into gaza remain closed . " the situation at the border crossings is intolerable .

the donors also called for an immediate lifting of israel 's blockade of the battered coastal strip preventing all but vital aid from entering the area .
gaza has an estimated 1.4 million inhabitants .
" the status quo is of benefit to all the extremism .
it is time for us to speed up the agenda , " french president nicolas sarkozy told the conference at the egyptian red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh .
final figures from the conference show the eu has pledged $ 554 million , the us $ 900 million and gulf arab states $ 1.65 billion in aid for the palestinians .
germany will reportedly pledge an extra $ 126 million on top of its contribution to the eu aid package .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas had asked for some $ 2.8 billion , almost half of that to pay for the reconstruction of the gaza strip after israel 's offensive in late december and january .
" we are confronted with a serious dilemma , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told a final news conference .
" will we once again reconstruct something we built a few years ago and now has been hammered and flattened ?
" many donors , despite pledges , will wish to see political progress before they commit to infrastructure reconstruction , " he said .
norway and egypt jointly presided over the conference .
gaza remains sealed off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between egypt and gaza also remains closed but the united nations and aid agencies have said that rebuilding the coastal enclave would be extremely difficult as long as border crossings into gaza remain closed .

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .
how much and how this will happen still needs to be discussed , " forster said .
reading the fine print bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top opel and gm executives have been presenting their restructuring plans the economics minister said the company 's restructuring plan first had to be examined in detail .
" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm echoed guttenberg 's sentiments .
he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .
wilhelm said the company 's business plan would first be checked by independent financial auditors to determine its sustainability .
cautious approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's an onerous task for germany 's new finance minister guttenberg has been careful to avoid premature promises , telling germany 's ard television ahead of the meeting that the german government would conduct a " very far-reaching examination " of the company 's proposals to ensure that opel has " a truly viable perspective for the future . "
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .
a portion of the government bailout is likely to come from the state budgets .
some 25,000 people in germany are employed by opel . dfm / jg / kjb / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
opel 's ceo , hans demant , and the head of the europe division of parent company general motors , carl-peter forster , were in berlin to make a case for the bailout forster said that the company needed 3.3 billion euros -lrb- 4.2 billion dollars -rrb- europe-wide to survive .
" we are agreed that we will ask other countries , in which we have significant activities , to contribute to this financing requirement .

" we will examine , we will evaluate and on the basis of this evaluation we will work out whether a further government decision is required , " guttenberg said .
guttenberg said that he would clear up any unanswered questions with opel 's parent company gm and the us government during a trip to the united states in march .

he said that opel was subject to the same procedures as other firms looking for state assistance .

"
german chancellor angela merkel has also been cautious , on saturday reminding fellow party members at a christian democratic union meeting that there were " clear rules " governing state aid .
berlin has already stipulated that no state aid would be allowed to flow into the coffers of its us-based parent company gm in detroit .
a spokesman for the german government said monday that another major concern for berlin was ensuring that german taxpayers ' money did not got towards saving jobs in the us .
job cuts likely even with a boost from berlin , it 's likely that gm will be forced to strike thousands of jobs across europe , according to media reports .
germany 's daily leipziger volkszeitung said up to 8,000 of the conglomerate 's 50,000 jobs in europe were in jeopardy , while the sueddeutsche zeitung put the number of endangered positions at 11,000 .
guttenberg has said he plans to meet with the economics ministers of the four german states where opel plants are located : north rhine-westphalia , rhineland palatinate , hesse and thuringia .

only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .
eu sources say that around 100 billion euros of that will need to be spent in developing countries . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .
eu sources say that around 100 billion euros of that will need to be spent in developing countries . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2009 austria , hungary allowed to keep ban on genetically modified crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria and hungary have maintained their right to ban gm crops , for now germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , has voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize . eu environment ministers meeting in brussels on monday , march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow us biotech giant monsanto 's mon810 gm maize grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .
eu sources say that around 100 billion euros of that will need to be spent in developing countries . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was also seen as a boost for zapatero , whose support had suffered as a result of the country 's deepening recession . analysts had attributed the socialist party 's rise in popularity ahead of the vote to zapatero 's pledge to negotiate peace with the violent separatist group eta . however , an alliance between the socialists and the pp was expected to cost zapatero 's minority government the support of the pnv in the national parliament , which would force him to find new partners . a coalition between the socialists and pnv is also plausible , but unlikely , as lopez has clashed with ibarretxe over the latter 's pet project of holding self-determination referendums . a hefty blow to basque separatists spanish daily el mundo called the election result the opening of a " new era " for the troubled northern region of 2.1 million residents and a " great setback " for ibarretxe . granted regional autonomy in 1979 , the basque region has been governed by the pnv ever since . there would be " no more room in the basque parliament for sovereignty plans or ... complicity with terrorism , " commented the daily el pais . eta , which has been responsible for more than 820 deaths since 1968 , is not officially supported by any of the basque political parties .
but critics of basque nationalism have long accused nationalist politicians of being in cahoots with the terrorist group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the vote , the basque region is distancing itself from the militant separatist group eta last month , spain 's supreme court had banned two nationalist basque parties from participating in sunday 's election due to their ties to batasuna , the outlawed political wing of eta . conservatives regain power in galicia elections were also held in the north-western galicia region , where the pp was expected to form a government after getting an absolute majority . the conservatives will thus restore their traditional domination in galicia , after four years of rule by a coalition of socialists and galician nationalists . the galician result was seen as a blow to zapatero and as a boost to pp leader mariano rajoy , whose leadership had been questioned after two successive national election defeats and over corruption allegations affecting his party . kjb / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel said after an eu summit in brussels on sunday , march 1 , that the bloc " could consider " shortening the minimum two-year preparatory phase for euro membership .
" there are requests to join erm ii faster , " merkel said .
" we can have a look at that . "
the exchange rate mechanism ii currency grid , or erm ii , is an agreement to maintain stable exchange rates between the euro and the currency of the euro zone applicant state to avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations on the internal market .
euro candidates are expected to participate in erm ii for at least two years before adopting the euro .
hungary , poland and czech republic are among several states awaiting erm ii status .
estonia , lithuania and latvia , meanwhile , have been erm ii participants for a number of years but have so far been barred from taking up the euro .
french president nicolas sarkozy said " the debate is open " on whether applications to join the euro group could be sped up .
however the french leader backed away from supporting present-day exemptions to criteria for joining the bloc .
" in the future , when the crisis is over , we should look and see what we have learnt from the crisis … to see if we should integrate new criteria , " sarkozy said .

hungary and poland have floated the idea of speeding up their applications for euro zone membership to this effect .
" we have to accelerate the process of joining the euro zone , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany told journalists ahead of the brussels summit .
he agreed that euro candidates should adhere to the rigorous economic conditions for joining the bloc , but that the two-year erm ii waiting period was too long .
" we should not allow a new ' iron curtain ' to … divide europe into two parts , " he said , warning of the growing division between rich and poor countries because of the economic crisis .
" at the beginning of the 90s , we reunified europe .
now it is another challenge - whether we can unify europe in terms of financing and its economy , " he said .

" we said that we could have a discussion as to whether the rules are too soft in the times when the economy is booming and too strict in times when we are in more difficulty , " said topolanek , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he acknowledged however that quick changes to the rules were out of the question .

if found guilty for negligence , dieter althaus could face one year in prison . austrian officials have charged althaus , the german state premier of thuringia , with manslaughter by negligence .
althaus had submitted written testimony in which he " assumed responsibility for the death of beata christandl , " a prosecutor in the austrian town of leoben said monday , march 2 .
christandl , 41 , died shortly after colliding with althaus on a slope in the province of styria .
campaign plans unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : althaus allegedly entered the slope against the direction of traffic the indictment comes six months before state elections in thuringia , for which althaus is to campaign as the leading candidate of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
he has not come back to work since the crash , in which he received severe injuries .
" this charge does not come as a surprise , " thuringia 's social minister christine lieberknecht told the mitteldeutschen zeitung on monday .
lieberknecht said she expected althaus to campaign for the august election despite the charges .
althaus not back to work the prosecution alleges that the politician had entered onto a slope against the direction of traffic shortly before crashing into the slovakia-born woman , who later died of severe head injuries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2009 austria , hungary allowed to keep ban on genetically modified crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria and hungary have maintained their right to ban gm crops , for now germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , has voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize . eu environment ministers meeting in brussels on monday , march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow us biotech giant monsanto 's mon810 gm maize grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .

only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 02.03.2009 austria , hungary allowed to keep ban on genetically modified crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria and hungary have maintained their right to ban gm crops , for now germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , has voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize . eu environment ministers meeting in brussels on monday , march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow us biotech giant monsanto 's mon810 gm maize grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
the outcome of the vote reaffirmed austria 's and hungary 's assertion that it is their sovereign right to prohibit gm crops , austria 's environment minister nikolaus berlakovich told a news conference after the vote .
" we have completely prevailed , " he said .
" this is for me as if austria won the european football championship . "
legal , but controversial under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
commission unperturbed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is already legal in the european union the " no " vote by the overwhelming majority of eu states is unlikely to put a stop to the commission 's efforts to have the austrian and hungarian bans quashed .
a commission spokeswoman said monday that the eu executive " notes the vote of the member states , " but would nonetheless push on with its effort to force austria and hungary to accept monsanto 's gm maize .
" we ca n't drop it , " she said .
" we are now in a position to either come forward with the same proposal , change the proposal - but we need reasons to do so - or change the procedure in and of itself .
" you can invoke the precaution principal , but you have to prove it at some point . "
" no social value " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said after the vote monday that it remained to be seen why the commission would continue its fight to have the gmo bans lifted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel says the commission has shown too much support for monsanto " i can not imagine that a us government would be so engaged for a european company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the commission is engaged for an american company , " he said .
" i ca n't see any increase in social value through the products of monsanto , " he said , adding that monsanto 's genetically modified seeds made farmers dependent on the company .
but european biotech association europabio said the vote was a " political side-step . "
the group added that it was incomprehensible that some eu countries were ignoring scientific evidence on the safety of the two gm maize varieties .
climate change aid eu environment ministers also discussed monday how to raise the billions of euros needed to help poorer countries deal with the adverse effects of climate change .
the ministers said however that it was too early to set an exact figure on the aid the eu would give poor nations in exchange for their help in fighting global warming .
talks to find a successor pact to the kyoto protocol will be held in copenhagen in december , but success in reaching a new environmental accord rests on convincing developing nations to help fight global warming , which they say has been caused by industrialized nations .
a recent version of a document detailing the eu 's stance in global talks estimates that net global incremental investment in fighting climate change needs to increase to around 175 billion euros -lrb- $ 220.4 billion -rrb- by 2020 , news agency reuters reported monday .
eu sources say that around 100 billion euros of that will need to be spent in developing countries . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.03.2009 eu leaders signal possible fast-tracks in euro membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several eu states want faster euro zone membership the leaders of several euro zone member states have given tacit signals that applications to join the single-currency bloc could be expedited as the financial crisis rolls on . the leaders said however that stringent criteria for taking up the euro would not be relaxed , despite the gloomy economic conditions pressuring applicant-states .
german chancellor angela merkel said after an eu summit in brussels on sunday , march 1 , that the bloc " could consider " shortening the minimum two-year preparatory phase for euro membership .
" there are requests to join erm ii faster , " merkel said .
" we can have a look at that . "
the exchange rate mechanism ii currency grid , or erm ii , is an agreement to maintain stable exchange rates between the euro and the currency of the euro zone applicant state to avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations on the internal market .
euro candidates are expected to participate in erm ii for at least two years before adopting the euro .
hungary , poland and czech republic are among several states awaiting erm ii status .
estonia , lithuania and latvia , meanwhile , have been erm ii participants for a number of years but have so far been barred from taking up the euro .
french president nicolas sarkozy said " the debate is open " on whether applications to join the euro group could be sped up .
however the french leader backed away from supporting present-day exemptions to criteria for joining the bloc .
" in the future , when the crisis is over , we should look and see what we have learnt from the crisis … to see if we should integrate new criteria , " sarkozy said .
solution to downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany , left , and topolanek say economic conditions should be considered fast-tracked membership of the european single market is increasingly being seen by some eastern european states as a way of stabilizing their struggling economies , which have been hit hard by the global credit squeeze and economic downturn .
hungary and poland have floated the idea of speeding up their applications for euro zone membership to this effect .
" we have to accelerate the process of joining the euro zone , " hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany told journalists ahead of the brussels summit .
he agreed that euro candidates should adhere to the rigorous economic conditions for joining the bloc , but that the two-year erm ii waiting period was too long .
" we should not allow a new ' iron curtain ' to … divide europe into two parts , " he said , warning of the growing division between rich and poor countries because of the economic crisis .
" at the beginning of the 90s , we reunified europe .
now it is another challenge - whether we can unify europe in terms of financing and its economy , " he said .
economic conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick announced a multi-billion-euro aid package for eastern european banks czech prime minister mirek topolanek said leaders at the summit agreed to the possibility of a discussion on whether the euro accession rulebook needed to take better consideration of economic conditions .
" we said that we could have a discussion as to whether the rules are too soft in the times when the economy is booming and too strict in times when we are in more difficulty , " said topolanek , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he acknowledged however that quick changes to the rules were out of the question .
" i do n't think that anybody who was there -lrb- at the summit -rrb- as a head of state or government accepted the idea of changing the rules at the moment . "
prospective euro candidates usually have to respect five economic conditions before adopting the currency .
they must keep deficits and debt down , their currencies stable , long-term interest rates in line with targets and inflation under control in a sustainable way . dfm / th / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has taught us one thing .
political principles that seemed unshakeable just a few weeks ago no longer apply .
and no one can predict with certainty what action will be needed to avert catastrophe in the weeks ahead .
the explicit " no " to a rescue plan for the ailing economies of eastern europe may also not stand the test of time .
german chancellor angela merkel and czech prime minster mirek topolanek whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , are currently resisting calls for eu cash injections for hungary , latvia , romania , bulgaria et al .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's bernd riegert but is the hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany exaggerating when he says that eu member states in eastern europe need a support fund of up to 190 billion euros to restore solvency ?
or could some eu states really be at risk of bankruptcy in the near future because they can not afford private sector loans ?
as recently as december , many eastern european governments were maintaining that they had not been hit by the financial crisis .
now , they are standing at the edge of the abyss . and things continue to develop apace .
there are already signs that the financial crisis could also endanger the euro , which is used by 16 eu states .
the euro is already feeling the pinch on the currency markets .
eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquín almunia has warned about the danger of the flight of capital .
ireland , greece , spain and italy are finding it increasingly difficult to find buyers for their government bonds .
germany , one of the biggest and strongest eu economies , balks at having to step in and prop up other member states because it would mean that it would also have to increase the interest rates on its own government bonds to attract buyers .
eu leaders did not come up with any answers to these particular questions at their hastily convened summit meetings .
however , state representatives were at least united in speaking out against protectionism .
they were adamant that the single market must continue to function and that no countries should go it alone .
that is a good thing .
in the current financial situation any seizing up of the internal market would quickly lead the eu into rack and ruin .
eu members also agree that there is a need to tighten regulation and oversight for banks .
they intend to co-ordinate the states ' rescue plans and economic stimulus programs .
the bloc is also making progress on the issue of how to deal with the problem of the worthless - so-called toxic - assets held by european banks .
eu members have reached a consensus on the need to establish common standards .
they also agree that state debt , despite the burden of expensive stimulus programs , should not be allowed to spiral out of control .
this degree of unity would have been unthinkable just a few months ago . the europeans are being bounced into taking action by the force of events .
but the europeans must now make sure that they act resolutely at the summit of the world 's 20 most important economic powers on 2 april in london .
some of the problems being faced elsewhere put the difficulties faced by some european states into perspective , and threaten to overshadow them .
europe has to ensure that it remains competitive .
the impromptu summit in brussels has shown that the small eu member states are not prepared to be left out .
the meeting was a retort in kinds to last week 's meeting in berlin ahead of the g20 summit where only the major eu states .
but now is not the time for internal squabbling .
this crisis is far too serious for that . bernd riegert / jg / nda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but beneath the surface , serious cracks remain . a huge map of europe , sliced in half by the communist-era iron curtain , looms over the entrance of the building in brussels where european union leaders regularly meet . twenty years after the collapse of the berlin wall lifted millions of europeans out of economic misery , the main task of sunday 's emergency summit was to prevent the creation of a new financial barrier dividing the continent 's east and west .
all the comments after the summit were of constructive debate and a passion for unity .
the message was clear : the eu is still a union ; its greatest achievement , the single market , remains a bastion against protectionism ; and alleged divisions along geographical fault lines are just media hype .
" in the media it looked as if we had very different views , but in the discussions we very much agreed , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who chaired the talks as the current eu president .
in a two-and-half-page joint statement , leaders " agreed that europe can only face this challenge and overcome the current crisis by continuing to act together in a coordinated manner . "
they also reached an initial agreement on the disposal of toxic assets and " expressed confidence in the medium and long term outlook of all eu economies " , despite what many describe as the world 's worst economic downturn since world war ii .
strain evident behind the platitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's pm gyurcsany , left , with czech pm topolanek look beyond the platitudes , however , and it is clear that deep divisions remain .
the eu may not be about to break up , but even topolanek could do little to disguise the fact that it is under severe strain .
" it was very necessary to have this discussion , so as to ensure we are all on the same wavelength and show that we all respect the rules , " topolanek said when asked why he had convened the meeting .
but as piotr kaczynksi , an analyst at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- told the dpa press agency ahead of the talks : " confirmation of the unity of the single market should never be necessary . "
the specter of a new iron curtain was raised at the start of the talks by hungary 's premier ferenc gyurcsany . " in the beginning of the 1990s , we reunified europe .
now the challenge is to reunify europe financially : we should not allow a new iron curtain to be set up and divide europe „ said gyurcsany , whose cash-strapped country has required an international bail-out .
in their joint statement , leaders agreed to allay such concerns by acknowledging " clear differences between the member states in central and eastern europe " , rather than along an east-west divide .
while poland and slovakia are in sound financial shape , expecting modest economic growth this year , hungary and latvia have already been forced to look for rescue from international institutions . leaders reject talk of divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's heavy hitters rejected talk of a split in the bloc sunday 's summit was called by the czech presidency in a bid to shore up unity in the midst of a damaging row over protectionism and fears that it may risk breaking into splinter groups .
topolanek later insisted that the " idea of divisions between new and old member states , north against south or east against west " had been " clearly rejected " by heads of state and government .
but while the leaders avoided a public fight on sunday , they did little to dispel the fears which their previous actions had raised .
french president nicolas sarkozy , who earlier outraged colleagues by calling for special treatment for french carmakers , set up a future row by demanding that the bloc bring in similar measures on a europe-wide scale .
attempts to soothe the feelings of a clutch of member states outraged by their exclusion from an elite group of eu countries preparing a summit of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading economies in london failed when finnish premier matti vanhanen vowed to push for an explanation among eu foreign ministers .
and hungarian calls for the creation of a 190-billion-euro -lrb- $ 240-billion -rrb- crisis fund for the whole region were dismissed by the eu 's richest nation , with german chancellor angela merkel saying : " the situation is very different .
we can not compare slovakia or slovenia with hungary . "
as philip white , senior research fellow at the london-based centre for european reform put it : " leaders are acutely aware of the parlous economic background , so they will bend over backwards to come out with soothing statements .
" the real problem is that a lot of leaders will be unable to live up to their rhetorical commitments , " white predicted . nda / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than a third of local councils have uncovered some level of fraudulent pupil applications over recent years .
parents have been found using the address of a relative living in the desired catchment area , or a second or rented home where they did not live .
the information was uncovered by bbc wales ' eye on wales programme following a freedom of information request .
in caerphilly , there were 30 such applications each year over a three-year period .
in most cases , councils had refused the applications or they were withdrawn by parents .
i think this shows how important -lsb- this is -rsb- , and what lengths some people will go to , to try and get themselves into the school of their choice prof david egan , uwic parents are entitled to apply for any school they wish for their child , but some , particularly in urban areas , or welsh-medium schools , are over-subscribed .
education authorities set their own admissions criteria for deciding who gets spare places over and above the children living in the catchment area .
in some heavily subscribed areas , even children living within the catchment may not get a place .
professor david egan , director of the centre for applied education research at uwic , in cardiff , told the programme people usually chose the local community school they wanted their children to attend , or picked welsh medium or faith schools which were available in the area if they preferred that type of education .
however he added : " but then you move to cardiff , obviously , or to swansea - certainly into the two major cities of wales - inevitably , where there are a range of schools , where there are highly-performing schools , and schools that are in challenging circumstances , where performance is not as strong , then these issues will kick in . "

" but i think this shows how important -lsb- this is -rsb- , and what lengths some people will go to , to try and get themselves into the school of their choice .
" often , they may have moved into the area , they may have bought a house in an area almost with an expectation that they felt they could get to their desired school , and clearly that does n't always happen because obviously , when a school is full , those criteria kick in again which can actually sometimes discriminate against children who live right next-door to the school . "
cardiff high school is one of wales ' oversubscribed schools , with approximately 270 applications per year for 210 new pupil intake places .
head teacher mike griffiths said half of the 60 who did not receive a place would appeal against the decision .
he said applications were gone through " in minute detail , because obviously they need total convincing … you have to prove it 's your main residence . "

media requires javascript to play .
welsh local councils have £ 625m in cash reserves with large variations between authorities .
welsh local councils have £ 625m in cash reserves with large variations between authorities , bbc wales has learned .
savings are kept for future projects and to cope with emergencies .
gwynedd had the highest proportion of cash reserves compared to the total budget : just under £ 48m out of a budget last year of more than £ 198m , or 24 % .
councils said they were bringing forward spending on projects to help counter the recession and they had to prepare for cutbacks in their funding .
gwynedd is planning to spend £ 37m from its reserves on specific projects in the future , while keeping £ 11m for emergencies .
freedom of information -lrb- foi -rrb- requests made by bbc wales uncovered other local authorities with high levels of reserves compared with their total budget .
i think it would be a bit dangerous , at this particular stage , for us to be micro-managing the finances of individual local authorities local government minister brian gibbons carmarthenshire , denbighshire and pembrokeshire had 18 % of their annual budget in reserves and neath port talbot , blaenau gwent and newport 17 % .
bridgend and caerphilly had the lowest , around 7 % .
the welsh assembly government , which provides local councils with most of their funding , is itself holding only 1 % in cash reserves this year .
critics , including wrexham am leslie griffiths , said no councils should be sitting on large cash reserves during a recession , when spending them could help stimulate the economy .
she called on the auditor general to consider whether local authorities should have guidelines on their level of reserves and argued that the assembly government might need to issue advice on the matter .
welsh council reserves anglesey : £ 17.4m - 15.2 % of total budget blaenau gwent : £ 20.6m - 17.7 % bridgend : £ 14.2m - 7.1 % caerphilly : £ 16.4m - 6.8 % cardiff : £ 36.4m - 8.1 % carmarthenshire : £ 52.5m - 18.7 % ceredigion : £ 17.8m - 15.7 % conwy : £ 14.2m - 8.4 % denbighshire : £ 29m - 18.6 % flintshire : £ 28.2m - 13.5 % gwynedd : £ 47.7m - 24 % merthyr tydfil : £ 9.4m - 9.9 % monmouthshire : £ 18m - 14.6 % neath port talbot : £ 38.5m - 17.1 % newport : £ 37.3m - 17.2 % pembrokeshire : £ 34.8m - 18.8 % powys : £ 30.5m - 14.2 % rhondda cynon taf : £ 47.3m - 12.5 % swansea : £ 49.8m - 14.5 % torfaen : £ 16.2m - 11.1 % vale of glamorgan : £ 20.8m - 11.7 % wrexham : £ 22.5m - 12.2 % source : bbc wales freedom of information inquiries .
pembrokeshire declined to provide the information and said it was in the public domain .
its figures are wlga assessments the assembly government agreed that there were large differences between how councils were handling the recession in their areas .
local government minister brian gibbons warned against telling councils how to spend their money .
" there is certainly professional guidance out there already through the accounting agencies and the finance officers of local authorities so , if they 're professional on the job , they know what makes economic sense for them , " he said .
" i think it would be a bit dangerous , at this particular stage , for us to be micro-managing the finances of individual local authorities , " dr gibbons added .
but ministers said that councils should bring forward spending on projects where possible , as the assembly and uk governments have .
' fundamentally flawed ' the welsh local government association -lrb- wlga -rrb- insisted this was already happening in many cases .
and it argued there were cutbacks of £ 500m projected for the assembly government 's budget and this would inevitably have an impact on local government finances .
wlga chief executive steve thomas said councils needed to prepare for this .
he said : " from our point of view , the reserves have been built up and are there because of statutory guidance from the wales office .
" they 'll be used to help people during the recession , but will also be phased-in during a period of time within communities .
" so we 've got to make sure we 've got a sustainable local government in wales in the next five to six years and it 's not all about spending reserves now and leaving the cupboard bare .
" the lessons of the last two years prove that strategy is fundamentally flawed . "
wlga leader cllr john davies said it was " incredulous " that councils were being questioned over their reserve levels " when it is these same reserves that will play such a vital role in ensuring financial risks can be managed " .
the federation of small businesses -lrb- fsb -rrb- said councils should use their surpluses to provide short-term loans to small businesses unable to get funding from banks .
they fsb said this would be an effective way of boosting the economy during the recession .

david miller 's design will feature on the permit in the first major makeover the licence has had in 140 years .
the carmarthenshire artist 's designs will replace the old fashioned paper version carried by anglers in the uk since the 1860s .
over one million of the credit card-sized licences will be distributed .
they have been designed to prevent identity theft .
the cards have fewer personal details on them and also have a barcode so bailiffs can verify them .
the environment agency said it expected to issue over one million of the waterproof cards from 2 march , making mr miller , a lifelong angler , the most widely distributed wildlife artist in the uk .
the new coarse fishing licence features a perch lunging for a baited hook , while the salmon licence shows a ray of light illuminating a silvery grey salmon under the water .
mr miller said : " i do feel honoured to have been chosen to provide the artwork for the new rod licence . "
he lives in a wooded valley near the taf and towy estuaries and paints mostly british wildlife , usually in oils .
the salmon licence shows a ray of light illuminating a silvery grey salmon internationally , his larger fish paintings now hang in boardrooms in london , tokyo and new york .
licence sales hit a 10-year high in 2008 , which the environment agency said showed a resurgence in interest in angling .
the cost of the licence ranges between £ 3.50 for one day of coarse fishing to £ 70 for a seasonal licence to fish for salmon .
andy schofield of the environment agency wales said : " the new-look rod licence will deliver real benefits to anglers .
" the system is now cheaper and quicker to administer - which allows us to spend more licence money on improving and protecting the fisheries of wales while keeping the increase in rod licence fees to a minimum . "
money raised from the sale of rod licences funds much of the agency 's fisheries service as well as supporting fishery projects including multi-ability access improvements , habitat restoration and community fisheries schemes .

david miller 's design will feature on the permit in the first major makeover the licence has had in 140 years .
the carmarthenshire artist 's designs will replace the old fashioned paper version carried by anglers in the uk since the 1860s .
over one million of the credit card-sized licences will be distributed .
they have been designed to prevent identity theft .
the cards have fewer personal details on them and also have a barcode so bailiffs can verify them .
the environment agency said it expected to issue over one million of the waterproof cards from 2 march , making mr miller , a lifelong angler , the most widely distributed wildlife artist in the uk .
the new coarse fishing licence features a perch lunging for a baited hook , while the salmon licence shows a ray of light illuminating a silvery grey salmon under the water .
mr miller said : " i do feel honoured to have been chosen to provide the artwork for the new rod licence . "
he lives in a wooded valley near the taf and towy estuaries and paints mostly british wildlife , usually in oils .
internationally , his larger fish paintings now hang in boardrooms in london , tokyo and new york .
licence sales hit a 10-year high in 2008 , which the environment agency said showed a resurgence in interest in angling .
the cost of the licence ranges between £ 3.50 for one day of coarse fishing to £ 70 for a seasonal licence to fish for salmon .
andy schofield of the environment agency wales said : " the new-look rod licence will deliver real benefits to anglers .
" the system is now cheaper and quicker to administer - which allows us to spend more licence money on improving and protecting the fisheries of wales while keeping the increase in rod licence fees to a minimum . "
money raised from the sale of rod licences funds much of the agency 's fisheries service as well as supporting fishery projects including multi-ability access improvements , habitat restoration and community fisheries schemes .

bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- q & a : bangladesh border guards mutiny bbc news / south asia graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 07:33 gmt , monday , 2 march 2009 q & a : bangladesh border guards mutiny bangladesh border guards have surrendered after their two-day mutiny in the capital , dhaka .
some 700 guards are in custody and a manhunt is on for 1,000 more " guards and accomplices " .
some 74 officers are thought to have died , along with 20 civilians .
here is a look at what led to the situation and its consequences .
who was behind the mutiny ?
the revolt started on wednesday at the headquarters of bangladesh rifles -lrb- bdr -rrb- in the pilkhana area of dhaka .
the bdr are a paramilitary force , officially part of the home ministry , responsible for bangladesh 's border security .
they also perform anti-smuggling work and are required to help civil and military authorities as directed by the government .
the bdr has 70,000 men stationed at 42 camps across the country , including 40,000 along the country 's 4,000km -lrb- 2,500-mile -rrb- border with india and burma .
why did the bdr mutiny ?
the mutineers want the bdr command and officers to be drawn from their own ranks rather than from the regular army - most bdr officers are seconded from the army for two to four years .
the mutineers also complained about pay and conditions .
the average bdr guard earns about $ 70 -lrb- £ 50 -rrb- a month , which is equivalent to the wages of a low-ranking government clerk .
" an ordinary guard does n't get decent pay or food and spends a lot of time living in harsh , remote areas , " a dhaka university professor told the afp news agency .
the mutiny was reportedly sparked off by the refusal of senior officers to consider more pay and better conditions for the troops .
what impact might the mutiny have on bangladeshi politics ?
prime minister sheikh hasina was sworn in at the start of the year after two years of an army-backed interim government .
the bdr mutineers were not thought to be asking for any political change .
in a televised address earlier on thursday , sheikh hasina promised the mutineers that her government would address their concerns over pay and working conditions .
but she also threatened " tough action " if they did not surrender their arms .
it seems that this message had the desired effect .
however , when the scale of the fatalities in the mutiny became clear , the government said it would punish anyone involved in the killings .
what are the consequences for bangladesh ?
bangladesh 's 37-year history has been a turbulent one , with many incidents of political turmoil and violence .
the country has a population of more than 140 million - 40 % of whom are below the poverty line - and it is dependent on foreign aid and investment .
there are fears that further political unrest could deter investors and donor countries .
current economic growth could miss its target of 6.5 % , partly due to the global financial crisis , but political instability could push it down even more , according to some economists .

some 700 guards are in custody and a manhunt is on for 1,000 more " guards and accomplices " .
some 74 officers are thought to have died , along with 20 civilians .
here is a look at what led to the situation and its consequences .
who was behind the mutiny ?
the revolt started on wednesday at the headquarters of bangladesh rifles -lrb- bdr -rrb- in the pilkhana area of dhaka .
the border guards released hostages taken during the mutiny the bdr are a paramilitary force , officially part of the home ministry , responsible for bangladesh 's border security .
they also perform anti-smuggling work and are required to help civil and military authorities as directed by the government .
the bdr has 70,000 men stationed at 42 camps across the country , including 40,000 along the country 's 4,000km -lrb- 2,500-mile -rrb- border with india and burma .
why did the bdr mutiny ?
the mutineers want the bdr command and officers to be drawn from their own ranks rather than from the regular army - most bdr officers are seconded from the army for two to four years .
the mutineers also complained about pay and conditions .
the average bdr guard earns about $ 70 -lrb- £ 50 -rrb- a month , which is equivalent to the wages of a low-ranking government clerk .
" an ordinary guard does n't get decent pay or food and spends a lot of time living in harsh , remote areas , " a dhaka university professor told the afp news agency .
the mutiny was reportedly sparked off by the refusal of senior officers to consider more pay and better conditions for the troops .
what impact might the mutiny have on bangladeshi politics ?
prime minister sheikh hasina was sworn in at the start of the year after two years of an army-backed interim government .
sheikh hasina promised to address concerns over pay and conditions the bdr mutineers were not thought to be asking for any political change .
in a televised address earlier on thursday , sheikh hasina promised the mutineers that her government would address their concerns over pay and working conditions .
but she also threatened " tough action " if they did not surrender their arms .
it seems that this message had the desired effect .
however , when the scale of the fatalities in the mutiny became clear , the government said it would punish anyone involved in the killings .
what are the consequences for bangladesh ?
bangladesh 's 37-year history has been a turbulent one , with many incidents of political turmoil and violence .
the country has a population of more than 140 million - 40 % of whom are below the poverty line - and it is dependent on foreign aid and investment .
there are fears that further political unrest could deter investors and donor countries .
current economic growth could miss its target of 6.5 % , partly due to the global financial crisis , but political instability could push it down even more , according to some economists .

some 700 guards are in custody and a manhunt is on for 1,000 more " guards and accomplices " .
some 74 officers are thought to have died , along with 20 civilians .
here is a look at what led to the situation and its consequences .
who was behind the mutiny ?
the revolt started on wednesday at the headquarters of bangladesh rifles -lrb- bdr -rrb- in the pilkhana area of dhaka .
the border guards released hostages taken during the mutiny the bdr are a paramilitary force , officially part of the home ministry , responsible for bangladesh 's border security .
they also perform anti-smuggling work and are required to help civil and military authorities as directed by the government .
the bdr has 70,000 men stationed at 42 camps across the country , including 40,000 along the country 's 4,000km -lrb- 2,500-mile -rrb- border with india and burma .
why did the bdr mutiny ?
the mutineers want the bdr command and officers to be drawn from their own ranks rather than from the regular army - most bdr officers are seconded from the army for two to four years .
the mutineers also complained about pay and conditions .
the average bdr guard earns about $ 70 -lrb- £ 50 -rrb- a month , which is equivalent to the wages of a low-ranking government clerk .
" an ordinary guard does n't get decent pay or food and spends a lot of time living in harsh , remote areas , " a dhaka university professor told the afp news agency .
the mutiny was reportedly sparked off by the refusal of senior officers to consider more pay and better conditions for the troops .
what impact might the mutiny have on bangladeshi politics ?
prime minister sheikh hasina was sworn in at the start of the year after two years of an army-backed interim government .
sheikh hasina promised to address concerns over pay and conditions the bdr mutineers were not thought to be asking for any political change .
in a televised address earlier on thursday , sheikh hasina promised the mutineers that her government would address their concerns over pay and working conditions .
but she also threatened " tough action " if they did not surrender their arms .
it seems that this message had the desired effect .
however , when the scale of the fatalities in the mutiny became clear , the government said it would punish anyone involved in the killings .
what are the consequences for bangladesh ?
bangladesh 's 37-year history has been a turbulent one , with many incidents of political turmoil and violence .
the country has a population of more than 140 million - 40 % of whom are below the poverty line - and it is dependent on foreign aid and investment .
there are fears that further political unrest could deter investors and donor countries .
current economic growth could miss its target of 6.5 % , partly due to the global financial crisis , but political instability could push it down even more , according to some economists .

advertisement inside the old gold souk in dubai by julia wheeler bbc news , dubai crisis is not a word that 's used in dubai 's old gold souk .
there is no over-reaction , no sense of permanent despair , but the traders are lamenting the fact that fewer people are buying their wares .
the tourists still come to see the sparkling goods brashly displayed in the window of shop after shop .
during the evening , the place continues to bustle until 10 o 'clock - it 's one of the main tourist attractions in the city however , people are not buying from the jewellers like they did before .
safe bet many of those whose shops stand squashed into the three or four streets of the souk , under its wooden roof , are second or even third-generation gold traders .
the strength of the dirham reduces european tourists ' spending power many are indian , but they have grown up in dubai and they have learned the gold trade from their fathers and their fathers ' fathers .
in commodity terms , the gold metal in the traders ' shops is worth over 30 % more than it was three months ago , as internationally it is being seen as a safe bet in difficult times .
for many asian residents , who prefer 24 carat pure gold for their family 's jewellery , gold remains a reliable haven .
tourists though are spending less .
when gold is cheap , it makes a good souvenir by which to remember dubai and arabia .
when it is expensive , photographs of the souk may have to suffice .
thanks to the economic crisis , many travellers have less money to spend in the first place .
and for tourists from europe , there is another problem - they are not getting so many dollar-pegged uae dirhams in exchange for their euros or sterling .
benefits of gold the world gold council 's regional office in dubai recently announced that for the uae as a whole , gold jewellery sales increased by 17 % last year to more than $ 3.7bn -lrb- £ 2.5bn -rrb- .
" investors around the world recognise the benefits of holding gold during this time of unprecedented global financial crisis , recession and the spectre of future inflation , " said the council 's ceo , aram shishmanian .
some of the traders remember the days of gold smuggling between the gulf and india , when profit on successful trips was huge dubai 's fragile economy " purchasers in many of the key gold markets understand gold 's intrinsic investment value and continue to buy , " he added .
however , this year 's figures are not expected to be so encouraging .
over the years , the traders have seen the gold price go up and they have seen it go down .
they have lived through buoyant and turbulent times in the gulf .
they have watched as people turn to gold for security and turn away when they think their money will earn them more elsewhere .
this downturn too , many of them feel , will pass .
some of them remember the days of gold smuggling between the gulf and india , when profit on successful trips was huge .
the margins on the gold jewellery they are selling today are far less impressive .

advertisement inside the old gold souk in dubai by julia wheeler bbc news , dubai crisis is not a word that 's used in dubai 's old gold souk .
there is no over-reaction , no sense of permanent despair , but the traders are lamenting the fact that fewer people are buying their wares .
the tourists still come to see the sparkling goods brashly displayed in the window of shop after shop .
during the evening , the place continues to bustle until 10 o 'clock - it 's one of the main tourist attractions in the city however , people are not buying from the jewellers like they did before .
safe bet many of those whose shops stand squashed into the three or four streets of the souk , under its wooden roof , are second or even third-generation gold traders .
the strength of the dirham reduces european tourists ' spending power many are indian , but they have grown up in dubai and they have learned the gold trade from their fathers and their fathers ' fathers .
in commodity terms , the gold metal in the traders ' shops is worth over 30 % more than it was three months ago , as internationally it is being seen as a safe bet in difficult times .
for many asian residents , who prefer 24 carat pure gold for their family 's jewellery , gold remains a reliable haven .
tourists though are spending less .
when gold is cheap , it makes a good souvenir by which to remember dubai and arabia .
when it is expensive , photographs of the souk may have to suffice .
thanks to the economic crisis , many travellers have less money to spend in the first place .
and for tourists from europe , there is another problem - they are not getting so many dollar-pegged uae dirhams in exchange for their euros or sterling .
benefits of gold the world gold council 's regional office in dubai recently announced that for the uae as a whole , gold jewellery sales increased by 17 % last year to more than $ 3.7bn -lrb- £ 2.5bn -rrb- .
" investors around the world recognise the benefits of holding gold during this time of unprecedented global financial crisis , recession and the spectre of future inflation , " said the council 's ceo , aram shishmanian .
some of the traders remember the days of gold smuggling between the gulf and india , when profit on successful trips was huge dubai 's fragile economy " purchasers in many of the key gold markets understand gold 's intrinsic investment value and continue to buy , " he added .
however , this year 's figures are not expected to be so encouraging .
over the years , the traders have seen the gold price go up and they have seen it go down .
they have lived through buoyant and turbulent times in the gulf .
they have watched as people turn to gold for security and turn away when they think their money will earn them more elsewhere .
this downturn too , many of them feel , will pass .
some of them remember the days of gold smuggling between the gulf and india , when profit on successful trips was huge .
the margins on the gold jewellery they are selling today are far less impressive .

inside mumbai 's famous crawford market .
by anna cunningham bbc news , mumbai crawford market , in the bustling heart of india 's financial capital mumbai , has been a city landmark since the mid-19th century .
it sells the same things today as it did in 1869 - fruit , vegetables , meat , spices and even live animals - but lately prices have been rising , and sales are down .
india is still projected to enjoy healthy economic growth in the coming year , but the global economic downturn has kicked in here .
it was the city 's original municipal market - named after the first commissioner , arthur crawford - and the first building with electric lighting .
down one narrow alleyway , perched high on a chair above crates over flowing with onions , potatoes and garlic , sits 58-year-old iqbal hussain , whose family has been selling and exporting for three generations .
" since last december we have not received any order from foreign vessels , " says .
" the recession has affected us , business is down 50 % . "
prudent shoppers until india relaxed its protectionist stance towards foreign trade in the 1990s , the stalls in crawford market 's warren of aisles were one of the few places in mumbai to stock overseas goods .
indian shoppers are traditionally prudent crowds still teem around the foreign sweets , chocolates and electrical items or the foreign fruits and vegetables that sit alongside local produce , such as the famous alphonso mango .
but baban dagdu gundaal , aged 65 , who has been working at crawford market for 40 years , says costs are rising .
" the prices have increased , we have to pass it on , " he says .
" but customers are not willing to pay . "
in november , the imf predicted india 's economy would grow by 6.3 % in 2009/10 , though that figure has now been revised downward , to 5.1 % .
this month , india 's government relaxed its tight public spending targets to protect itself from the fallout of the global slowdown .
but indian consumers , traditionally prudent , have become cautious .
department stores , supermarkets and shopping chains all complained of falling third-quarter sales last year , particularly in the run-up to the hindu festival of lights , diwali - normally a big spending time .
even spice sellers are feeling the pinch .
jabbar prajapati says the cost of saffron has rocketed from 60 rupees -lrb- £ 0.82 / $ 1.20 -rrb- per gram last year , to 300 rupees -lrb- £ 4 / $ 6 -rrb- per gram .
" people are not ready to buy at those prices , " he says .
but life in crawford market goes on .
customers haggle for a good price in corners of the market , out of the intense heat of the sun , traders ply their goods and foreign visitors admire the victorian architecture .

inside mumbai 's famous crawford market .
by anna cunningham bbc news , mumbai crawford market , in the bustling heart of india 's financial capital mumbai , has been a city landmark since the mid-19th century .
it sells the same things today as it did in 1869 - fruit , vegetables , meat , spices and even live animals - but lately prices have been rising , and sales are down .
india is still projected to enjoy healthy economic growth in the coming year , but the global economic downturn has kicked in here .
it was the city 's original municipal market - named after the first commissioner , arthur crawford - and the first building with electric lighting .
down one narrow alleyway , perched high on a chair above crates over flowing with onions , potatoes and garlic , sits 58-year-old iqbal hussain , whose family has been selling and exporting for three generations .
" since last december we have not received any order from foreign vessels , " says .
" the recession has affected us , business is down 50 % . "
prudent shoppers until india relaxed its protectionist stance towards foreign trade in the 1990s , the stalls in crawford market 's warren of aisles were one of the few places in mumbai to stock overseas goods .
indian shoppers are traditionally prudent crowds still teem around the foreign sweets , chocolates and electrical items or the foreign fruits and vegetables that sit alongside local produce , such as the famous alphonso mango .
but baban dagdu gundaal , aged 65 , who has been working at crawford market for 40 years , says costs are rising .
" the prices have increased , we have to pass it on , " he says .
" but customers are not willing to pay . "
in november , the imf predicted india 's economy would grow by 6.3 % in 2009/10 , though that figure has now been revised downward , to 5.1 % .
this month , india 's government relaxed its tight public spending targets to protect itself from the fallout of the global slowdown .
but indian consumers , traditionally prudent , have become cautious .
department stores , supermarkets and shopping chains all complained of falling third-quarter sales last year , particularly in the run-up to the hindu festival of lights , diwali - normally a big spending time .
even spice sellers are feeling the pinch .
jabbar prajapati says the cost of saffron has rocketed from 60 rupees -lrb- £ 0.82 / $ 1.20 -rrb- per gram last year , to 300 rupees -lrb- £ 4 / $ 6 -rrb- per gram .
" people are not ready to buy at those prices , " he says .
but life in crawford market goes on .
customers haggle for a good price in corners of the market , out of the intense heat of the sun , traders ply their goods and foreign visitors admire the victorian architecture .
