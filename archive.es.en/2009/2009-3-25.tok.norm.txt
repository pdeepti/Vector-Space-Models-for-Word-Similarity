even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" at the moment this situation has no effect on the role of the president of the european council , " he said in an eu presidency statement .
topolanek said he would offer his resignation , but that the government could stay in place in a caretaker capacity until the end of the eu presidency , in june .
eu leadership worries the toppling of topolanek 's coalition raised concerns over the czech republic 's ability to carry out the rest of its eu leadership term , at a time when the world 's largest trading bloc is going through its worst economic crisis in decades .
topolanek 's ousting precedes the g20 summit of world leaders in london as well as a special eu summit with us president barack obama in early april .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is more skeptical of the eu europe needs strong leadership in these times of crisis , " joseph daul , head of the center-right european people 's party , the largest parliamentary group in strasbourg , told afp .
" a government which assumes the eu presidency , but in which there is no confidence , can not assume this leadership , " he added .
fate of lisbon treaty even more uncertain the fall of the czech government also calls into question the future of the controversial lisbon treaty , which is meant to streamline the eu bureaucracy but was torpedoed by the irish in a referendum .
even the czechs have cast their doubts about the treaty and although the document has already been approved in the lower house of parliament , the upper senate has yet to ratify it . topolanek had strongly supported the treaty despite opposition from party backbenchers .
he had even once said , " if i lose control of the situation -lrb- in my party -rrb- , then the lisbon treaty will not pass . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech eu presidency ends in june , when sweden takes over on the other hand , czech president vaclav klaus , who has the power to appoint a new prime minister with parliamentary backing , refused to confirm whether he would give his blessing to the treaty . klaus ' hand could be strengthened if topolanek 's government is replaced by one that is more skeptical of eu political integration .
image of eu 's leadership hurt even before the czechs assumed the eu presidency , there had already been concerns in diplomatic circles about the ability of topolanek 's government , as opposed to heavy hitters like france 's nicolas sarkozy , who preceded him , to lead the bloc during a deep economic crisis .
europe 's big three - france , germany and britain - are viewed as the eu 's major powers .
their leadership carries more weight in foreign affairs than that of smaller countries such as the czech republic , which joined the bloc in 2004 .
but european leaders are worried about the eu 's leadership image .
" for the stability and image of europe , it is going to become more difficult , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
in practical terms , even left-leaning czech opposition leader jiri paroubek said in prague after the vote that it was " natural that the government would stay until the end of the eu presidency " on june 30 when sweden takes over the reins in leading the 27 nation bloc . df / jen / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inmates there live and work in conditions that authorities hope will prepare them for a normal life after they get out . the only way to get to bastoy prison is to take the small prison ferry boat from the port of horten , about two hours south of oslo .
what was once a state institution for delinquent youths has now become the final stop for male inmates nearing the end of their sentences . but any similarities to rikers island in new york or the now defunct alcatraz in san francisco ends upon arrival .
bastoy looks like anything but a prison .
there are no high razor-wire fences , no concrete cell blocks and no watch towers .
instead , the small island looks more like a tranquil scandinavian health resort .
prisoners live in quaint wooden cottages overlooking pine forests , fields of wheat and inviting beaches . oyvind alnaes , the governor of bastoy , says that the prison is managed on ecological and humanist values . " we think that we have to treat the inmates in a proper way because they will open their ears and eyes and maybe are willing to learn something , " alnaes says .
" we use the ecological way of running this prison as a tool to learn responsibility and have concerns about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking care of horses teach prisoners responsibility for the some 110 male inmates that begins on day one .
all new arrivals are trained how to cook , clean and look after themselves .
each inmate has his own space in the typical four-bedroom cottages . " but there are still inspections to come and see that you clean your room and make your bed , " inmate haarvald says .
" it should look like a normal room that you have at home in a normal life and the best thing is that they are all in a social environment . "
he says it gives the inmates the feeling that " they belong to society . " responsibility and leisure during the day , most inmates are employed in some form of livestock , farming or maintenance work .
haarvald works with the island 's six horses that are used for plowing and for transporting supplies .
twice a day , he has to go to the ferry and pick up goods .
some days , there is nothing to pick up and many other prisoners question why they even have to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some prisoners are in charge of livestock " as soon as you take the reins of the horse , you are training him and this is part of their responsibilities , " haarvald says .

us and european policymakers are standing behind the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
their comments followed a chinese bid to see the currency replaced by international monetary fund coinage . an upcoming global economic summit could turn into a showdown over the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
china has publicly thrown its support behind other emerging economies such as russia which want to shift the world 's currency away from the dollar to a new currency run by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" the outbreak of the crisis and its spillover to the entire world reflected the inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system , " people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said in a speech posted on the people 's bank of china 's web site .
analysts say zhou 's recent comments are the latest sign of the country 's growing assertiveness on the international stage .
they also show a growing concern china has over the $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.3 trillion euros -rrb- it holds in us treasury bonds and reserve dollars .
us , europe want dollar to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama does n't see the need for a global currency the united states and europe have dismissed the idea of doing away with the dollar as the international reserve currency .
the european union 's top economic official said he thinks the dollar will remain the world 's major reserve currency .
eu commissioner joaquin almunia said he does n't see " major structural changes in the role the dollar plays today as a major reserve currency . "
top us leaders , including president barack obama , said they want the dollar to keep its current status .
" i do n't believe there is a need for a global currency , " us president barack obama said at a press conference on tuesday .
he noted that " the dollar is extraordinarily strong right now , " and although the united states was " going through a rough patch " at present , the dollar enjoyed a " great deal of confidence " from investors .
both us treasury secretary timothy geithner and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said they would not support a plan to strip the dollar of its reserve status .
issue likely to be debated at g20 summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china would like to see the imf take a more prominent role yet the idea is likely to be floated anyway at an upcoming group of 20 summit planned for london in april .
the meeting of industrialized countries will bring together top leaders in hopes of finding a common approach to the global financial crisis .
people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said he would support moving away from the dollar to an imf currency basket that would include a mixture of dollars , euros , sterling and yen .
the imf already created an international reserve asset in 1969 , but the special drawing rights , as it is called , is currently used only by governments and international institutions .
russia has said it will bring up the proposal at the upcoming g20 meeting in london .
russia said its has broad support for its proposal among countries such as brazil , india , china , south korea and south africa .
not likely to happen anytime soon in the near-term , such a radical departure from the way the global financial system works would be near impossible , economists say , although it could be feasible in the long term .
" the arguments for doing such a thing have economic merit , though the actual implementation of such a system would likely take a herculean effort and a great deal of consensus building amongst economic powers , " sacha tihanyi , currency strategist with scotia capital told afp news agency .
" this is an idea , the idea of a global currency , determined by multilateral organizations , which is not new , but it 's a serious proposal , " john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , said at a news conference in response to a question about china 's proposal .
china growing more assertive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the biggest us creditor the recent comments by china 's top banker follows on comments made by china 's premier earlier this month .
they show how concerned the country is about its us assets .
" we have lent huge amounts of money to the united states .
of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets , " chinese premier wen jiabao said two weeks ago .
china holds us treasury bonds worth $ 739.6 billion as of january .
it is also the world 's largest holder of us dollars as a reserve currency , holding more than $ 1 trillion , according to us government figures .
" china appears to be growing more and more assertive over its rights , " currency analyst andrew busch of bmo capital markets told afp news agency .

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inmates there live and work in conditions that authorities hope will prepare them for a normal life after they get out . the only way to get to bastoy prison is to take the small prison ferry boat from the port of horten , about two hours south of oslo .
what was once a state institution for delinquent youths has now become the final stop for male inmates nearing the end of their sentences . but any similarities to rikers island in new york or the now defunct alcatraz in san francisco ends upon arrival .
bastoy looks like anything but a prison .
there are no high razor-wire fences , no concrete cell blocks and no watch towers .
instead , the small island looks more like a tranquil scandinavian health resort .
prisoners live in quaint wooden cottages overlooking pine forests , fields of wheat and inviting beaches . oyvind alnaes , the governor of bastoy , says that the prison is managed on ecological and humanist values . " we think that we have to treat the inmates in a proper way because they will open their ears and eyes and maybe are willing to learn something , " alnaes says .
" we use the ecological way of running this prison as a tool to learn responsibility and have concerns about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prisoner 's cottages must be maintained by the inmates themselves for the some 110 male inmates that begins on day one .
all new arrivals are trained how to cook , clean and look after themselves .
each inmate has his own space in the typical four-bedroom cottages . " but there are still inspections to come and see that you clean your room and make your bed , " inmate haarvald says .
" it should look like a normal room that you have at home in a normal life and the best thing is that they are all in a social environment . "
he says it gives the inmates the feeling that " they belong to society . " responsibility and leisure during the day , most inmates are employed in some form of livestock , farming or maintenance work .
haarvald works with the island 's six horses that are used for plowing and for transporting supplies .
twice a day , he has to go to the ferry and pick up goods .
some days , there is nothing to pick up and many other prisoners question why they even have to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking care of horses teach prisoners responsibility " as soon as you take the reins of the horse , you are training him and this is part of their responsibilities , " haarvald says .
" and here we 're talking about tough criminals - they get a responsibility and they can take it with them outside as a free man . " responsibilities at work also provide opportunities for leisure on the island .
for haarvald , that means he can ride horses in his free time . " on a sunday morning , i get up on a horse and go down by the beach - the sun has just come up , birds are flying , a seal is lying on the rock outside , " he says .
" you have to pinch your arm to remember where you are . " building trust for the 30 prison officers at bastoy , dialogue and trust with inmates is important .
officers and inmates call each other by their first names .
principal officer mia eklassens says bastoy makes a good place for inmates to end their sentences . " here we are trying to give you a great deal of trust and trying to work with you so that you are not going to prison again , " eklassens says .
" we 're trying to give the prisoners some sense of pride in what he has accomplished while he is here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some prisoners are in charge of livestock in addition , the prison tries to help inmates deal with problems like drugs , violence and reconnecting with their families . " that 's why i think it 's a good place to serve your sentence , " eklassens says . special freedoms bastoy prison might function well as a liberal institution .
but norway also has the full spectrum of jails , including maximum security facilities .
for george , one of the few foreign inmates on bastoy , serving out his sentence on the island is like leading a normal life compared to conditions he experienced in ringerike , norway 's maximum security prison . " that one was perhaps the toughest prison in the whole of norway because the way you are treated there in a way brings you down , " george says .
" i would have been a very bitter man when i would have come out of ringerike . " the prisoners of bastoy are fortunate to live in surroundings that many of norway 's prisoners would wish to appreciate during their sentences .
while prison staff believe they work in the best prison in the world , the jury is still out on whether time at bastoy is the catalyst for inmates putting a life of crime behind them for good . what is certain , though , is that the inmate islanders live in a unique prison .
life is not a beach at bastoy but there is a chance for prisoners to enjoy a special kind of freedom and to regain responsibility over the lives . guy degen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.03.2009 us brewer loses eu-wide rights to budweiser name in court ruling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : battles over the budweiser name goes back nearly a century .
even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 25.03.2009 munich court lifts ban on reprints of nazi-era newspapers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi newspaper replica contains historians ' annotations .
a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "
he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .
" we 're a laughing stock internationally with such ludicrous discussions , " said hans mommsen , 78 , a historian who is one of the moving forces behind the project to reproduce the annotated editions in an interview with dpa news agency .
" and when law enforcement officials are called in and the editor faces federal prosecution , it just reveals germany 's neurosis when it comes to nazism , " he said .
mommsen , who is a professor emeritus from ruhr university and has been a guest professor at american universities such as harvard , princeton and berkeley even argued that hitler 's mein kampf autobiography , which is readily accessible in other countries should also available to the german public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm highly dubious of this project " , said stephan kramer .
" in israel you can buy mein kampf in any book shop , but here it is still banned , " said mommsen .
" that creates a mythic aura for a book which , when read , reveals its banality from a to z. to this very day there is no annotated edition of that book in german , " he said .
german media divided about reprints the nazi newspaper replicas have also divided the german news media .
the national sueddeutsche zeitung said that readers were intelligent enough to see through the propaganda themselves .
" you flick through these old newspapers as anyone born long after the war might : in shock and amazement .
the evil -lrb- is right there -rrb- on paper , " the national daily wrote .
a local paper in lower saxony , the peiner allgemeine zeitung suggested that the publishers could be motivated by commercial interests .
" hitler sells better than sex , " the paper said . df / nda / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "
he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .
" we 're a laughing stock internationally with such ludicrous discussions , " said hans mommsen , 78 , a historian who is one of the moving forces behind the project to reproduce the annotated editions in an interview with dpa news agency .
" and when law enforcement officials are called in and the editor faces federal prosecution , it just reveals germany 's neurosis when it comes to nazism , " he said .
mommsen , who is a professor emeritus from ruhr university and has been a guest professor at american universities such as harvard , princeton and berkeley even argued that hitler 's mein kampf autobiography , which is readily accessible in other countries should also available to the german public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm highly dubious of this project " , said stephan kramer .
" in israel you can buy mein kampf in any book shop , but here it is still banned , " said mommsen .
" that creates a mythic aura for a book which , when read , reveals its banality from a to z. to this very day there is no annotated edition of that book in german , " he said .
german media divided about reprints the nazi newspaper replicas have also divided the german news media .
the national sueddeutsche zeitung said that readers were intelligent enough to see through the propaganda themselves .

since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but jogi wants to keep his options open . the head of the german soccer federation gave the national team coach the kind of job multi-year job guarantee most german employees could only dream of . " there 's no cause at the moment to think about any other solutions , " zwanziger told german press agency dpa on wednesday , march 25 , when asked about possible replacements for the men 's team coach . loew has said he wants to wait until germany has qualified for south africa before considering extending his contract beyond 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will jogi be watching over the national team after 2010 ?
" when he thinks the time is right to talk about these things then we will certainly do so , " zwanziger said .
the dfb boss said he was not only " highly satisfied " with loew 's work as coach but had a high regard for him as a person . discussions about the future of national team manager oliver bierhoff are also ongoing .
the former international striker 's name is often mentioned in connection with managerial posts in the bundesliga .
his contract with the national team ends in 2010 . " what i do will be clear in the summer , " biefhoff told the daily express .
" one year notice is more than enough . " qualifier training begins the germany squad meanwhile met for training in leipzig , ahead of saturday 's group 4 world cup qualifier against liechtenstein . germany is hoping that a solid performance wednesday will help the team put an end to months of internal turmoil after captain michael ballack publically criticized loew 's treatment of veteran players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hope to hop along wtih a pair of wins " if the team plays well against liechtenstein and wales and delivers the six points , i expect issues which have been discussed in the past will quickly become a topic no more , " zwanziger told the sport bild newspaper , referring to last year 's spat . injuries leave loew without three members of his 21-man squad : goalkeeper rene adler , defender per mertesacker and midfielder piotr trochowski .
midfielder torsten frings and striker miroslav klose have also dropped out of the squad with injuries . the fitness tests in leipzig come after two home defeats to england and norway and some 18 months after the germany squad took part in a similar fitness check . " this is a stocktaking a year before the world cup in south africa , " loew said of the tests which among other things included sprint , stamina and reaction checks .
" we want to see where players need to work in physical areas .
we have to work where we see the need .
we ca n't stay still . " loew has highlighted perceived deficiencies in the german game , saying teams in england and spain were playing faster football than in the bundesliga . after the match against liechtenstein , the germans will travel to cardiff to meet wales on wednesday .

" we are living through a time of global economic challenges that can not be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation , " obama wrote in an opinion article published in more than two dozen leading global newspapers on tuesday , march 24 .
obama 's media outreach was matched by british prime minister gordon brown , who will host the upcoming g20 meeting .

at last week 's eu summit in brussels , leaders of the 27-member bloc rejected recent us calls to extend the size of their 400-billion-euro -lrb- $ 544-billion -rrb- stimulus package .

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .

with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .

" there is little knowledge about what really happened behind the iron curtain in the baltic states .
it needs to be brought to light and condemned , " she told dpa .
kalniete said she was encouraged by the fact that the events were being marked in european forums .
on march 23 at the opening of the european parliament 's strasbourg plenary session , the parliament 's president hans-gert poettering made a special declaration recalling the deportations .
" this is not a distant and obscure past ; it is still very much a living memory in the minds of many people who are citizens of the european union , " poettering said , describing condemnation of the soviets ' crimes as " our moral obligation and a fundamental duty as europeans . "
" it is important that the suffering endured by the victims is acknowledged at the european level , not just at the national level , " kalniete agreed .

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german invasion of russia delayed the first deportations a first wave of deportations of " enemies of the state " took place in 1941 but was interrupted by nazi germany 's invasion of russia , breaking the infamous molotov-ribbentrop pact which had consigned the independent baltic states to the soviet sphere of influence .
with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german invasion of russia delayed the first deportations a first wave of deportations of " enemies of the state " took place in 1941 but was interrupted by nazi germany 's invasion of russia , breaking the infamous molotov-ribbentrop pact which had consigned the independent baltic states to the soviet sphere of influence .
with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalniete , a daughter of deportees , wants more coverage latvian member of parliament and former eu commissioner sandra kalniete was born in siberia after her parents were deported from their homeland .
" there is little knowledge about what really happened behind the iron curtain in the baltic states .
it needs to be brought to light and condemned , " she told dpa .
kalniete said she was encouraged by the fact that the events were being marked in european forums .
on march 23 at the opening of the european parliament 's strasbourg plenary session , the parliament 's president hans-gert poettering made a special declaration recalling the deportations .
" this is not a distant and obscure past ; it is still very much a living memory in the minds of many people who are citizens of the european union , " poettering said , describing condemnation of the soviets ' crimes as " our moral obligation and a fundamental duty as europeans . "
" it is important that the suffering endured by the victims is acknowledged at the european level , not just at the national level , " kalniete agreed .

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "

the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expecting thousands of nato protestors german authorities have said they expect about 25,000 demonstrators to show up for the nato summit , which will be held in the towns of baden-baden and kehl in germany and strasbourg in france .
germany will provide 600 soldiers and 15,000 police to guard the 3,500 delegates from attacks , germany has said .
germany and nato will also deploy warplanes and surveillance aircraft to patrol the airspace .

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de anheuser-busch loses eu trademark for budweiser the european battle of the buds continues as a european union court annulled an eu-wide trademark for anheuser-busch 's bud beer , which has been contested by czech brewer budejovicky budvar .

mps were outraged that le pen continues to downplay nazi atrocities . the main groups in the eu parliament decided they would change the rules in order to keep le pen from taking on the honorary role of presiding over the european parliament 's opening session this summer .
joseph daul , head of the european people 's party - the biggest grouping in the parliament - said he would " do everything possible " to prevent le pen from taking the chair .
daul is backed by socialists and the greens in parliament .
le pen insists he 's the victim of " inflammatory accusations " by the parliamentary socialist group head , german european mp martin schulz , who had branded him a holocaust denier .
" i just said that the gas chambers were a detail of second world war history , which is clear , " he told a sitting of the european parliament in strasbourg , france on wednesday , march 25 .

he shocked europe in 2002 when he placed second in the french presidential elections .

back in 1987 , le pen was fined 1.2 million francs -lrb- 185,000 euros , $ 290,000 -rrb- for making remarks downplaying the holocaust in a radio interview .
" that proved the state we find the freedom of speech in europe and france , " he said , recalling the case .
parliament 's most senior member le pen was first elected to the european parliament in 1984 .
if he is elected at the top of the national front ticket , he would be granted the honor of presiding over the opening session of parliament due to his seniority and age .
" i am concerned by the fact that a holocaust denier could preside over the opening session of the european parliament , " schulz had said previously .

" at the moment this situation has no effect on the role of the president of the european council , " he said in an eu presidency statement .
topolanek said he would offer his resignation , but that the government could stay in place in a caretaker capacity until the end of the eu presidency , in june .
eu leadership worries the toppling of topolanek 's coalition raised concerns over the czech republic 's ability to carry out the rest of its eu leadership term , at a time when the world 's largest trading bloc is going through its worst economic crisis in decades .

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "

" we are living through a time of global economic challenges that can not be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation , " obama wrote in an opinion article published in more than two dozen leading global newspapers on tuesday , march 24 .
obama 's media outreach was matched by british prime minister gordon brown , who will host the upcoming g20 meeting .
brown embarked on a world tour to try and drum up international support for economic stimulus measures and reforms .
europe wary on stimulus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has held back on further stimulus measures european governments , particularly france and germany , have been cool to obama 's calls for additional stimulus measures .
at last week 's eu summit in brussels , leaders of the 27-member bloc rejected recent us calls to extend the size of their 400-billion-euro -lrb- $ 544-billion -rrb- stimulus package .
instead , many european leaders want to see tougher regulation of financial institutions .
" -lrb- we need -rrb- coordination at all levels , no loopholes , no black holes , " french economics minister christine lagarde told a financial conference in prague tuesday in a taped video message .
us will outline reform plans this week obama agreed that more regulation is needed .

us treasury secretary timothy geithner is expected to unveil the government 's plans for regulatory reform on thursday , the white house said .
geithner said he supports far-reaching regulatory reform .
" all institutions and markets that could pose systemic risk will be subject to strong oversight , including appropriate constraints on risk taking , " geithner recently told a congressional committee .
obama 's media outreach came one day after geithner announced a public-private plan that will take over $ 1 trillion in so-called toxic bank assets .

brown called for more regulation of the financial markets and more coordinated stimulus of world economies in a speech before the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" regulatory standards should be set across europe and the world , " he said .
" worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to the economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries . "
europe and american need to work more closely , brown added , noting that he spoke with obama about the need for cooperation on monday .
" never in recent years have we had an american leadership so keen on working closely with europe . "

bastoy looks like anything but a prison .
there are no high razor-wire fences , no concrete cell blocks and no watch towers .

" we think that we have to treat the inmates in a proper way because they will open their ears and eyes and maybe are willing to learn something , " alnaes says .

" i would have been a very bitter man when i would have come out of ringerike . " the prisoners of bastoy are fortunate to live in surroundings that many of norway 's prisoners would wish to appreciate during their sentences .

" we are living through a time of global economic challenges that can not be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation , " obama wrote in an opinion article published in more than two dozen leading global newspapers on tuesday , march 24 .
obama 's media outreach was matched by british prime minister gordon brown , who will host the upcoming g20 meeting .
brown embarked on a world tour to try and drum up international support for economic stimulus measures and reforms .
europe wary on stimulus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has held back on further stimulus measures european governments , particularly france and germany , have been cool to obama 's calls for additional stimulus measures .
at last week 's eu summit in brussels , leaders of the 27-member bloc rejected recent us calls to extend the size of their 400-billion-euro -lrb- $ 544-billion -rrb- stimulus package .
instead , many european leaders want to see tougher regulation of financial institutions .
" -lrb- we need -rrb- coordination at all levels , no loopholes , no black holes , " french economics minister christine lagarde told a financial conference in prague tuesday in a taped video message .
us will outline reform plans this week obama agreed that more regulation is needed .
" if we continue to let financial institutions around the world act recklessly and irresponsibly , we will remain trapped in a cycle of bubble and bust , " obama wrote in his newspaper piece .
us treasury secretary timothy geithner is expected to unveil the government 's plans for regulatory reform on thursday , the white house said .
geithner said he supports far-reaching regulatory reform .
" all institutions and markets that could pose systemic risk will be subject to strong oversight , including appropriate constraints on risk taking , " geithner recently told a congressional committee .
obama 's media outreach came one day after geithner announced a public-private plan that will take over $ 1 trillion in so-called toxic bank assets .
gordon seeks international consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he wants more financial regulations britain 's brown is taking his message that both stimulus and regulatory measures are necessary on a world tour .
brown called for more regulation of the financial markets and more coordinated stimulus of world economies in a speech before the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" regulatory standards should be set across europe and the world , " he said .
" worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to the economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries . "
europe and american need to work more closely , brown added , noting that he spoke with obama about the need for cooperation on monday .
" never in recent years have we had an american leadership so keen on working closely with europe . "
brown will fly to new york for a meeting with un secretary-general ban ki-moon and then to latin america for talks in brazil and chile . th / nda / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at last week 's eu summit in brussels , leaders of the 27-member bloc rejected recent us calls to extend the size of their 400-billion-euro -lrb- $ 544-billion -rrb- stimulus package .
instead , many european leaders want to see tougher regulation of financial institutions .
" -lrb- we need -rrb- coordination at all levels , no loopholes , no black holes , " french economics minister christine lagarde told a financial conference in prague tuesday in a taped video message .
us will outline reform plans this week obama agreed that more regulation is needed .
" if we continue to let financial institutions around the world act recklessly and irresponsibly , we will remain trapped in a cycle of bubble and bust , " obama wrote in his newspaper piece .
us treasury secretary timothy geithner is expected to unveil the government 's plans for regulatory reform on thursday , the white house said .
geithner said he supports far-reaching regulatory reform .
" all institutions and markets that could pose systemic risk will be subject to strong oversight , including appropriate constraints on risk taking , " geithner recently told a congressional committee .
obama 's media outreach came one day after geithner announced a public-private plan that will take over $ 1 trillion in so-called toxic bank assets .
gordon seeks international consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he wants more financial regulations britain 's brown is taking his message that both stimulus and regulatory measures are necessary on a world tour .
brown called for more regulation of the financial markets and more coordinated stimulus of world economies in a speech before the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" regulatory standards should be set across europe and the world , " he said .
" worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to the economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries . "
europe and american need to work more closely , brown added , noting that he spoke with obama about the need for cooperation on monday .
" never in recent years have we had an american leadership so keen on working closely with europe . "
brown will fly to new york for a meeting with un secretary-general ban ki-moon and then to latin america for talks in brazil and chile . th / nda / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "
he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .
" we 're a laughing stock internationally with such ludicrous discussions , " said hans mommsen , 78 , a historian who is one of the moving forces behind the project to reproduce the annotated editions in an interview with dpa news agency .
" and when law enforcement officials are called in and the editor faces federal prosecution , it just reveals germany 's neurosis when it comes to nazism , " he said .
mommsen , who is a professor emeritus from ruhr university and has been a guest professor at american universities such as harvard , princeton and berkeley even argued that hitler 's mein kampf autobiography , which is readily accessible in other countries should also available to the german public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm highly dubious of this project " , said stephan kramer .
" in israel you can buy mein kampf in any book shop , but here it is still banned , " said mommsen .
" that creates a mythic aura for a book which , when read , reveals its banality from a to z. to this very day there is no annotated edition of that book in german , " he said .
german media divided about reprints the nazi newspaper replicas have also divided the german news media .
the national sueddeutsche zeitung said that readers were intelligent enough to see through the propaganda themselves .

inmates there live and work in conditions that authorities hope will prepare them for a normal life after they get out . the only way to get to bastoy prison is to take the small prison ferry boat from the port of horten , about two hours south of oslo .
what was once a state institution for delinquent youths has now become the final stop for male inmates nearing the end of their sentences . but any similarities to rikers island in new york or the now defunct alcatraz in san francisco ends upon arrival .
bastoy looks like anything but a prison .
there are no high razor-wire fences , no concrete cell blocks and no watch towers .
instead , the small island looks more like a tranquil scandinavian health resort .
prisoners live in quaint wooden cottages overlooking pine forests , fields of wheat and inviting beaches . oyvind alnaes , the governor of bastoy , says that the prison is managed on ecological and humanist values . " we think that we have to treat the inmates in a proper way because they will open their ears and eyes and maybe are willing to learn something , " alnaes says .
" we use the ecological way of running this prison as a tool to learn responsibility and have concerns about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking care of horses teach prisoners responsibility for the some 110 male inmates that begins on day one .
all new arrivals are trained how to cook , clean and look after themselves .
each inmate has his own space in the typical four-bedroom cottages . " but there are still inspections to come and see that you clean your room and make your bed , " inmate haarvald says .
" it should look like a normal room that you have at home in a normal life and the best thing is that they are all in a social environment . "
he says it gives the inmates the feeling that " they belong to society . " responsibility and leisure during the day , most inmates are employed in some form of livestock , farming or maintenance work .
haarvald works with the island 's six horses that are used for plowing and for transporting supplies .
twice a day , he has to go to the ferry and pick up goods .
some days , there is nothing to pick up and many other prisoners question why they even have to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some prisoners are in charge of livestock " as soon as you take the reins of the horse , you are training him and this is part of their responsibilities , " haarvald says .
" and here we 're talking about tough criminals - they get a responsibility and they can take it with them outside as a free man . " responsibilities at work also provide opportunities for leisure on the island .
for haarvald , that means he can ride horses in his free time . " on a sunday morning , i get up on a horse and go down by the beach - the sun has just come up , birds are flying , a seal is lying on the rock outside , " he says .
" you have to pinch your arm to remember where you are . " building trust for the 30 prison officers at bastoy , dialogue and trust with inmates is important .
officers and inmates call each other by their first names .
principal officer mia eklassens says bastoy makes a good place for inmates to end their sentences . " here we are trying to give you a great deal of trust and trying to work with you so that you are not going to prison again , " eklassens says .
" we 're trying to give the prisoners some sense of pride in what he has accomplished while he is here . " # b # in addition , the prison tries to help inmates deal with problems like drugs , violence and reconnecting with their families . " that 's why i think it 's a good place to serve your sentence , " eklassens says . special freedoms bastoy prison might function well as a liberal institution .
but norway also has the full spectrum of jails , including maximum security facilities .
for george , one of the few foreign inmates on bastoy , serving out his sentence on the island is like leading a normal life compared to conditions he experienced in ringerike , norway 's maximum security prison . " that one was perhaps the toughest prison in the whole of norway because the way you are treated there in a way brings you down , " george says .
" i would have been a very bitter man when i would have come out of ringerike . " the prisoners of bastoy are fortunate to live in surroundings that many of norway 's prisoners would wish to appreciate during their sentences .
while prison staff believe they work in the best prison in the world , the jury is still out on whether time at bastoy is the catalyst for inmates putting a life of crime behind them for good . what is certain , though , is that the inmate islanders live in a unique prison .
life is not a beach at bastoy but there is a chance for prisoners to enjoy a special kind of freedom and to regain responsibility over the lives . guy degen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.03.2009 us brewer loses eu-wide rights to budweiser name in court ruling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : battles over the budweiser name goes back nearly a century .
even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .

but jogi wants to keep his options open . the head of the german soccer federation gave the national team coach the kind of job multi-year job guarantee most german employees could only dream of . " there 's no cause at the moment to think about any other solutions , " zwanziger told german press agency dpa on wednesday , march 25 , when asked about possible replacements for the men 's team coach . loew has said he wants to wait until germany has qualified for south africa before considering extending his contract beyond 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will jogi be watching over the national team after 2010 ?
" when he thinks the time is right to talk about these things then we will certainly do so , " zwanziger said .
the dfb boss said he was not only " highly satisfied " with loew 's work as coach but had a high regard for him as a person . discussions about the future of national team manager oliver bierhoff are also ongoing .
the former international striker 's name is often mentioned in connection with managerial posts in the bundesliga .
his contract with the national team ends in 2010 . " what i do will be clear in the summer , " biefhoff told the daily express .
" one year notice is more than enough . " qualifier training begins the germany squad meanwhile met for training in leipzig , ahead of saturday 's group 4 world cup qualifier against liechtenstein . germany is hoping that a solid performance wednesday will help the team put an end to months of internal turmoil after captain michael ballack publically criticized loew 's treatment of veteran players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hope to hop along wtih a pair of wins " if the team plays well against liechtenstein and wales and delivers the six points , i expect issues which have been discussed in the past will quickly become a topic no more , " zwanziger told the sport bild newspaper , referring to last year 's spat . injuries leave loew without three members of his 21-man squad : goalkeeper rene adler , defender per mertesacker and midfielder piotr trochowski .
midfielder torsten frings and striker miroslav klose have also dropped out of the squad with injuries . the fitness tests in leipzig come after two home defeats to england and norway and some 18 months after the germany squad took part in a similar fitness check . " this is a stocktaking a year before the world cup in south africa , " loew said of the tests which among other things included sprint , stamina and reaction checks .
" we want to see where players need to work in physical areas .
we have to work where we see the need .
we ca n't stay still . " loew has highlighted perceived deficiencies in the german game , saying teams in england and spain were playing faster football than in the bundesliga . after the match against liechtenstein , the germans will travel to cardiff to meet wales on wednesday .

" at the moment this situation has no effect on the role of the president of the european council , " he said in an eu presidency statement .
topolanek said he would offer his resignation , but that the government could stay in place in a caretaker capacity until the end of the eu presidency , in june .
eu leadership worries the toppling of topolanek 's coalition raised concerns over the czech republic 's ability to carry out the rest of its eu leadership term , at a time when the world 's largest trading bloc is going through its worst economic crisis in decades .

even the czechs have cast their doubts about the treaty and although the document has already been approved in the lower house of parliament , the upper senate has yet to ratify it . topolanek had strongly supported the treaty despite opposition from party backbenchers .

us and european policymakers are standing behind the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
their comments followed a chinese bid to see the currency replaced by international monetary fund coinage . an upcoming global economic summit could turn into a showdown over the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
china has publicly thrown its support behind other emerging economies such as russia which want to shift the world 's currency away from the dollar to a new currency run by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" the outbreak of the crisis and its spillover to the entire world reflected the inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system , " people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said in a speech posted on the people 's bank of china 's web site .

" when we speak about child sexual abuse and sexual exploitation , we are speaking about horrendous crimes against children that leave deep scars and suffering for their whole lives , " barrot said .
the eu said it needs to improve cooperation with non-european countries to go after child pornographers and traffickers who operate outside the bloc .
as well as pushing for eu-wide rules on human trafficking , the commission also wants sex tourists to face prosecution when they return to the eu .
the eu also said it plans to work with credit card companies to prevent child pornography from being purchased on the internet . ml / th / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .

with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .

kalniete said she was encouraged by the fact that the events were being marked in european forums .
on march 23 at the opening of the european parliament 's strasbourg plenary session , the parliament 's president hans-gert poettering made a special declaration recalling the deportations .

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .

with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .

a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "
he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .
" we 're a laughing stock internationally with such ludicrous discussions , " said hans mommsen , 78 , a historian who is one of the moving forces behind the project to reproduce the annotated editions in an interview with dpa news agency .
" and when law enforcement officials are called in and the editor faces federal prosecution , it just reveals germany 's neurosis when it comes to nazism , " he said .
mommsen , who is a professor emeritus from ruhr university and has been a guest professor at american universities such as harvard , princeton and berkeley even argued that hitler 's mein kampf autobiography , which is readily accessible in other countries should also available to the german public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm highly dubious of this project " , said stephan kramer .
" in israel you can buy mein kampf in any book shop , but here it is still banned , " said mommsen .
" that creates a mythic aura for a book which , when read , reveals its banality from a to z. to this very day there is no annotated edition of that book in german , " he said .
german media divided about reprints the nazi newspaper replicas have also divided the german news media .
the national sueddeutsche zeitung said that readers were intelligent enough to see through the propaganda themselves .
" you flick through these old newspapers as anyone born long after the war might : in shock and amazement .
the evil -lrb- is right there -rrb- on paper , " the national daily wrote .
a local paper in lower saxony , the peiner allgemeine zeitung suggested that the publishers could be motivated by commercial interests .

if the proposals are approved by parliament and implemented , anyone trying to access specific web sites will find an empty screen or be redirected to a stop sign .
internet porn the start of a slippery slope , claims minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen warned of the " entry drug " of porn according to the german government 's family minister ursula von der leyen , the ready availability of internet child pornography acts as a form of " entry drug “ for many pedophiles . once established , the addiction can lead to more violent forms of behavior such as abduction , rape and murder .
although the new measures have been welcomed by the federal telecommunications association bitkom , the association 's managing director bernhard rohleder warned against expecting the problems of internet child pornography to be solved once and for all . barring access to certain web sites was a useful measure , he said , as it would reduce the number of chance " hits “ to web sites hosting images of child pornography .
but rohleder added that the proposed new measures would have a limited effect as pedophiles intent on gaining access to child pornography would find ways to feed their habit by taking measures such as concealing the internet address of their home computers . commercial child pornography web sites are also unlikely to be affected by the proposed new law as most of them are accessed through so-called " peer-to-peer " servers , which internet service providers are powerless to control .
eu follows with new protection proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot called for standardized legislation across the eu meanwhile , the european commission today unveiled new proposals to clamp down on child pornography , child sex tourism and human trafficking .
speaking in brussels this morning , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot called for standardizing legislation on sex crimes against children throughout the eu 's 27 member states . " when we speak about child sexual abuse and sexual exploitation , we are speaking about horrendous crimes against children that leave deep scars and suffering for their whole lives , " barrot said .
the eu said it needs to improve cooperation with non-european countries to go after child pornographers and traffickers who operate outside the bloc .
as well as pushing for eu-wide rules on human trafficking , the commission also wants sex tourists to face prosecution when they return to the eu .
the eu also said it plans to work with credit card companies to prevent child pornography from being purchased on the internet . ml / th / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german invasion of russia delayed the first deportations a first wave of deportations of " enemies of the state " took place in 1941 but was interrupted by nazi germany 's invasion of russia , breaking the infamous molotov-ribbentrop pact which had consigned the independent baltic states to the soviet sphere of influence .
with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalniete , a daughter of deportees , wants more coverage latvian member of parliament and former eu commissioner sandra kalniete was born in siberia after her parents were deported from their homeland .
" there is little knowledge about what really happened behind the iron curtain in the baltic states .
it needs to be brought to light and condemned , " she told dpa .
kalniete said she was encouraged by the fact that the events were being marked in european forums .
on march 23 at the opening of the european parliament 's strasbourg plenary session , the parliament 's president hans-gert poettering made a special declaration recalling the deportations .
" this is not a distant and obscure past ; it is still very much a living memory in the minds of many people who are citizens of the european union , " poettering said , describing condemnation of the soviets ' crimes as " our moral obligation and a fundamental duty as europeans . "
" it is important that the suffering endured by the victims is acknowledged at the european level , not just at the national level , " kalniete agreed .
" my parents were deported , and my grandparents perished in siberia .
i will be marking the day by laying flowers at the latvian freedom monument . " nda / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are living through a time of global economic challenges that can not be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation , " obama wrote in an opinion article published in more than two dozen leading global newspapers on tuesday , march 24 .
obama 's media outreach was matched by british prime minister gordon brown , who will host the upcoming g20 meeting .
brown embarked on a world tour to try and drum up international support for economic stimulus measures and reforms .
europe wary on stimulus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has held back on further stimulus measures european governments , particularly france and germany , have been cool to obama 's calls for additional stimulus measures .
at last week 's eu summit in brussels , leaders of the 27-member bloc rejected recent us calls to extend the size of their 400-billion-euro -lrb- $ 544-billion -rrb- stimulus package .
instead , many european leaders want to see tougher regulation of financial institutions .
" -lrb- we need -rrb- coordination at all levels , no loopholes , no black holes , " french economics minister christine lagarde told a financial conference in prague tuesday in a taped video message .
us will outline reform plans this week obama agreed that more regulation is needed .
" if we continue to let financial institutions around the world act recklessly and irresponsibly , we will remain trapped in a cycle of bubble and bust , " obama wrote in his newspaper piece .
us treasury secretary timothy geithner is expected to unveil the government 's plans for regulatory reform on thursday , the white house said .
geithner said he supports far-reaching regulatory reform .
" all institutions and markets that could pose systemic risk will be subject to strong oversight , including appropriate constraints on risk taking , " geithner recently told a congressional committee .
obama 's media outreach came one day after geithner announced a public-private plan that will take over $ 1 trillion in so-called toxic bank assets .
gordon seeks international consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he wants more financial regulations britain 's brown is taking his message that both stimulus and regulatory measures are necessary on a world tour .
brown called for more regulation of the financial markets and more coordinated stimulus of world economies in a speech before the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" regulatory standards should be set across europe and the world , " he said .
" worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to the economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries . "
europe and american need to work more closely , brown added , noting that he spoke with obama about the need for cooperation on monday .
" never in recent years have we had an american leadership so keen on working closely with europe . "
brown will fly to new york for a meeting with un secretary-general ban ki-moon and then to latin america for talks in brazil and chile . th / nda / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are living through a time of global economic challenges that can not be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation , " obama wrote in an opinion article published in more than two dozen leading global newspapers on tuesday , march 24 .
obama 's media outreach was matched by british prime minister gordon brown , who will host the upcoming g20 meeting .
brown embarked on a world tour to try and drum up international support for economic stimulus measures and reforms .
europe wary on stimulus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has held back on further stimulus measures european governments , particularly france and germany , have been cool to obama 's calls for additional stimulus measures .
at last week 's eu summit in brussels , leaders of the 27-member bloc rejected recent us calls to extend the size of their 400-billion-euro -lrb- $ 544-billion -rrb- stimulus package .
instead , many european leaders want to see tougher regulation of financial institutions .
" -lrb- we need -rrb- coordination at all levels , no loopholes , no black holes , " french economics minister christine lagarde told a financial conference in prague tuesday in a taped video message .
us will outline reform plans this week obama agreed that more regulation is needed .
" if we continue to let financial institutions around the world act recklessly and irresponsibly , we will remain trapped in a cycle of bubble and bust , " obama wrote in his newspaper piece .
us treasury secretary timothy geithner is expected to unveil the government 's plans for regulatory reform on thursday , the white house said .
geithner said he supports far-reaching regulatory reform .
" all institutions and markets that could pose systemic risk will be subject to strong oversight , including appropriate constraints on risk taking , " geithner recently told a congressional committee .
obama 's media outreach came one day after geithner announced a public-private plan that will take over $ 1 trillion in so-called toxic bank assets .
gordon seeks international consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he wants more financial regulations britain 's brown is taking his message that both stimulus and regulatory measures are necessary on a world tour .
brown called for more regulation of the financial markets and more coordinated stimulus of world economies in a speech before the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" regulatory standards should be set across europe and the world , " he said .
" worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to the economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries . "
europe and american need to work more closely , brown added , noting that he spoke with obama about the need for cooperation on monday .
" never in recent years have we had an american leadership so keen on working closely with europe . "
brown will fly to new york for a meeting with un secretary-general ban ki-moon and then to latin america for talks in brazil and chile . th / nda / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are living through a time of global economic challenges that can not be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation , " obama wrote in an opinion article published in more than two dozen leading global newspapers on tuesday , march 24 .
obama 's media outreach was matched by british prime minister gordon brown , who will host the upcoming g20 meeting .
brown embarked on a world tour to try and drum up international support for economic stimulus measures and reforms .
europe wary on stimulus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has held back on further stimulus measures european governments , particularly france and germany , have been cool to obama 's calls for additional stimulus measures .
at last week 's eu summit in brussels , leaders of the 27-member bloc rejected recent us calls to extend the size of their 400-billion-euro -lrb- $ 544-billion -rrb- stimulus package .
instead , many european leaders want to see tougher regulation of financial institutions .
" -lrb- we need -rrb- coordination at all levels , no loopholes , no black holes , " french economics minister christine lagarde told a financial conference in prague tuesday in a taped video message .
us will outline reform plans this week obama agreed that more regulation is needed .
" if we continue to let financial institutions around the world act recklessly and irresponsibly , we will remain trapped in a cycle of bubble and bust , " obama wrote in his newspaper piece .
us treasury secretary timothy geithner is expected to unveil the government 's plans for regulatory reform on thursday , the white house said .
geithner said he supports far-reaching regulatory reform .
" all institutions and markets that could pose systemic risk will be subject to strong oversight , including appropriate constraints on risk taking , " geithner recently told a congressional committee .
obama 's media outreach came one day after geithner announced a public-private plan that will take over $ 1 trillion in so-called toxic bank assets .
gordon seeks international consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he wants more financial regulations britain 's brown is taking his message that both stimulus and regulatory measures are necessary on a world tour .
brown called for more regulation of the financial markets and more coordinated stimulus of world economies in a speech before the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" regulatory standards should be set across europe and the world , " he said .
" worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to the economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries . "
europe and american need to work more closely , brown added , noting that he spoke with obama about the need for cooperation on monday .
" never in recent years have we had an american leadership so keen on working closely with europe . "
brown will fly to new york for a meeting with un secretary-general ban ki-moon and then to latin america for talks in brazil and chile . th / nda / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .

a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .

" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .

obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .

after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expecting thousands of nato protestors german authorities have said they expect about 25,000 demonstrators to show up for the nato summit , which will be held in the towns of baden-baden and kehl in germany and strasbourg in france .

" we are living through a time of global economic challenges that can not be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation , " obama wrote in an opinion article published in more than two dozen leading global newspapers on tuesday , march 24 .
obama 's media outreach was matched by british prime minister gordon brown , who will host the upcoming g20 meeting .
brown embarked on a world tour to try and drum up international support for economic stimulus measures and reforms .
europe wary on stimulus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has held back on further stimulus measures european governments , particularly france and germany , have been cool to obama 's calls for additional stimulus measures .
at last week 's eu summit in brussels , leaders of the 27-member bloc rejected recent us calls to extend the size of their 400-billion-euro -lrb- $ 544-billion -rrb- stimulus package .
instead , many european leaders want to see tougher regulation of financial institutions .
" -lrb- we need -rrb- coordination at all levels , no loopholes , no black holes , " french economics minister christine lagarde told a financial conference in prague tuesday in a taped video message .
us will outline reform plans this week obama agreed that more regulation is needed .
" if we continue to let financial institutions around the world act recklessly and irresponsibly , we will remain trapped in a cycle of bubble and bust , " obama wrote in his newspaper piece .
us treasury secretary timothy geithner is expected to unveil the government 's plans for regulatory reform on thursday , the white house said .
geithner said he supports far-reaching regulatory reform .
" all institutions and markets that could pose systemic risk will be subject to strong oversight , including appropriate constraints on risk taking , " geithner recently told a congressional committee .
obama 's media outreach came one day after geithner announced a public-private plan that will take over $ 1 trillion in so-called toxic bank assets .
gordon seeks international consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he wants more financial regulations britain 's brown is taking his message that both stimulus and regulatory measures are necessary on a world tour .
brown called for more regulation of the financial markets and more coordinated stimulus of world economies in a speech before the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" regulatory standards should be set across europe and the world , " he said .
" worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to the economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries . "
europe and american need to work more closely , brown added , noting that he spoke with obama about the need for cooperation on monday .
" never in recent years have we had an american leadership so keen on working closely with europe . "
brown will fly to new york for a meeting with un secretary-general ban ki-moon and then to latin america for talks in brazil and chile . th / nda / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german invasion of russia delayed the first deportations a first wave of deportations of " enemies of the state " took place in 1941 but was interrupted by nazi germany 's invasion of russia , breaking the infamous molotov-ribbentrop pact which had consigned the independent baltic states to the soviet sphere of influence .
with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalniete , a daughter of deportees , wants more coverage latvian member of parliament and former eu commissioner sandra kalniete was born in siberia after her parents were deported from their homeland .
" there is little knowledge about what really happened behind the iron curtain in the baltic states .
it needs to be brought to light and condemned , " she told dpa .
kalniete said she was encouraged by the fact that the events were being marked in european forums .
on march 23 at the opening of the european parliament 's strasbourg plenary session , the parliament 's president hans-gert poettering made a special declaration recalling the deportations .
" this is not a distant and obscure past ; it is still very much a living memory in the minds of many people who are citizens of the european union , " poettering said , describing condemnation of the soviets ' crimes as " our moral obligation and a fundamental duty as europeans . "
" it is important that the suffering endured by the victims is acknowledged at the european level , not just at the national level , " kalniete agreed .

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german invasion of russia delayed the first deportations a first wave of deportations of " enemies of the state " took place in 1941 but was interrupted by nazi germany 's invasion of russia , breaking the infamous molotov-ribbentrop pact which had consigned the independent baltic states to the soviet sphere of influence .
with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalniete , a daughter of deportees , wants more coverage latvian member of parliament and former eu commissioner sandra kalniete was born in siberia after her parents were deported from their homeland .
" there is little knowledge about what really happened behind the iron curtain in the baltic states .
it needs to be brought to light and condemned , " she told dpa .
kalniete said she was encouraged by the fact that the events were being marked in european forums .
on march 23 at the opening of the european parliament 's strasbourg plenary session , the parliament 's president hans-gert poettering made a special declaration recalling the deportations .
" this is not a distant and obscure past ; it is still very much a living memory in the minds of many people who are citizens of the european union , " poettering said , describing condemnation of the soviets ' crimes as " our moral obligation and a fundamental duty as europeans . "
" it is important that the suffering endured by the victims is acknowledged at the european level , not just at the national level , " kalniete agreed .

" at the moment this situation has no effect on the role of the president of the european council , " he said in an eu presidency statement .
topolanek said he would offer his resignation , but that the government could stay in place in a caretaker capacity until the end of the eu presidency , in june .
eu leadership worries the toppling of topolanek 's coalition raised concerns over the czech republic 's ability to carry out the rest of its eu leadership term , at a time when the world 's largest trading bloc is going through its worst economic crisis in decades .
topolanek 's ousting precedes the g20 summit of world leaders in london as well as a special eu summit with us president barack obama in early april .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is more skeptical of the eu europe needs strong leadership in these times of crisis , " joseph daul , head of the center-right european people 's party , the largest parliamentary group in strasbourg , told afp .
" a government which assumes the eu presidency , but in which there is no confidence , can not assume this leadership , " he added .
fate of lisbon treaty even more uncertain the fall of the czech government also calls into question the future of the controversial lisbon treaty , which is meant to streamline the eu bureaucracy but was torpedoed by the irish in a referendum .
even the czechs have cast their doubts about the treaty and although the document has already been approved in the lower house of parliament , the upper senate has yet to ratify it . topolanek had strongly supported the treaty despite opposition from party backbenchers .
he had even once said , " if i lose control of the situation -lrb- in my party -rrb- , then the lisbon treaty will not pass . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech eu presidency ends in june , when sweden takes over on the other hand , czech president vaclav klaus , who has the power to appoint a new prime minister with parliamentary backing , refused to confirm whether he would give his blessing to the treaty . klaus ' hand could be strengthened if topolanek 's government is replaced by one that is more skeptical of eu political integration .
image of eu 's leadership hurt even before the czechs assumed the eu presidency , there had already been concerns in diplomatic circles about the ability of topolanek 's government , as opposed to heavy hitters like france 's nicolas sarkozy , who preceded him , to lead the bloc during a deep economic crisis .
europe 's big three - france , germany and britain - are viewed as the eu 's major powers .
their leadership carries more weight in foreign affairs than that of smaller countries such as the czech republic , which joined the bloc in 2004 .
but european leaders are worried about the eu 's leadership image .
" for the stability and image of europe , it is going to become more difficult , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
in practical terms , even left-leaning czech opposition leader jiri paroubek said in prague after the vote that it was " natural that the government would stay until the end of the eu presidency " on june 30 when sweden takes over the reins in leading the 27 nation bloc . df / jen / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" at the moment this situation has no effect on the role of the president of the european council , " he said in an eu presidency statement .
topolanek said he would offer his resignation , but that the government could stay in place in a caretaker capacity until the end of the eu presidency , in june .
eu leadership worries the toppling of topolanek 's coalition raised concerns over the czech republic 's ability to carry out the rest of its eu leadership term , at a time when the world 's largest trading bloc is going through its worst economic crisis in decades .
topolanek 's ousting precedes the g20 summit of world leaders in london as well as a special eu summit with us president barack obama in early april .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is more skeptical of the eu europe needs strong leadership in these times of crisis , " joseph daul , head of the center-right european people 's party , the largest parliamentary group in strasbourg , told afp .
" a government which assumes the eu presidency , but in which there is no confidence , can not assume this leadership , " he added .
fate of lisbon treaty even more uncertain the fall of the czech government also calls into question the future of the controversial lisbon treaty , which is meant to streamline the eu bureaucracy but was torpedoed by the irish in a referendum .
even the czechs have cast their doubts about the treaty and although the document has already been approved in the lower house of parliament , the upper senate has yet to ratify it . topolanek had strongly supported the treaty despite opposition from party backbenchers .
he had even once said , " if i lose control of the situation -lrb- in my party -rrb- , then the lisbon treaty will not pass . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech eu presidency ends in june , when sweden takes over on the other hand , czech president vaclav klaus , who has the power to appoint a new prime minister with parliamentary backing , refused to confirm whether he would give his blessing to the treaty . klaus ' hand could be strengthened if topolanek 's government is replaced by one that is more skeptical of eu political integration .
image of eu 's leadership hurt even before the czechs assumed the eu presidency , there had already been concerns in diplomatic circles about the ability of topolanek 's government , as opposed to heavy hitters like france 's nicolas sarkozy , who preceded him , to lead the bloc during a deep economic crisis .
europe 's big three - france , germany and britain - are viewed as the eu 's major powers .
their leadership carries more weight in foreign affairs than that of smaller countries such as the czech republic , which joined the bloc in 2004 .
but european leaders are worried about the eu 's leadership image .
" for the stability and image of europe , it is going to become more difficult , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
in practical terms , even left-leaning czech opposition leader jiri paroubek said in prague after the vote that it was " natural that the government would stay until the end of the eu presidency " on june 30 when sweden takes over the reins in leading the 27 nation bloc . df / jen / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for haarvald , that means he can ride horses in his free time . " on a sunday morning , i get up on a horse and go down by the beach - the sun has just come up , birds are flying , a seal is lying on the rock outside , " he says .

" i would have been a very bitter man when i would have come out of ringerike . " the prisoners of bastoy are fortunate to live in surroundings that many of norway 's prisoners would wish to appreciate during their sentences .
while prison staff believe they work in the best prison in the world , the jury is still out on whether time at bastoy is the catalyst for inmates putting a life of crime behind them for good . what is certain , though , is that the inmate islanders live in a unique prison .

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .

" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "

a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "
he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .
" we 're a laughing stock internationally with such ludicrous discussions , " said hans mommsen , 78 , a historian who is one of the moving forces behind the project to reproduce the annotated editions in an interview with dpa news agency .
" and when law enforcement officials are called in and the editor faces federal prosecution , it just reveals germany 's neurosis when it comes to nazism , " he said .
mommsen , who is a professor emeritus from ruhr university and has been a guest professor at american universities such as harvard , princeton and berkeley even argued that hitler 's mein kampf autobiography , which is readily accessible in other countries should also available to the german public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm highly dubious of this project " , said stephan kramer .
" in israel you can buy mein kampf in any book shop , but here it is still banned , " said mommsen .
" that creates a mythic aura for a book which , when read , reveals its banality from a to z. to this very day there is no annotated edition of that book in german , " he said .
german media divided about reprints the nazi newspaper replicas have also divided the german news media .
the national sueddeutsche zeitung said that readers were intelligent enough to see through the propaganda themselves .

a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "
he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .
" we 're a laughing stock internationally with such ludicrous discussions , " said hans mommsen , 78 , a historian who is one of the moving forces behind the project to reproduce the annotated editions in an interview with dpa news agency .
" and when law enforcement officials are called in and the editor faces federal prosecution , it just reveals germany 's neurosis when it comes to nazism , " he said .
mommsen , who is a professor emeritus from ruhr university and has been a guest professor at american universities such as harvard , princeton and berkeley even argued that hitler 's mein kampf autobiography , which is readily accessible in other countries should also available to the german public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm highly dubious of this project " , said stephan kramer .
" in israel you can buy mein kampf in any book shop , but here it is still banned , " said mommsen .
" that creates a mythic aura for a book which , when read , reveals its banality from a to z. to this very day there is no annotated edition of that book in german , " he said .
german media divided about reprints the nazi newspaper replicas have also divided the german news media .
the national sueddeutsche zeitung said that readers were intelligent enough to see through the propaganda themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 25.03.2009 munich court lifts ban on reprints of nazi-era newspapers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi newspaper replica contains historians ' annotations .
a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "
he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .
" we 're a laughing stock internationally with such ludicrous discussions , " said hans mommsen , 78 , a historian who is one of the moving forces behind the project to reproduce the annotated editions in an interview with dpa news agency .
" and when law enforcement officials are called in and the editor faces federal prosecution , it just reveals germany 's neurosis when it comes to nazism , " he said .
mommsen , who is a professor emeritus from ruhr university and has been a guest professor at american universities such as harvard , princeton and berkeley even argued that hitler 's mein kampf autobiography , which is readily accessible in other countries should also available to the german public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm highly dubious of this project " , said stephan kramer .
" in israel you can buy mein kampf in any book shop , but here it is still banned , " said mommsen .
" that creates a mythic aura for a book which , when read , reveals its banality from a to z. to this very day there is no annotated edition of that book in german , " he said .
german media divided about reprints the nazi newspaper replicas have also divided the german news media .
the national sueddeutsche zeitung said that readers were intelligent enough to see through the propaganda themselves .
" you flick through these old newspapers as anyone born long after the war might : in shock and amazement .
the evil -lrb- is right there -rrb- on paper , " the national daily wrote .
a local paper in lower saxony , the peiner allgemeine zeitung suggested that the publishers could be motivated by commercial interests .
" hitler sells better than sex , " the paper said . df / nda / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

daul is backed by socialists and the greens in parliament .

inmates there live and work in conditions that authorities hope will prepare them for a normal life after they get out . the only way to get to bastoy prison is to take the small prison ferry boat from the port of horten , about two hours south of oslo .
what was once a state institution for delinquent youths has now become the final stop for male inmates nearing the end of their sentences . but any similarities to rikers island in new york or the now defunct alcatraz in san francisco ends upon arrival .
bastoy looks like anything but a prison .
there are no high razor-wire fences , no concrete cell blocks and no watch towers .
instead , the small island looks more like a tranquil scandinavian health resort .
prisoners live in quaint wooden cottages overlooking pine forests , fields of wheat and inviting beaches . oyvind alnaes , the governor of bastoy , says that the prison is managed on ecological and humanist values . " we think that we have to treat the inmates in a proper way because they will open their ears and eyes and maybe are willing to learn something , " alnaes says .
" we use the ecological way of running this prison as a tool to learn responsibility and have concerns about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prisoner 's cottages must be maintained by the inmates themselves for the some 110 male inmates that begins on day one .
all new arrivals are trained how to cook , clean and look after themselves .
each inmate has his own space in the typical four-bedroom cottages . " but there are still inspections to come and see that you clean your room and make your bed , " inmate haarvald says .
" it should look like a normal room that you have at home in a normal life and the best thing is that they are all in a social environment . "
he says it gives the inmates the feeling that " they belong to society . " responsibility and leisure during the day , most inmates are employed in some form of livestock , farming or maintenance work .
haarvald works with the island 's six horses that are used for plowing and for transporting supplies .
twice a day , he has to go to the ferry and pick up goods .
some days , there is nothing to pick up and many other prisoners question why they even have to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking care of horses teach prisoners responsibility " as soon as you take the reins of the horse , you are training him and this is part of their responsibilities , " haarvald says .
" and here we 're talking about tough criminals - they get a responsibility and they can take it with them outside as a free man . " responsibilities at work also provide opportunities for leisure on the island .
for haarvald , that means he can ride horses in his free time . " on a sunday morning , i get up on a horse and go down by the beach - the sun has just come up , birds are flying , a seal is lying on the rock outside , " he says .
" you have to pinch your arm to remember where you are . " building trust for the 30 prison officers at bastoy , dialogue and trust with inmates is important .
officers and inmates call each other by their first names .
principal officer mia eklassens says bastoy makes a good place for inmates to end their sentences . " here we are trying to give you a great deal of trust and trying to work with you so that you are not going to prison again , " eklassens says .

but norway also has the full spectrum of jails , including maximum security facilities .
for george , one of the few foreign inmates on bastoy , serving out his sentence on the island is like leading a normal life compared to conditions he experienced in ringerike , norway 's maximum security prison . " that one was perhaps the toughest prison in the whole of norway because the way you are treated there in a way brings you down , " george says .
" i would have been a very bitter man when i would have come out of ringerike . " the prisoners of bastoy are fortunate to live in surroundings that many of norway 's prisoners would wish to appreciate during their sentences .
while prison staff believe they work in the best prison in the world , the jury is still out on whether time at bastoy is the catalyst for inmates putting a life of crime behind them for good . what is certain , though , is that the inmate islanders live in a unique prison .

mps were outraged that le pen continues to downplay nazi atrocities . the main groups in the eu parliament decided they would change the rules in order to keep le pen from taking on the honorary role of presiding over the european parliament 's opening session this summer .
joseph daul , head of the european people 's party - the biggest grouping in the parliament - said he would " do everything possible " to prevent le pen from taking the chair .
daul is backed by socialists and the greens in parliament .
le pen insists he 's the victim of " inflammatory accusations " by the parliamentary socialist group head , german european mp martin schulz , who had branded him a holocaust denier .
" i just said that the gas chambers were a detail of second world war history , which is clear , " he told a sitting of the european parliament in strasbourg , france on wednesday , march 25 .

back in 1987 , le pen was fined 1.2 million francs -lrb- 185,000 euros , $ 290,000 -rrb- for making remarks downplaying the holocaust in a radio interview .
" that proved the state we find the freedom of speech in europe and france , " he said , recalling the case .
parliament 's most senior member le pen was first elected to the european parliament in 1984 .
if he is elected at the top of the national front ticket , he would be granted the honor of presiding over the opening session of parliament due to his seniority and age .

us and european policymakers are standing behind the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
their comments followed a chinese bid to see the currency replaced by international monetary fund coinage . an upcoming global economic summit could turn into a showdown over the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
china has publicly thrown its support behind other emerging economies such as russia which want to shift the world 's currency away from the dollar to a new currency run by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" the outbreak of the crisis and its spillover to the entire world reflected the inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system , " people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said in a speech posted on the people 's bank of china 's web site .
analysts say zhou 's recent comments are the latest sign of the country 's growing assertiveness on the international stage .
they also show a growing concern china has over the $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.3 trillion euros -rrb- it holds in us treasury bonds and reserve dollars .
us , europe want dollar to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama does n't see the need for a global currency the united states and europe have dismissed the idea of doing away with the dollar as the international reserve currency .
the european union 's top economic official said he thinks the dollar will remain the world 's major reserve currency .
eu commissioner joaquin almunia said he does n't see " major structural changes in the role the dollar plays today as a major reserve currency . "
top us leaders , including president barack obama , said they want the dollar to keep its current status .
" i do n't believe there is a need for a global currency , " us president barack obama said at a press conference on tuesday .
he noted that " the dollar is extraordinarily strong right now , " and although the united states was " going through a rough patch " at present , the dollar enjoyed a " great deal of confidence " from investors .
both us treasury secretary timothy geithner and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said they would not support a plan to strip the dollar of its reserve status .
issue likely to be debated at g20 summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china would like to see the imf take a more prominent role yet the idea is likely to be floated anyway at an upcoming group of 20 summit planned for london in april .
the meeting of industrialized countries will bring together top leaders in hopes of finding a common approach to the global financial crisis .
people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said he would support moving away from the dollar to an imf currency basket that would include a mixture of dollars , euros , sterling and yen .
the imf already created an international reserve asset in 1969 , but the special drawing rights , as it is called , is currently used only by governments and international institutions .
russia has said it will bring up the proposal at the upcoming g20 meeting in london .
russia said its has broad support for its proposal among countries such as brazil , india , china , south korea and south africa .
not likely to happen anytime soon in the near-term , such a radical departure from the way the global financial system works would be near impossible , economists say , although it could be feasible in the long term .
" the arguments for doing such a thing have economic merit , though the actual implementation of such a system would likely take a herculean effort and a great deal of consensus building amongst economic powers , " sacha tihanyi , currency strategist with scotia capital told afp news agency .
" this is an idea , the idea of a global currency , determined by multilateral organizations , which is not new , but it 's a serious proposal , " john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , said at a news conference in response to a question about china 's proposal .
china growing more assertive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the biggest us creditor the recent comments by china 's top banker follows on comments made by china 's premier earlier this month .
they show how concerned the country is about its us assets .
" we have lent huge amounts of money to the united states .
of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets , " chinese premier wen jiabao said two weeks ago .
china holds us treasury bonds worth $ 739.6 billion as of january .
it is also the world 's largest holder of us dollars as a reserve currency , holding more than $ 1 trillion , according to us government figures .
" china appears to be growing more and more assertive over its rights , " currency analyst andrew busch of bmo capital markets told afp news agency .
the dollar , which was installed as the reserve currency after world war ii , has been regarded as a " safe haven " by international investors up to now . th / nda / afp / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.03.2009 us brewer loses eu-wide rights to budweiser name in court ruling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : battles over the budweiser name goes back nearly a century .
even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" at the moment this situation has no effect on the role of the president of the european council , " he said in an eu presidency statement .
topolanek said he would offer his resignation , but that the government could stay in place in a caretaker capacity until the end of the eu presidency , in june .
eu leadership worries the toppling of topolanek 's coalition raised concerns over the czech republic 's ability to carry out the rest of its eu leadership term , at a time when the world 's largest trading bloc is going through its worst economic crisis in decades .
topolanek 's ousting precedes the g20 summit of world leaders in london as well as a special eu summit with us president barack obama in early april .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is more skeptical of the eu europe needs strong leadership in these times of crisis , " joseph daul , head of the center-right european people 's party , the largest parliamentary group in strasbourg , told afp .
" a government which assumes the eu presidency , but in which there is no confidence , can not assume this leadership , " he added .
fate of lisbon treaty even more uncertain the fall of the czech government also calls into question the future of the controversial lisbon treaty , which is meant to streamline the eu bureaucracy but was torpedoed by the irish in a referendum .
even the czechs have cast their doubts about the treaty and although the document has already been approved in the lower house of parliament , the upper senate has yet to ratify it . topolanek had strongly supported the treaty despite opposition from party backbenchers .
he had even once said , " if i lose control of the situation -lrb- in my party -rrb- , then the lisbon treaty will not pass . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech eu presidency ends in june , when sweden takes over on the other hand , czech president vaclav klaus , who has the power to appoint a new prime minister with parliamentary backing , refused to confirm whether he would give his blessing to the treaty . klaus ' hand could be strengthened if topolanek 's government is replaced by one that is more skeptical of eu political integration .
image of eu 's leadership hurt even before the czechs assumed the eu presidency , there had already been concerns in diplomatic circles about the ability of topolanek 's government , as opposed to heavy hitters like france 's nicolas sarkozy , who preceded him , to lead the bloc during a deep economic crisis .
europe 's big three - france , germany and britain - are viewed as the eu 's major powers .
their leadership carries more weight in foreign affairs than that of smaller countries such as the czech republic , which joined the bloc in 2004 .
but european leaders are worried about the eu 's leadership image .
" for the stability and image of europe , it is going to become more difficult , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
in practical terms , even left-leaning czech opposition leader jiri paroubek said in prague after the vote that it was " natural that the government would stay until the end of the eu presidency " on june 30 when sweden takes over the reins in leading the 27 nation bloc . df / jen / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german invasion of russia delayed the first deportations a first wave of deportations of " enemies of the state " took place in 1941 but was interrupted by nazi germany 's invasion of russia , breaking the infamous molotov-ribbentrop pact which had consigned the independent baltic states to the soviet sphere of influence .
with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalniete , a daughter of deportees , wants more coverage latvian member of parliament and former eu commissioner sandra kalniete was born in siberia after her parents were deported from their homeland .
" there is little knowledge about what really happened behind the iron curtain in the baltic states .
it needs to be brought to light and condemned , " she told dpa .
kalniete said she was encouraged by the fact that the events were being marked in european forums .
on march 23 at the opening of the european parliament 's strasbourg plenary session , the parliament 's president hans-gert poettering made a special declaration recalling the deportations .
" this is not a distant and obscure past ; it is still very much a living memory in the minds of many people who are citizens of the european union , " poettering said , describing condemnation of the soviets ' crimes as " our moral obligation and a fundamental duty as europeans . "
" it is important that the suffering endured by the victims is acknowledged at the european level , not just at the national level , " kalniete agreed .
" my parents were deported , and my grandparents perished in siberia .

" we are living through a time of global economic challenges that can not be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation , " obama wrote in an opinion article published in more than two dozen leading global newspapers on tuesday , march 24 .
obama 's media outreach was matched by british prime minister gordon brown , who will host the upcoming g20 meeting .
brown embarked on a world tour to try and drum up international support for economic stimulus measures and reforms .
europe wary on stimulus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has held back on further stimulus measures european governments , particularly france and germany , have been cool to obama 's calls for additional stimulus measures .

instead , many european leaders want to see tougher regulation of financial institutions .
" -lrb- we need -rrb- coordination at all levels , no loopholes , no black holes , " french economics minister christine lagarde told a financial conference in prague tuesday in a taped video message .
us will outline reform plans this week obama agreed that more regulation is needed .
" if we continue to let financial institutions around the world act recklessly and irresponsibly , we will remain trapped in a cycle of bubble and bust , " obama wrote in his newspaper piece .
us treasury secretary timothy geithner is expected to unveil the government 's plans for regulatory reform on thursday , the white house said .
geithner said he supports far-reaching regulatory reform .
" all institutions and markets that could pose systemic risk will be subject to strong oversight , including appropriate constraints on risk taking , " geithner recently told a congressional committee .
obama 's media outreach came one day after geithner announced a public-private plan that will take over $ 1 trillion in so-called toxic bank assets .

brown called for more regulation of the financial markets and more coordinated stimulus of world economies in a speech before the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" regulatory standards should be set across europe and the world , " he said .
" worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to the economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries . "
europe and american need to work more closely , brown added , noting that he spoke with obama about the need for cooperation on monday .
" never in recent years have we had an american leadership so keen on working closely with europe . "

" at the moment this situation has no effect on the role of the president of the european council , " he said in an eu presidency statement .
topolanek said he would offer his resignation , but that the government could stay in place in a caretaker capacity until the end of the eu presidency , in june .
eu leadership worries the toppling of topolanek 's coalition raised concerns over the czech republic 's ability to carry out the rest of its eu leadership term , at a time when the world 's largest trading bloc is going through its worst economic crisis in decades .
topolanek 's ousting precedes the g20 summit of world leaders in london as well as a special eu summit with us president barack obama in early april .

" we are living through a time of global economic challenges that can not be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation , " obama wrote in an opinion article published in more than two dozen leading global newspapers on tuesday , march 24 .
obama 's media outreach was matched by british prime minister gordon brown , who will host the upcoming g20 meeting .
brown embarked on a world tour to try and drum up international support for economic stimulus measures and reforms .
europe wary on stimulus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has held back on further stimulus measures european governments , particularly france and germany , have been cool to obama 's calls for additional stimulus measures .
at last week 's eu summit in brussels , leaders of the 27-member bloc rejected recent us calls to extend the size of their 400-billion-euro -lrb- $ 544-billion -rrb- stimulus package .
instead , many european leaders want to see tougher regulation of financial institutions .
" -lrb- we need -rrb- coordination at all levels , no loopholes , no black holes , " french economics minister christine lagarde told a financial conference in prague tuesday in a taped video message .
us will outline reform plans this week obama agreed that more regulation is needed .
" if we continue to let financial institutions around the world act recklessly and irresponsibly , we will remain trapped in a cycle of bubble and bust , " obama wrote in his newspaper piece .
us treasury secretary timothy geithner is expected to unveil the government 's plans for regulatory reform on thursday , the white house said .
geithner said he supports far-reaching regulatory reform .
" all institutions and markets that could pose systemic risk will be subject to strong oversight , including appropriate constraints on risk taking , " geithner recently told a congressional committee .
obama 's media outreach came one day after geithner announced a public-private plan that will take over $ 1 trillion in so-called toxic bank assets .
gordon seeks international consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he wants more financial regulations britain 's brown is taking his message that both stimulus and regulatory measures are necessary on a world tour .
brown called for more regulation of the financial markets and more coordinated stimulus of world economies in a speech before the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" regulatory standards should be set across europe and the world , " he said .
" worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to the economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries . "
europe and american need to work more closely , brown added , noting that he spoke with obama about the need for cooperation on monday .
" never in recent years have we had an american leadership so keen on working closely with europe . "
brown will fly to new york for a meeting with un secretary-general ban ki-moon and then to latin america for talks in brazil and chile . th / nda / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german invasion of russia delayed the first deportations a first wave of deportations of " enemies of the state " took place in 1941 but was interrupted by nazi germany 's invasion of russia , breaking the infamous molotov-ribbentrop pact which had consigned the independent baltic states to the soviet sphere of influence .
with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .

it needs to be brought to light and condemned , " she told dpa .
kalniete said she was encouraged by the fact that the events were being marked in european forums .
on march 23 at the opening of the european parliament 's strasbourg plenary session , the parliament 's president hans-gert poettering made a special declaration recalling the deportations .

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german invasion of russia delayed the first deportations a first wave of deportations of " enemies of the state " took place in 1941 but was interrupted by nazi germany 's invasion of russia , breaking the infamous molotov-ribbentrop pact which had consigned the independent baltic states to the soviet sphere of influence .
with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalniete , a daughter of deportees , wants more coverage latvian member of parliament and former eu commissioner sandra kalniete was born in siberia after her parents were deported from their homeland .
" there is little knowledge about what really happened behind the iron curtain in the baltic states .
it needs to be brought to light and condemned , " she told dpa .
kalniete said she was encouraged by the fact that the events were being marked in european forums .
on march 23 at the opening of the european parliament 's strasbourg plenary session , the parliament 's president hans-gert poettering made a special declaration recalling the deportations .
" this is not a distant and obscure past ; it is still very much a living memory in the minds of many people who are citizens of the european union , " poettering said , describing condemnation of the soviets ' crimes as " our moral obligation and a fundamental duty as europeans . "
" it is important that the suffering endured by the victims is acknowledged at the european level , not just at the national level , " kalniete agreed .

but jogi wants to keep his options open . the head of the german soccer federation gave the national team coach the kind of job multi-year job guarantee most german employees could only dream of . " there 's no cause at the moment to think about any other solutions , " zwanziger told german press agency dpa on wednesday , march 25 , when asked about possible replacements for the men 's team coach . loew has said he wants to wait until germany has qualified for south africa before considering extending his contract beyond 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will jogi be watching over the national team after 2010 ?
" when he thinks the time is right to talk about these things then we will certainly do so , " zwanziger said .
the dfb boss said he was not only " highly satisfied " with loew 's work as coach but had a high regard for him as a person . discussions about the future of national team manager oliver bierhoff are also ongoing .
the former international striker 's name is often mentioned in connection with managerial posts in the bundesliga .
his contract with the national team ends in 2010 . " what i do will be clear in the summer , " biefhoff told the daily express .
" one year notice is more than enough . " qualifier training begins the germany squad meanwhile met for training in leipzig , ahead of saturday 's group 4 world cup qualifier against liechtenstein . germany is hoping that a solid performance wednesday will help the team put an end to months of internal turmoil after captain michael ballack publically criticized loew 's treatment of veteran players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hope to hop along wtih a pair of wins " if the team plays well against liechtenstein and wales and delivers the six points , i expect issues which have been discussed in the past will quickly become a topic no more , " zwanziger told the sport bild newspaper , referring to last year 's spat . injuries leave loew without three members of his 21-man squad : goalkeeper rene adler , defender per mertesacker and midfielder piotr trochowski .
midfielder torsten frings and striker miroslav klose have also dropped out of the squad with injuries . the fitness tests in leipzig come after two home defeats to england and norway and some 18 months after the germany squad took part in a similar fitness check . " this is a stocktaking a year before the world cup in south africa , " loew said of the tests which among other things included sprint , stamina and reaction checks .
" we want to see where players need to work in physical areas .
we have to work where we see the need .
we ca n't stay still . " loew has highlighted perceived deficiencies in the german game , saying teams in england and spain were playing faster football than in the bundesliga . after the match against liechtenstein , the germans will travel to cardiff to meet wales on wednesday .

" we are living through a time of global economic challenges that can not be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation , " obama wrote in an opinion article published in more than two dozen leading global newspapers on tuesday , march 24 .
obama 's media outreach was matched by british prime minister gordon brown , who will host the upcoming g20 meeting .
brown embarked on a world tour to try and drum up international support for economic stimulus measures and reforms .
europe wary on stimulus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has held back on further stimulus measures european governments , particularly france and germany , have been cool to obama 's calls for additional stimulus measures .
at last week 's eu summit in brussels , leaders of the 27-member bloc rejected recent us calls to extend the size of their 400-billion-euro -lrb- $ 544-billion -rrb- stimulus package .
instead , many european leaders want to see tougher regulation of financial institutions .
" -lrb- we need -rrb- coordination at all levels , no loopholes , no black holes , " french economics minister christine lagarde told a financial conference in prague tuesday in a taped video message .
us will outline reform plans this week obama agreed that more regulation is needed .
" if we continue to let financial institutions around the world act recklessly and irresponsibly , we will remain trapped in a cycle of bubble and bust , " obama wrote in his newspaper piece .
us treasury secretary timothy geithner is expected to unveil the government 's plans for regulatory reform on thursday , the white house said .
geithner said he supports far-reaching regulatory reform .
" all institutions and markets that could pose systemic risk will be subject to strong oversight , including appropriate constraints on risk taking , " geithner recently told a congressional committee .
obama 's media outreach came one day after geithner announced a public-private plan that will take over $ 1 trillion in so-called toxic bank assets .
gordon seeks international consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he wants more financial regulations britain 's brown is taking his message that both stimulus and regulatory measures are necessary on a world tour .
brown called for more regulation of the financial markets and more coordinated stimulus of world economies in a speech before the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" regulatory standards should be set across europe and the world , " he said .
" worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to the economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries . "
europe and american need to work more closely , brown added , noting that he spoke with obama about the need for cooperation on monday .
" never in recent years have we had an american leadership so keen on working closely with europe . "
brown will fly to new york for a meeting with un secretary-general ban ki-moon and then to latin america for talks in brazil and chile . th / nda / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bastoy looks like anything but a prison .
there are no high razor-wire fences , no concrete cell blocks and no watch towers .
instead , the small island looks more like a tranquil scandinavian health resort .
prisoners live in quaint wooden cottages overlooking pine forests , fields of wheat and inviting beaches . oyvind alnaes , the governor of bastoy , says that the prison is managed on ecological and humanist values . " we think that we have to treat the inmates in a proper way because they will open their ears and eyes and maybe are willing to learn something , " alnaes says .
" we use the ecological way of running this prison as a tool to learn responsibility and have concerns about the future .

all new arrivals are trained how to cook , clean and look after themselves .
each inmate has his own space in the typical four-bedroom cottages . " but there are still inspections to come and see that you clean your room and make your bed , " inmate haarvald says .
" it should look like a normal room that you have at home in a normal life and the best thing is that they are all in a social environment . "
he says it gives the inmates the feeling that " they belong to society . " responsibility and leisure during the day , most inmates are employed in some form of livestock , farming or maintenance work .
haarvald works with the island 's six horses that are used for plowing and for transporting supplies .
twice a day , he has to go to the ferry and pick up goods .
some days , there is nothing to pick up and many other prisoners question why they even have to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking care of horses teach prisoners responsibility " as soon as you take the reins of the horse , you are training him and this is part of their responsibilities , " haarvald says .
" and here we 're talking about tough criminals - they get a responsibility and they can take it with them outside as a free man . " responsibilities at work also provide opportunities for leisure on the island .
for haarvald , that means he can ride horses in his free time . " on a sunday morning , i get up on a horse and go down by the beach - the sun has just come up , birds are flying , a seal is lying on the rock outside , " he says .
" you have to pinch your arm to remember where you are . " building trust for the 30 prison officers at bastoy , dialogue and trust with inmates is important .

principal officer mia eklassens says bastoy makes a good place for inmates to end their sentences . " here we are trying to give you a great deal of trust and trying to work with you so that you are not going to prison again , " eklassens says .
" we 're trying to give the prisoners some sense of pride in what he has accomplished while he is here .

but norway also has the full spectrum of jails , including maximum security facilities .
for george , one of the few foreign inmates on bastoy , serving out his sentence on the island is like leading a normal life compared to conditions he experienced in ringerike , norway 's maximum security prison . " that one was perhaps the toughest prison in the whole of norway because the way you are treated there in a way brings you down , " george says .
" i would have been a very bitter man when i would have come out of ringerike . " the prisoners of bastoy are fortunate to live in surroundings that many of norway 's prisoners would wish to appreciate during their sentences .
while prison staff believe they work in the best prison in the world , the jury is still out on whether time at bastoy is the catalyst for inmates putting a life of crime behind them for good . what is certain , though , is that the inmate islanders live in a unique prison .

inmates there live and work in conditions that authorities hope will prepare them for a normal life after they get out . the only way to get to bastoy prison is to take the small prison ferry boat from the port of horten , about two hours south of oslo .
what was once a state institution for delinquent youths has now become the final stop for male inmates nearing the end of their sentences . but any similarities to rikers island in new york or the now defunct alcatraz in san francisco ends upon arrival .
bastoy looks like anything but a prison .
there are no high razor-wire fences , no concrete cell blocks and no watch towers .
instead , the small island looks more like a tranquil scandinavian health resort .
prisoners live in quaint wooden cottages overlooking pine forests , fields of wheat and inviting beaches . oyvind alnaes , the governor of bastoy , says that the prison is managed on ecological and humanist values . " we think that we have to treat the inmates in a proper way because they will open their ears and eyes and maybe are willing to learn something , " alnaes says .
" we use the ecological way of running this prison as a tool to learn responsibility and have concerns about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prisoner 's cottages must be maintained by the inmates themselves for the some 110 male inmates that begins on day one .
all new arrivals are trained how to cook , clean and look after themselves .
each inmate has his own space in the typical four-bedroom cottages . " but there are still inspections to come and see that you clean your room and make your bed , " inmate haarvald says .
" it should look like a normal room that you have at home in a normal life and the best thing is that they are all in a social environment . "
he says it gives the inmates the feeling that " they belong to society . " responsibility and leisure during the day , most inmates are employed in some form of livestock , farming or maintenance work .
haarvald works with the island 's six horses that are used for plowing and for transporting supplies .
twice a day , he has to go to the ferry and pick up goods .
some days , there is nothing to pick up and many other prisoners question why they even have to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking care of horses teach prisoners responsibility " as soon as you take the reins of the horse , you are training him and this is part of their responsibilities , " haarvald says .
" and here we 're talking about tough criminals - they get a responsibility and they can take it with them outside as a free man . " responsibilities at work also provide opportunities for leisure on the island .
for haarvald , that means he can ride horses in his free time . " on a sunday morning , i get up on a horse and go down by the beach - the sun has just come up , birds are flying , a seal is lying on the rock outside , " he says .
" you have to pinch your arm to remember where you are . " building trust for the 30 prison officers at bastoy , dialogue and trust with inmates is important .
officers and inmates call each other by their first names .
principal officer mia eklassens says bastoy makes a good place for inmates to end their sentences . " here we are trying to give you a great deal of trust and trying to work with you so that you are not going to prison again , " eklassens says .

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german invasion of russia delayed the first deportations a first wave of deportations of " enemies of the state " took place in 1941 but was interrupted by nazi germany 's invasion of russia , breaking the infamous molotov-ribbentrop pact which had consigned the independent baltic states to the soviet sphere of influence .
with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalniete , a daughter of deportees , wants more coverage latvian member of parliament and former eu commissioner sandra kalniete was born in siberia after her parents were deported from their homeland .
" there is little knowledge about what really happened behind the iron curtain in the baltic states .
it needs to be brought to light and condemned , " she told dpa .
kalniete said she was encouraged by the fact that the events were being marked in european forums .
on march 23 at the opening of the european parliament 's strasbourg plenary session , the parliament 's president hans-gert poettering made a special declaration recalling the deportations .
" this is not a distant and obscure past ; it is still very much a living memory in the minds of many people who are citizens of the european union , " poettering said , describing condemnation of the soviets ' crimes as " our moral obligation and a fundamental duty as europeans . "
" it is important that the suffering endured by the victims is acknowledged at the european level , not just at the national level , " kalniete agreed .
" my parents were deported , and my grandparents perished in siberia .
i will be marking the day by laying flowers at the latvian freedom monument . " nda / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are living through a time of global economic challenges that can not be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation , " obama wrote in an opinion article published in more than two dozen leading global newspapers on tuesday , march 24 .
obama 's media outreach was matched by british prime minister gordon brown , who will host the upcoming g20 meeting .
brown embarked on a world tour to try and drum up international support for economic stimulus measures and reforms .
europe wary on stimulus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has held back on further stimulus measures european governments , particularly france and germany , have been cool to obama 's calls for additional stimulus measures .
at last week 's eu summit in brussels , leaders of the 27-member bloc rejected recent us calls to extend the size of their 400-billion-euro -lrb- $ 544-billion -rrb- stimulus package .
instead , many european leaders want to see tougher regulation of financial institutions .
" -lrb- we need -rrb- coordination at all levels , no loopholes , no black holes , " french economics minister christine lagarde told a financial conference in prague tuesday in a taped video message .
us will outline reform plans this week obama agreed that more regulation is needed .
" if we continue to let financial institutions around the world act recklessly and irresponsibly , we will remain trapped in a cycle of bubble and bust , " obama wrote in his newspaper piece .
us treasury secretary timothy geithner is expected to unveil the government 's plans for regulatory reform on thursday , the white house said .
geithner said he supports far-reaching regulatory reform .
" all institutions and markets that could pose systemic risk will be subject to strong oversight , including appropriate constraints on risk taking , " geithner recently told a congressional committee .
obama 's media outreach came one day after geithner announced a public-private plan that will take over $ 1 trillion in so-called toxic bank assets .
gordon seeks international consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he wants more financial regulations britain 's brown is taking his message that both stimulus and regulatory measures are necessary on a world tour .
brown called for more regulation of the financial markets and more coordinated stimulus of world economies in a speech before the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" regulatory standards should be set across europe and the world , " he said .
" worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to the economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries . "
europe and american need to work more closely , brown added , noting that he spoke with obama about the need for cooperation on monday .
" never in recent years have we had an american leadership so keen on working closely with europe . "
brown will fly to new york for a meeting with un secretary-general ban ki-moon and then to latin america for talks in brazil and chile . th / nda / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expecting thousands of nato protestors german authorities have said they expect about 25,000 demonstrators to show up for the nato summit , which will be held in the towns of baden-baden and kehl in germany and strasbourg in france .
germany will provide 600 soldiers and 15,000 police to guard the 3,500 delegates from attacks , germany has said .
germany and nato will also deploy warplanes and surveillance aircraft to patrol the airspace .

if the proposals are approved by parliament and implemented , anyone trying to access specific web sites will find an empty screen or be redirected to a stop sign .
internet porn the start of a slippery slope , claims minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen warned of the " entry drug " of porn according to the german government 's family minister ursula von der leyen , the ready availability of internet child pornography acts as a form of " entry drug “ for many pedophiles . once established , the addiction can lead to more violent forms of behavior such as abduction , rape and murder .
although the new measures have been welcomed by the federal telecommunications association bitkom , the association 's managing director bernhard rohleder warned against expecting the problems of internet child pornography to be solved once and for all . barring access to certain web sites was a useful measure , he said , as it would reduce the number of chance " hits “ to web sites hosting images of child pornography .
but rohleder added that the proposed new measures would have a limited effect as pedophiles intent on gaining access to child pornography would find ways to feed their habit by taking measures such as concealing the internet address of their home computers . commercial child pornography web sites are also unlikely to be affected by the proposed new law as most of them are accessed through so-called " peer-to-peer " servers , which internet service providers are powerless to control .
eu follows with new protection proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot called for standardized legislation across the eu meanwhile , the european commission today unveiled new proposals to clamp down on child pornography , child sex tourism and human trafficking .
speaking in brussels this morning , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot called for standardizing legislation on sex crimes against children throughout the eu 's 27 member states . " when we speak about child sexual abuse and sexual exploitation , we are speaking about horrendous crimes against children that leave deep scars and suffering for their whole lives , " barrot said .
the eu said it needs to improve cooperation with non-european countries to go after child pornographers and traffickers who operate outside the bloc .
as well as pushing for eu-wide rules on human trafficking , the commission also wants sex tourists to face prosecution when they return to the eu .
the eu also said it plans to work with credit card companies to prevent child pornography from being purchased on the internet . ml / th / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but jogi wants to keep his options open . the head of the german soccer federation gave the national team coach the kind of job multi-year job guarantee most german employees could only dream of . " there 's no cause at the moment to think about any other solutions , " zwanziger told german press agency dpa on wednesday , march 25 , when asked about possible replacements for the men 's team coach . loew has said he wants to wait until germany has qualified for south africa before considering extending his contract beyond 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will jogi be watching over the national team after 2010 ?
" when he thinks the time is right to talk about these things then we will certainly do so , " zwanziger said .
the dfb boss said he was not only " highly satisfied " with loew 's work as coach but had a high regard for him as a person . discussions about the future of national team manager oliver bierhoff are also ongoing .
the former international striker 's name is often mentioned in connection with managerial posts in the bundesliga .
his contract with the national team ends in 2010 . " what i do will be clear in the summer , " biefhoff told the daily express .
" one year notice is more than enough . " qualifier training begins the germany squad meanwhile met for training in leipzig , ahead of saturday 's group 4 world cup qualifier against liechtenstein . germany is hoping that a solid performance wednesday will help the team put an end to months of internal turmoil after captain michael ballack publically criticized loew 's treatment of veteran players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hope to hop along wtih a pair of wins " if the team plays well against liechtenstein and wales and delivers the six points , i expect issues which have been discussed in the past will quickly become a topic no more , " zwanziger told the sport bild newspaper , referring to last year 's spat . injuries leave loew without three members of his 21-man squad : goalkeeper rene adler , defender per mertesacker and midfielder piotr trochowski .
midfielder torsten frings and striker miroslav klose have also dropped out of the squad with injuries . the fitness tests in leipzig come after two home defeats to england and norway and some 18 months after the germany squad took part in a similar fitness check . " this is a stocktaking a year before the world cup in south africa , " loew said of the tests which among other things included sprint , stamina and reaction checks .
" we want to see where players need to work in physical areas .
we have to work where we see the need .
we ca n't stay still . " loew has highlighted perceived deficiencies in the german game , saying teams in england and spain were playing faster football than in the bundesliga . after the match against liechtenstein , the germans will travel to cardiff to meet wales on wednesday .

mps were outraged that le pen continues to downplay nazi atrocities . the main groups in the eu parliament decided they would change the rules in order to keep le pen from taking on the honorary role of presiding over the european parliament 's opening session this summer .
joseph daul , head of the european people 's party - the biggest grouping in the parliament - said he would " do everything possible " to prevent le pen from taking the chair .
daul is backed by socialists and the greens in parliament .
le pen insists he 's the victim of " inflammatory accusations " by the parliamentary socialist group head , german european mp martin schulz , who had branded him a holocaust denier .
" i just said that the gas chambers were a detail of second world war history , which is clear , " he told a sitting of the european parliament in strasbourg , france on wednesday , march 25 .
some six million jews were killed during the holocaust .
past convictions for racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen was supposed to preside over the eu parliament le pen , 80 , has several past convictions for racism and anti-semitism .
he shocked europe in 2002 when he placed second in the french presidential elections .
he won 10 percent of votes in the 2007 presidential race .
back in 1987 , le pen was fined 1.2 million francs -lrb- 185,000 euros , $ 290,000 -rrb- for making remarks downplaying the holocaust in a radio interview .
" that proved the state we find the freedom of speech in europe and france , " he said , recalling the case .
parliament 's most senior member le pen was first elected to the european parliament in 1984 .
if he is elected at the top of the national front ticket , he would be granted the honor of presiding over the opening session of parliament due to his seniority and age .
" i am concerned by the fact that a holocaust denier could preside over the opening session of the european parliament , " schulz had said previously .

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expecting thousands of nato protestors german authorities have said they expect about 25,000 demonstrators to show up for the nato summit , which will be held in the towns of baden-baden and kehl in germany and strasbourg in france .
germany will provide 600 soldiers and 15,000 police to guard the 3,500 delegates from attacks , germany has said .

" at the moment this situation has no effect on the role of the president of the european council , " he said in an eu presidency statement .
topolanek said he would offer his resignation , but that the government could stay in place in a caretaker capacity until the end of the eu presidency , in june .
eu leadership worries the toppling of topolanek 's coalition raised concerns over the czech republic 's ability to carry out the rest of its eu leadership term , at a time when the world 's largest trading bloc is going through its worst economic crisis in decades .
topolanek 's ousting precedes the g20 summit of world leaders in london as well as a special eu summit with us president barack obama in early april .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is more skeptical of the eu europe needs strong leadership in these times of crisis , " joseph daul , head of the center-right european people 's party , the largest parliamentary group in strasbourg , told afp .
" a government which assumes the eu presidency , but in which there is no confidence , can not assume this leadership , " he added .
fate of lisbon treaty even more uncertain the fall of the czech government also calls into question the future of the controversial lisbon treaty , which is meant to streamline the eu bureaucracy but was torpedoed by the irish in a referendum .
even the czechs have cast their doubts about the treaty and although the document has already been approved in the lower house of parliament , the upper senate has yet to ratify it . topolanek had strongly supported the treaty despite opposition from party backbenchers .
he had even once said , " if i lose control of the situation -lrb- in my party -rrb- , then the lisbon treaty will not pass . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech eu presidency ends in june , when sweden takes over on the other hand , czech president vaclav klaus , who has the power to appoint a new prime minister with parliamentary backing , refused to confirm whether he would give his blessing to the treaty . klaus ' hand could be strengthened if topolanek 's government is replaced by one that is more skeptical of eu political integration .
image of eu 's leadership hurt even before the czechs assumed the eu presidency , there had already been concerns in diplomatic circles about the ability of topolanek 's government , as opposed to heavy hitters like france 's nicolas sarkozy , who preceded him , to lead the bloc during a deep economic crisis .
europe 's big three - france , germany and britain - are viewed as the eu 's major powers .
their leadership carries more weight in foreign affairs than that of smaller countries such as the czech republic , which joined the bloc in 2004 .
but european leaders are worried about the eu 's leadership image .
" for the stability and image of europe , it is going to become more difficult , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
in practical terms , even left-leaning czech opposition leader jiri paroubek said in prague after the vote that it was " natural that the government would stay until the end of the eu presidency " on june 30 when sweden takes over the reins in leading the 27 nation bloc . df / jen / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .

a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "

a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "
he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .
" we 're a laughing stock internationally with such ludicrous discussions , " said hans mommsen , 78 , a historian who is one of the moving forces behind the project to reproduce the annotated editions in an interview with dpa news agency .
" and when law enforcement officials are called in and the editor faces federal prosecution , it just reveals germany 's neurosis when it comes to nazism , " he said .
mommsen , who is a professor emeritus from ruhr university and has been a guest professor at american universities such as harvard , princeton and berkeley even argued that hitler 's mein kampf autobiography , which is readily accessible in other countries should also available to the german public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm highly dubious of this project " , said stephan kramer .
" in israel you can buy mein kampf in any book shop , but here it is still banned , " said mommsen .
" that creates a mythic aura for a book which , when read , reveals its banality from a to z. to this very day there is no annotated edition of that book in german , " he said .
german media divided about reprints the nazi newspaper replicas have also divided the german news media .
the national sueddeutsche zeitung said that readers were intelligent enough to see through the propaganda themselves .

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expecting thousands of nato protestors german authorities have said they expect about 25,000 demonstrators to show up for the nato summit , which will be held in the towns of baden-baden and kehl in germany and strasbourg in france .

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expecting thousands of nato protestors german authorities have said they expect about 25,000 demonstrators to show up for the nato summit , which will be held in the towns of baden-baden and kehl in germany and strasbourg in france .
germany will provide 600 soldiers and 15,000 police to guard the 3,500 delegates from attacks , germany has said .
germany and nato will also deploy warplanes and surveillance aircraft to patrol the airspace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 25.03.2009 munich court lifts ban on reprints of nazi-era newspapers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi newspaper replica contains historians ' annotations .
a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "
he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .
" we 're a laughing stock internationally with such ludicrous discussions , " said hans mommsen , 78 , a historian who is one of the moving forces behind the project to reproduce the annotated editions in an interview with dpa news agency .
" and when law enforcement officials are called in and the editor faces federal prosecution , it just reveals germany 's neurosis when it comes to nazism , " he said .
mommsen , who is a professor emeritus from ruhr university and has been a guest professor at american universities such as harvard , princeton and berkeley even argued that hitler 's mein kampf autobiography , which is readily accessible in other countries should also available to the german public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm highly dubious of this project " , said stephan kramer .
" in israel you can buy mein kampf in any book shop , but here it is still banned , " said mommsen .
" that creates a mythic aura for a book which , when read , reveals its banality from a to z. to this very day there is no annotated edition of that book in german , " he said .
german media divided about reprints the nazi newspaper replicas have also divided the german news media .
the national sueddeutsche zeitung said that readers were intelligent enough to see through the propaganda themselves .
" you flick through these old newspapers as anyone born long after the war might : in shock and amazement .
the evil -lrb- is right there -rrb- on paper , " the national daily wrote .
a local paper in lower saxony , the peiner allgemeine zeitung suggested that the publishers could be motivated by commercial interests .

after all , what party members have perceived is likely to be very clear to the public : barak and the center-left party are more interested in saving themselves and their careers than in morals . barak , of course , is not prepared to make such an admission .
it would mean he would have to contradict himself , since on election day he spoke about joining the opposition .
now he emphasizes that he 's not afraid of netanyahu and that he will serve as a counterbalance to extreme right positions .
as a partner in the coalition he could achieve more than as a 13-member party in the opposition . that may well be , but what can barak achieve in such a government ?
there 's the prime minister who , during campaigning , broke off from restarting the peace process .
the likely foreign minster , avigdor lieberman , has threatened to bomb egypt 's aswan dam ; he sees israeli-arabs as potential enemies in their own country ; and he would prefer attacking iran sooner rather than later .
and there are orthodox coalition partners , primarily concerned with improving the economic and social position of religion in israel . in short , problems and conflicts are preprogrammed both domestically and internationally . the european union has already begun grumbling that it would not be able to work with a far-right government in jerusalem the same way it did with other governments .
washington is alarmed , and the position of hardliners in the arab world who say israel was never interested in peace is being strengthened . in light of this situation , talking about a " counterbalance in the coalition " is a sham .
barak will have to make one compromise after another to make sure other coalition partners do n't leave the government to force early elections .
people now , even in israel , are beginning to ask if barak is n't already camped on the right and wo n't actually have to make any concessions at all .
he will serves as a fig leaf for netanyahu and not as a corrective in the government . his decision is a disservice to his own party , and , more importantly , to hopes for peace . peter philipp is dw 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . author : peter philipp / jen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inmates there live and work in conditions that authorities hope will prepare them for a normal life after they get out . the only way to get to bastoy prison is to take the small prison ferry boat from the port of horten , about two hours south of oslo .
what was once a state institution for delinquent youths has now become the final stop for male inmates nearing the end of their sentences . but any similarities to rikers island in new york or the now defunct alcatraz in san francisco ends upon arrival .
bastoy looks like anything but a prison .
there are no high razor-wire fences , no concrete cell blocks and no watch towers .
instead , the small island looks more like a tranquil scandinavian health resort .
prisoners live in quaint wooden cottages overlooking pine forests , fields of wheat and inviting beaches . oyvind alnaes , the governor of bastoy , says that the prison is managed on ecological and humanist values . " we think that we have to treat the inmates in a proper way because they will open their ears and eyes and maybe are willing to learn something , " alnaes says .
" we use the ecological way of running this prison as a tool to learn responsibility and have concerns about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prisoner 's cottages must be maintained by the inmates themselves for the some 110 male inmates that begins on day one .
all new arrivals are trained how to cook , clean and look after themselves .
each inmate has his own space in the typical four-bedroom cottages . " but there are still inspections to come and see that you clean your room and make your bed , " inmate haarvald says .
" it should look like a normal room that you have at home in a normal life and the best thing is that they are all in a social environment . "
he says it gives the inmates the feeling that " they belong to society . " responsibility and leisure during the day , most inmates are employed in some form of livestock , farming or maintenance work .
haarvald works with the island 's six horses that are used for plowing and for transporting supplies .
twice a day , he has to go to the ferry and pick up goods .
some days , there is nothing to pick up and many other prisoners question why they even have to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking care of horses teach prisoners responsibility " as soon as you take the reins of the horse , you are training him and this is part of their responsibilities , " haarvald says .
" and here we 're talking about tough criminals - they get a responsibility and they can take it with them outside as a free man . " responsibilities at work also provide opportunities for leisure on the island .
for haarvald , that means he can ride horses in his free time . " on a sunday morning , i get up on a horse and go down by the beach - the sun has just come up , birds are flying , a seal is lying on the rock outside , " he says .
" you have to pinch your arm to remember where you are . " building trust for the 30 prison officers at bastoy , dialogue and trust with inmates is important .
officers and inmates call each other by their first names .
principal officer mia eklassens says bastoy makes a good place for inmates to end their sentences . " here we are trying to give you a great deal of trust and trying to work with you so that you are not going to prison again , " eklassens says .
" we 're trying to give the prisoners some sense of pride in what he has accomplished while he is here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some prisoners are in charge of livestock in addition , the prison tries to help inmates deal with problems like drugs , violence and reconnecting with their families . " that 's why i think it 's a good place to serve your sentence , " eklassens says . special freedoms bastoy prison might function well as a liberal institution .
but norway also has the full spectrum of jails , including maximum security facilities .
for george , one of the few foreign inmates on bastoy , serving out his sentence on the island is like leading a normal life compared to conditions he experienced in ringerike , norway 's maximum security prison . " that one was perhaps the toughest prison in the whole of norway because the way you are treated there in a way brings you down , " george says .
" i would have been a very bitter man when i would have come out of ringerike . " the prisoners of bastoy are fortunate to live in surroundings that many of norway 's prisoners would wish to appreciate during their sentences .
while prison staff believe they work in the best prison in the world , the jury is still out on whether time at bastoy is the catalyst for inmates putting a life of crime behind them for good . what is certain , though , is that the inmate islanders live in a unique prison .
life is not a beach at bastoy but there is a chance for prisoners to enjoy a special kind of freedom and to regain responsibility over the lives . guy degen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .

with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalniete , a daughter of deportees , wants more coverage latvian member of parliament and former eu commissioner sandra kalniete was born in siberia after her parents were deported from their homeland .
" there is little knowledge about what really happened behind the iron curtain in the baltic states .
it needs to be brought to light and condemned , " she told dpa .
kalniete said she was encouraged by the fact that the events were being marked in european forums .
on march 23 at the opening of the european parliament 's strasbourg plenary session , the parliament 's president hans-gert poettering made a special declaration recalling the deportations .
" this is not a distant and obscure past ; it is still very much a living memory in the minds of many people who are citizens of the european union , " poettering said , describing condemnation of the soviets ' crimes as " our moral obligation and a fundamental duty as europeans . "

deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .

with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : doing time in europe interview : raising awareness on prison conditions britain suffering from prison overcrowding the prison everyone wants to stay in fashion is helping italian prisoners ' futures europe -pipe- 25.03.2009 norwegian prison prepares inmates for the outside world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastoy prison is based on an idyllic island the island of bastoy in the oslo fjord is one of europe 's most unusual prison facilities .
inmates there live and work in conditions that authorities hope will prepare them for a normal life after they get out . the only way to get to bastoy prison is to take the small prison ferry boat from the port of horten , about two hours south of oslo .
what was once a state institution for delinquent youths has now become the final stop for male inmates nearing the end of their sentences . but any similarities to rikers island in new york or the now defunct alcatraz in san francisco ends upon arrival .
bastoy looks like anything but a prison .
there are no high razor-wire fences , no concrete cell blocks and no watch towers .
instead , the small island looks more like a tranquil scandinavian health resort .
prisoners live in quaint wooden cottages overlooking pine forests , fields of wheat and inviting beaches . oyvind alnaes , the governor of bastoy , says that the prison is managed on ecological and humanist values . " we think that we have to treat the inmates in a proper way because they will open their ears and eyes and maybe are willing to learn something , " alnaes says .
" we use the ecological way of running this prison as a tool to learn responsibility and have concerns about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking care of horses teach prisoners responsibility for the some 110 male inmates that begins on day one .
all new arrivals are trained how to cook , clean and look after themselves .
each inmate has his own space in the typical four-bedroom cottages . " but there are still inspections to come and see that you clean your room and make your bed , " inmate haarvald says .
" it should look like a normal room that you have at home in a normal life and the best thing is that they are all in a social environment . "
he says it gives the inmates the feeling that " they belong to society . " responsibility and leisure during the day , most inmates are employed in some form of livestock , farming or maintenance work .
haarvald works with the island 's six horses that are used for plowing and for transporting supplies .
twice a day , he has to go to the ferry and pick up goods .
some days , there is nothing to pick up and many other prisoners question why they even have to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some prisoners are in charge of livestock " as soon as you take the reins of the horse , you are training him and this is part of their responsibilities , " haarvald says .
" and here we 're talking about tough criminals - they get a responsibility and they can take it with them outside as a free man . " responsibilities at work also provide opportunities for leisure on the island .
for haarvald , that means he can ride horses in his free time . " on a sunday morning , i get up on a horse and go down by the beach - the sun has just come up , birds are flying , a seal is lying on the rock outside , " he says .
" you have to pinch your arm to remember where you are . " building trust for the 30 prison officers at bastoy , dialogue and trust with inmates is important .
officers and inmates call each other by their first names .
principal officer mia eklassens says bastoy makes a good place for inmates to end their sentences . " here we are trying to give you a great deal of trust and trying to work with you so that you are not going to prison again , " eklassens says .
" we 're trying to give the prisoners some sense of pride in what he has accomplished while he is here . " # b # in addition , the prison tries to help inmates deal with problems like drugs , violence and reconnecting with their families . " that 's why i think it 's a good place to serve your sentence , " eklassens says . special freedoms bastoy prison might function well as a liberal institution .
but norway also has the full spectrum of jails , including maximum security facilities .
for george , one of the few foreign inmates on bastoy , serving out his sentence on the island is like leading a normal life compared to conditions he experienced in ringerike , norway 's maximum security prison . " that one was perhaps the toughest prison in the whole of norway because the way you are treated there in a way brings you down , " george says .
" i would have been a very bitter man when i would have come out of ringerike . " the prisoners of bastoy are fortunate to live in surroundings that many of norway 's prisoners would wish to appreciate during their sentences .
while prison staff believe they work in the best prison in the world , the jury is still out on whether time at bastoy is the catalyst for inmates putting a life of crime behind them for good . what is certain , though , is that the inmate islanders live in a unique prison .
life is not a beach at bastoy but there is a chance for prisoners to enjoy a special kind of freedom and to regain responsibility over the lives . guy degen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us and european policymakers are standing behind the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
their comments followed a chinese bid to see the currency replaced by international monetary fund coinage . an upcoming global economic summit could turn into a showdown over the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
china has publicly thrown its support behind other emerging economies such as russia which want to shift the world 's currency away from the dollar to a new currency run by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" the outbreak of the crisis and its spillover to the entire world reflected the inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system , " people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said in a speech posted on the people 's bank of china 's web site .
analysts say zhou 's recent comments are the latest sign of the country 's growing assertiveness on the international stage .
they also show a growing concern china has over the $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.3 trillion euros -rrb- it holds in us treasury bonds and reserve dollars .
us , europe want dollar to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama does n't see the need for a global currency the united states and europe have dismissed the idea of doing away with the dollar as the international reserve currency .
the european union 's top economic official said he thinks the dollar will remain the world 's major reserve currency .
eu commissioner joaquin almunia said he does n't see " major structural changes in the role the dollar plays today as a major reserve currency . "
top us leaders , including president barack obama , said they want the dollar to keep its current status .
" i do n't believe there is a need for a global currency , " us president barack obama said at a press conference on tuesday .
he noted that " the dollar is extraordinarily strong right now , " and although the united states was " going through a rough patch " at present , the dollar enjoyed a " great deal of confidence " from investors .
both us treasury secretary timothy geithner and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said they would not support a plan to strip the dollar of its reserve status .
issue likely to be debated at g20 summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china would like to see the imf take a more prominent role yet the idea is likely to be floated anyway at an upcoming group of 20 summit planned for london in april .
the meeting of industrialized countries will bring together top leaders in hopes of finding a common approach to the global financial crisis .
people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said he would support moving away from the dollar to an imf currency basket that would include a mixture of dollars , euros , sterling and yen .
the imf already created an international reserve asset in 1969 , but the special drawing rights , as it is called , is currently used only by governments and international institutions .
russia has said it will bring up the proposal at the upcoming g20 meeting in london .
russia said its has broad support for its proposal among countries such as brazil , india , china , south korea and south africa .
not likely to happen anytime soon in the near-term , such a radical departure from the way the global financial system works would be near impossible , economists say , although it could be feasible in the long term .
" the arguments for doing such a thing have economic merit , though the actual implementation of such a system would likely take a herculean effort and a great deal of consensus building amongst economic powers , " sacha tihanyi , currency strategist with scotia capital told afp news agency .
" this is an idea , the idea of a global currency , determined by multilateral organizations , which is not new , but it 's a serious proposal , " john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , said at a news conference in response to a question about china 's proposal .
china growing more assertive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the biggest us creditor the recent comments by china 's top banker follows on comments made by china 's premier earlier this month .
they show how concerned the country is about its us assets .
" we have lent huge amounts of money to the united states .
of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets , " chinese premier wen jiabao said two weeks ago .
china holds us treasury bonds worth $ 739.6 billion as of january .
it is also the world 's largest holder of us dollars as a reserve currency , holding more than $ 1 trillion , according to us government figures .
" china appears to be growing more and more assertive over its rights , " currency analyst andrew busch of bmo capital markets told afp news agency .

us , europe want dollar to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama does n't see the need for a global currency the united states and europe have dismissed the idea of doing away with the dollar as the international reserve currency .
the european union 's top economic official said he thinks the dollar will remain the world 's major reserve currency .
eu commissioner joaquin almunia said he does n't see " major structural changes in the role the dollar plays today as a major reserve currency . "
top us leaders , including president barack obama , said they want the dollar to keep its current status .
" i do n't believe there is a need for a global currency , " us president barack obama said at a press conference on tuesday .
he noted that " the dollar is extraordinarily strong right now , " and although the united states was " going through a rough patch " at present , the dollar enjoyed a " great deal of confidence " from investors .
both us treasury secretary timothy geithner and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said they would not support a plan to strip the dollar of its reserve status .
issue likely to be debated at g20 summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china would like to see the imf take a more prominent role yet the idea is likely to be floated anyway at an upcoming group of 20 summit planned for london in april .
the meeting of industrialized countries will bring together top leaders in hopes of finding a common approach to the global financial crisis .
people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said he would support moving away from the dollar to an imf currency basket that would include a mixture of dollars , euros , sterling and yen .
the imf already created an international reserve asset in 1969 , but the special drawing rights , as it is called , is currently used only by governments and international institutions .
russia has said it will bring up the proposal at the upcoming g20 meeting in london .
russia said its has broad support for its proposal among countries such as brazil , india , china , south korea and south africa .
not likely to happen anytime soon in the near-term , such a radical departure from the way the global financial system works would be near impossible , economists say , although it could be feasible in the long term .
" the arguments for doing such a thing have economic merit , though the actual implementation of such a system would likely take a herculean effort and a great deal of consensus building amongst economic powers , " sacha tihanyi , currency strategist with scotia capital told afp news agency .
" this is an idea , the idea of a global currency , determined by multilateral organizations , which is not new , but it 's a serious proposal , " john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , said at a news conference in response to a question about china 's proposal .
china growing more assertive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the biggest us creditor the recent comments by china 's top banker follows on comments made by china 's premier earlier this month .
they show how concerned the country is about its us assets .
" we have lent huge amounts of money to the united states .
of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets , " chinese premier wen jiabao said two weeks ago .
china holds us treasury bonds worth $ 739.6 billion as of january .
it is also the world 's largest holder of us dollars as a reserve currency , holding more than $ 1 trillion , according to us government figures .
" china appears to be growing more and more assertive over its rights , " currency analyst andrew busch of bmo capital markets told afp news agency .
the dollar , which was installed as the reserve currency after world war ii , has been regarded as a " safe haven " by international investors up to now . th / nda / afp / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .

labour party leader ehud barak got a slim majority of 58 percent of his party to accept the deal , despite concerns in the party basis .
he put into effect what he discussed in a long night of talks with likud leader benjamin netanyahu : the labour party will take part in the coalition and save it from being judged by the world as a " far-right government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the labour party - for decades the party of pioneers , state founders and leaders of the first government , finished only fourth in the most recent election , claiming 13 of the knesset 's 120 seats . it is to be expected that joining netanyahu 's coalition will not slow down labour 's decline , but rather will hasten it .
after all , what party members have perceived is likely to be very clear to the public : barak and the center-left party are more interested in saving themselves and their careers than in morals . barak , of course , is not prepared to make such an admission .
it would mean he would have to contradict himself , since on election day he spoke about joining the opposition .
now he emphasizes that he 's not afraid of netanyahu and that he will serve as a counterbalance to extreme right positions .
as a partner in the coalition he could achieve more than as a 13-member party in the opposition . that may well be , but what can barak achieve in such a government ?
there 's the prime minister who , during campaigning , broke off from restarting the peace process .
the likely foreign minster , avigdor lieberman , has threatened to bomb egypt 's aswan dam ; he sees israeli-arabs as potential enemies in their own country ; and he would prefer attacking iran sooner rather than later .
and there are orthodox coalition partners , primarily concerned with improving the economic and social position of religion in israel . in short , problems and conflicts are preprogrammed both domestically and internationally . the european union has already begun grumbling that it would not be able to work with a far-right government in jerusalem the same way it did with other governments .
washington is alarmed , and the position of hardliners in the arab world who say israel was never interested in peace is being strengthened . in light of this situation , talking about a " counterbalance in the coalition " is a sham .
barak will have to make one compromise after another to make sure other coalition partners do n't leave the government to force early elections .
people now , even in israel , are beginning to ask if barak is n't already camped on the right and wo n't actually have to make any concessions at all .
he will serves as a fig leaf for netanyahu and not as a corrective in the government . his decision is a disservice to his own party , and , more importantly , to hopes for peace . peter philipp is dw 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . author : peter philipp / jen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" at the moment this situation has no effect on the role of the president of the european council , " he said in an eu presidency statement .
topolanek said he would offer his resignation , but that the government could stay in place in a caretaker capacity until the end of the eu presidency , in june .
eu leadership worries the toppling of topolanek 's coalition raised concerns over the czech republic 's ability to carry out the rest of its eu leadership term , at a time when the world 's largest trading bloc is going through its worst economic crisis in decades .
topolanek 's ousting precedes the g20 summit of world leaders in london as well as a special eu summit with us president barack obama in early april .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is more skeptical of the eu europe needs strong leadership in these times of crisis , " joseph daul , head of the center-right european people 's party , the largest parliamentary group in strasbourg , told afp .
" a government which assumes the eu presidency , but in which there is no confidence , can not assume this leadership , " he added .
fate of lisbon treaty even more uncertain the fall of the czech government also calls into question the future of the controversial lisbon treaty , which is meant to streamline the eu bureaucracy but was torpedoed by the irish in a referendum .
even the czechs have cast their doubts about the treaty and although the document has already been approved in the lower house of parliament , the upper senate has yet to ratify it . topolanek had strongly supported the treaty despite opposition from party backbenchers .
he had even once said , " if i lose control of the situation -lrb- in my party -rrb- , then the lisbon treaty will not pass . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech eu presidency ends in june , when sweden takes over on the other hand , czech president vaclav klaus , who has the power to appoint a new prime minister with parliamentary backing , refused to confirm whether he would give his blessing to the treaty . klaus ' hand could be strengthened if topolanek 's government is replaced by one that is more skeptical of eu political integration .
image of eu 's leadership hurt even before the czechs assumed the eu presidency , there had already been concerns in diplomatic circles about the ability of topolanek 's government , as opposed to heavy hitters like france 's nicolas sarkozy , who preceded him , to lead the bloc during a deep economic crisis .
europe 's big three - france , germany and britain - are viewed as the eu 's major powers .
their leadership carries more weight in foreign affairs than that of smaller countries such as the czech republic , which joined the bloc in 2004 .
but european leaders are worried about the eu 's leadership image .
" for the stability and image of europe , it is going to become more difficult , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
in practical terms , even left-leaning czech opposition leader jiri paroubek said in prague after the vote that it was " natural that the government would stay until the end of the eu presidency " on june 30 when sweden takes over the reins in leading the 27 nation bloc . df / jen / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

labour party leader ehud barak got a slim majority of 58 percent of his party to accept the deal , despite concerns in the party basis .
he put into effect what he discussed in a long night of talks with likud leader benjamin netanyahu : the labour party will take part in the coalition and save it from being judged by the world as a " far-right government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the labour party - for decades the party of pioneers , state founders and leaders of the first government , finished only fourth in the most recent election , claiming 13 of the knesset 's 120 seats . it is to be expected that joining netanyahu 's coalition will not slow down labour 's decline , but rather will hasten it .
after all , what party members have perceived is likely to be very clear to the public : barak and the center-left party are more interested in saving themselves and their careers than in morals . barak , of course , is not prepared to make such an admission .
it would mean he would have to contradict himself , since on election day he spoke about joining the opposition .
now he emphasizes that he 's not afraid of netanyahu and that he will serve as a counterbalance to extreme right positions .

mps were outraged that le pen continues to downplay nazi atrocities . the main groups in the eu parliament decided they would change the rules in order to keep le pen from taking on the honorary role of presiding over the european parliament 's opening session this summer .
joseph daul , head of the european people 's party - the biggest grouping in the parliament - said he would " do everything possible " to prevent le pen from taking the chair .

if the proposals are approved by parliament and implemented , anyone trying to access specific web sites will find an empty screen or be redirected to a stop sign .
internet porn the start of a slippery slope , claims minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen warned of the " entry drug " of porn according to the german government 's family minister ursula von der leyen , the ready availability of internet child pornography acts as a form of " entry drug “ for many pedophiles . once established , the addiction can lead to more violent forms of behavior such as abduction , rape and murder .
although the new measures have been welcomed by the federal telecommunications association bitkom , the association 's managing director bernhard rohleder warned against expecting the problems of internet child pornography to be solved once and for all . barring access to certain web sites was a useful measure , he said , as it would reduce the number of chance " hits “ to web sites hosting images of child pornography .
but rohleder added that the proposed new measures would have a limited effect as pedophiles intent on gaining access to child pornography would find ways to feed their habit by taking measures such as concealing the internet address of their home computers . commercial child pornography web sites are also unlikely to be affected by the proposed new law as most of them are accessed through so-called " peer-to-peer " servers , which internet service providers are powerless to control .
eu follows with new protection proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot called for standardized legislation across the eu meanwhile , the european commission today unveiled new proposals to clamp down on child pornography , child sex tourism and human trafficking .
speaking in brussels this morning , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot called for standardizing legislation on sex crimes against children throughout the eu 's 27 member states . " when we speak about child sexual abuse and sexual exploitation , we are speaking about horrendous crimes against children that leave deep scars and suffering for their whole lives , " barrot said .
the eu said it needs to improve cooperation with non-european countries to go after child pornographers and traffickers who operate outside the bloc .
as well as pushing for eu-wide rules on human trafficking , the commission also wants sex tourists to face prosecution when they return to the eu .
the eu also said it plans to work with credit card companies to prevent child pornography from being purchased on the internet . ml / th / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" at the moment this situation has no effect on the role of the president of the european council , " he said in an eu presidency statement .
topolanek said he would offer his resignation , but that the government could stay in place in a caretaker capacity until the end of the eu presidency , in june .
eu leadership worries the toppling of topolanek 's coalition raised concerns over the czech republic 's ability to carry out the rest of its eu leadership term , at a time when the world 's largest trading bloc is going through its worst economic crisis in decades .
topolanek 's ousting precedes the g20 summit of world leaders in london as well as a special eu summit with us president barack obama in early april .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is more skeptical of the eu europe needs strong leadership in these times of crisis , " joseph daul , head of the center-right european people 's party , the largest parliamentary group in strasbourg , told afp .
" a government which assumes the eu presidency , but in which there is no confidence , can not assume this leadership , " he added .
fate of lisbon treaty even more uncertain the fall of the czech government also calls into question the future of the controversial lisbon treaty , which is meant to streamline the eu bureaucracy but was torpedoed by the irish in a referendum .
even the czechs have cast their doubts about the treaty and although the document has already been approved in the lower house of parliament , the upper senate has yet to ratify it . topolanek had strongly supported the treaty despite opposition from party backbenchers .
he had even once said , " if i lose control of the situation -lrb- in my party -rrb- , then the lisbon treaty will not pass . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech eu presidency ends in june , when sweden takes over on the other hand , czech president vaclav klaus , who has the power to appoint a new prime minister with parliamentary backing , refused to confirm whether he would give his blessing to the treaty . klaus ' hand could be strengthened if topolanek 's government is replaced by one that is more skeptical of eu political integration .
image of eu 's leadership hurt even before the czechs assumed the eu presidency , there had already been concerns in diplomatic circles about the ability of topolanek 's government , as opposed to heavy hitters like france 's nicolas sarkozy , who preceded him , to lead the bloc during a deep economic crisis .
europe 's big three - france , germany and britain - are viewed as the eu 's major powers .
their leadership carries more weight in foreign affairs than that of smaller countries such as the czech republic , which joined the bloc in 2004 .
but european leaders are worried about the eu 's leadership image .
" for the stability and image of europe , it is going to become more difficult , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
in practical terms , even left-leaning czech opposition leader jiri paroubek said in prague after the vote that it was " natural that the government would stay until the end of the eu presidency " on june 30 when sweden takes over the reins in leading the 27 nation bloc . df / jen / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" at the moment this situation has no effect on the role of the president of the european council , " he said in an eu presidency statement .
topolanek said he would offer his resignation , but that the government could stay in place in a caretaker capacity until the end of the eu presidency , in june .
eu leadership worries the toppling of topolanek 's coalition raised concerns over the czech republic 's ability to carry out the rest of its eu leadership term , at a time when the world 's largest trading bloc is going through its worst economic crisis in decades .
topolanek 's ousting precedes the g20 summit of world leaders in london as well as a special eu summit with us president barack obama in early april .

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german invasion of russia delayed the first deportations a first wave of deportations of " enemies of the state " took place in 1941 but was interrupted by nazi germany 's invasion of russia , breaking the infamous molotov-ribbentrop pact which had consigned the independent baltic states to the soviet sphere of influence .
with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalniete , a daughter of deportees , wants more coverage latvian member of parliament and former eu commissioner sandra kalniete was born in siberia after her parents were deported from their homeland .
" there is little knowledge about what really happened behind the iron curtain in the baltic states .
it needs to be brought to light and condemned , " she told dpa .
kalniete said she was encouraged by the fact that the events were being marked in european forums .
on march 23 at the opening of the european parliament 's strasbourg plenary session , the parliament 's president hans-gert poettering made a special declaration recalling the deportations .
" this is not a distant and obscure past ; it is still very much a living memory in the minds of many people who are citizens of the european union , " poettering said , describing condemnation of the soviets ' crimes as " our moral obligation and a fundamental duty as europeans . "

if the proposals are approved by parliament and implemented , anyone trying to access specific web sites will find an empty screen or be redirected to a stop sign .
internet porn the start of a slippery slope , claims minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen warned of the " entry drug " of porn according to the german government 's family minister ursula von der leyen , the ready availability of internet child pornography acts as a form of " entry drug “ for many pedophiles . once established , the addiction can lead to more violent forms of behavior such as abduction , rape and murder .
although the new measures have been welcomed by the federal telecommunications association bitkom , the association 's managing director bernhard rohleder warned against expecting the problems of internet child pornography to be solved once and for all . barring access to certain web sites was a useful measure , he said , as it would reduce the number of chance " hits “ to web sites hosting images of child pornography .
but rohleder added that the proposed new measures would have a limited effect as pedophiles intent on gaining access to child pornography would find ways to feed their habit by taking measures such as concealing the internet address of their home computers . commercial child pornography web sites are also unlikely to be affected by the proposed new law as most of them are accessed through so-called " peer-to-peer " servers , which internet service providers are powerless to control .

if the proposals are approved by parliament and implemented , anyone trying to access specific web sites will find an empty screen or be redirected to a stop sign .
internet porn the start of a slippery slope , claims minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen warned of the " entry drug " of porn according to the german government 's family minister ursula von der leyen , the ready availability of internet child pornography acts as a form of " entry drug “ for many pedophiles . once established , the addiction can lead to more violent forms of behavior such as abduction , rape and murder .
although the new measures have been welcomed by the federal telecommunications association bitkom , the association 's managing director bernhard rohleder warned against expecting the problems of internet child pornography to be solved once and for all . barring access to certain web sites was a useful measure , he said , as it would reduce the number of chance " hits “ to web sites hosting images of child pornography .
but rohleder added that the proposed new measures would have a limited effect as pedophiles intent on gaining access to child pornography would find ways to feed their habit by taking measures such as concealing the internet address of their home computers . commercial child pornography web sites are also unlikely to be affected by the proposed new law as most of them are accessed through so-called " peer-to-peer " servers , which internet service providers are powerless to control .
eu follows with new protection proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot called for standardized legislation across the eu meanwhile , the european commission today unveiled new proposals to clamp down on child pornography , child sex tourism and human trafficking .
speaking in brussels this morning , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot called for standardizing legislation on sex crimes against children throughout the eu 's 27 member states . " when we speak about child sexual abuse and sexual exploitation , we are speaking about horrendous crimes against children that leave deep scars and suffering for their whole lives , " barrot said .
the eu said it needs to improve cooperation with non-european countries to go after child pornographers and traffickers who operate outside the bloc .
as well as pushing for eu-wide rules on human trafficking , the commission also wants sex tourists to face prosecution when they return to the eu .
the eu also said it plans to work with credit card companies to prevent child pornography from being purchased on the internet . ml / th / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .

after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german invasion of russia delayed the first deportations a first wave of deportations of " enemies of the state " took place in 1941 but was interrupted by nazi germany 's invasion of russia , breaking the infamous molotov-ribbentrop pact which had consigned the independent baltic states to the soviet sphere of influence .
with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kalniete , a daughter of deportees , wants more coverage latvian member of parliament and former eu commissioner sandra kalniete was born in siberia after her parents were deported from their homeland .
" there is little knowledge about what really happened behind the iron curtain in the baltic states .

in a short period of time , around 100,000 estonians , latvians , lithuanians were sent to siberia in cattle trucks to scratch a living from the permafrost in labor camps .
some died on the way , some died as the years passed - and a few made it home .
among those was juozas , an elderly lithuanian in riga who was urging passers-by to visit a new photography exhibition at the latvian photography museum titled " siberia 1949-1989 " which traces the lives and deaths of deported balts .
" people should come to see what life was like .
it is important that we remember these things so that they do not happen again , " he told the dpa news agency .
having spent nearly 40 years in siberia , he now relishes the freedom that allows him to travel between his adopted home in latvia and his original birthplace in lithuania since both countries became eu members in 2004 .
deportation on the whim of a dictator the " crime " for which most deportees were punished was either nonexistent or a vague suspicion of potential disloyalty to the stalin regime .

with the defeat of nazi germany and the re-occupation of the baltic states by the soviet union , an even more savage round of deportations was launched .
more than two years in the planning , the 1949 operation was carried out on a massive scale .
for example , in estonia around 3 per cent of the entire population was seized in less than a week .
more than three-quarters of estonian deportees were women and children .
some were even deported for a second time after being allowed to return home at the end of the war .
the communist party said the actions were needed in order to " eliminate the kulaks -lrb- wealthy peasants -rrb- as a class . "
sixty years is a long time , but rather than fading from memory , there are signs of renewed interest in the events of 1949 .
revived interest in region 's dark hour in addition to numerous memorial services , a new exhibition about the deportations has just opened at the museum of the occupation of latvia .
the museum also produced a new documentary film on the period .

" we are living through a time of global economic challenges that can not be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation , " obama wrote in an opinion article published in more than two dozen leading global newspapers on tuesday , march 24 .
obama 's media outreach was matched by british prime minister gordon brown , who will host the upcoming g20 meeting .
brown embarked on a world tour to try and drum up international support for economic stimulus measures and reforms .
europe wary on stimulus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has held back on further stimulus measures european governments , particularly france and germany , have been cool to obama 's calls for additional stimulus measures .
at last week 's eu summit in brussels , leaders of the 27-member bloc rejected recent us calls to extend the size of their 400-billion-euro -lrb- $ 544-billion -rrb- stimulus package .
instead , many european leaders want to see tougher regulation of financial institutions .
" -lrb- we need -rrb- coordination at all levels , no loopholes , no black holes , " french economics minister christine lagarde told a financial conference in prague tuesday in a taped video message .
us will outline reform plans this week obama agreed that more regulation is needed .
" if we continue to let financial institutions around the world act recklessly and irresponsibly , we will remain trapped in a cycle of bubble and bust , " obama wrote in his newspaper piece .
us treasury secretary timothy geithner is expected to unveil the government 's plans for regulatory reform on thursday , the white house said .
geithner said he supports far-reaching regulatory reform .
" all institutions and markets that could pose systemic risk will be subject to strong oversight , including appropriate constraints on risk taking , " geithner recently told a congressional committee .
obama 's media outreach came one day after geithner announced a public-private plan that will take over $ 1 trillion in so-called toxic bank assets .
gordon seeks international consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he wants more financial regulations britain 's brown is taking his message that both stimulus and regulatory measures are necessary on a world tour .
brown called for more regulation of the financial markets and more coordinated stimulus of world economies in a speech before the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" regulatory standards should be set across europe and the world , " he said .
" worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to the economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries . "
europe and american need to work more closely , brown added , noting that he spoke with obama about the need for cooperation on monday .
" never in recent years have we had an american leadership so keen on working closely with europe . "
brown will fly to new york for a meeting with un secretary-general ban ki-moon and then to latin america for talks in brazil and chile . th / nda / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expecting thousands of nato protestors german authorities have said they expect about 25,000 demonstrators to show up for the nato summit , which will be held in the towns of baden-baden and kehl in germany and strasbourg in france .

the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "
he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .
" we 're a laughing stock internationally with such ludicrous discussions , " said hans mommsen , 78 , a historian who is one of the moving forces behind the project to reproduce the annotated editions in an interview with dpa news agency .
" and when law enforcement officials are called in and the editor faces federal prosecution , it just reveals germany 's neurosis when it comes to nazism , " he said .
mommsen , who is a professor emeritus from ruhr university and has been a guest professor at american universities such as harvard , princeton and berkeley even argued that hitler 's mein kampf autobiography , which is readily accessible in other countries should also available to the german public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm highly dubious of this project " , said stephan kramer .
" in israel you can buy mein kampf in any book shop , but here it is still banned , " said mommsen .
" that creates a mythic aura for a book which , when read , reveals its banality from a to z. to this very day there is no annotated edition of that book in german , " he said .
german media divided about reprints the nazi newspaper replicas have also divided the german news media .
the national sueddeutsche zeitung said that readers were intelligent enough to see through the propaganda themselves .

since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .

he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .

us and european policymakers are standing behind the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
their comments followed a chinese bid to see the currency replaced by international monetary fund coinage . an upcoming global economic summit could turn into a showdown over the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
china has publicly thrown its support behind other emerging economies such as russia which want to shift the world 's currency away from the dollar to a new currency run by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" the outbreak of the crisis and its spillover to the entire world reflected the inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system , " people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said in a speech posted on the people 's bank of china 's web site .
analysts say zhou 's recent comments are the latest sign of the country 's growing assertiveness on the international stage .
they also show a growing concern china has over the $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.3 trillion euros -rrb- it holds in us treasury bonds and reserve dollars .
us , europe want dollar to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama does n't see the need for a global currency the united states and europe have dismissed the idea of doing away with the dollar as the international reserve currency .
the european union 's top economic official said he thinks the dollar will remain the world 's major reserve currency .
eu commissioner joaquin almunia said he does n't see " major structural changes in the role the dollar plays today as a major reserve currency . "
top us leaders , including president barack obama , said they want the dollar to keep its current status .
" i do n't believe there is a need for a global currency , " us president barack obama said at a press conference on tuesday .
he noted that " the dollar is extraordinarily strong right now , " and although the united states was " going through a rough patch " at present , the dollar enjoyed a " great deal of confidence " from investors .
both us treasury secretary timothy geithner and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said they would not support a plan to strip the dollar of its reserve status .
issue likely to be debated at g20 summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china would like to see the imf take a more prominent role yet the idea is likely to be floated anyway at an upcoming group of 20 summit planned for london in april .
the meeting of industrialized countries will bring together top leaders in hopes of finding a common approach to the global financial crisis .
people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said he would support moving away from the dollar to an imf currency basket that would include a mixture of dollars , euros , sterling and yen .
the imf already created an international reserve asset in 1969 , but the special drawing rights , as it is called , is currently used only by governments and international institutions .
russia has said it will bring up the proposal at the upcoming g20 meeting in london .
russia said its has broad support for its proposal among countries such as brazil , india , china , south korea and south africa .
not likely to happen anytime soon in the near-term , such a radical departure from the way the global financial system works would be near impossible , economists say , although it could be feasible in the long term .
" the arguments for doing such a thing have economic merit , though the actual implementation of such a system would likely take a herculean effort and a great deal of consensus building amongst economic powers , " sacha tihanyi , currency strategist with scotia capital told afp news agency .
" this is an idea , the idea of a global currency , determined by multilateral organizations , which is not new , but it 's a serious proposal , " john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , said at a news conference in response to a question about china 's proposal .
china growing more assertive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the biggest us creditor the recent comments by china 's top banker follows on comments made by china 's premier earlier this month .
they show how concerned the country is about its us assets .
" we have lent huge amounts of money to the united states .
of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets , " chinese premier wen jiabao said two weeks ago .
china holds us treasury bonds worth $ 739.6 billion as of january .
it is also the world 's largest holder of us dollars as a reserve currency , holding more than $ 1 trillion , according to us government figures .
" china appears to be growing more and more assertive over its rights , " currency analyst andrew busch of bmo capital markets told afp news agency .
the dollar , which was installed as the reserve currency after world war ii , has been regarded as a " safe haven " by international investors up to now . th / nda / afp / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us and european policymakers are standing behind the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
their comments followed a chinese bid to see the currency replaced by international monetary fund coinage . an upcoming global economic summit could turn into a showdown over the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
china has publicly thrown its support behind other emerging economies such as russia which want to shift the world 's currency away from the dollar to a new currency run by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" the outbreak of the crisis and its spillover to the entire world reflected the inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system , " people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said in a speech posted on the people 's bank of china 's web site .
analysts say zhou 's recent comments are the latest sign of the country 's growing assertiveness on the international stage .
they also show a growing concern china has over the $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.3 trillion euros -rrb- it holds in us treasury bonds and reserve dollars .
us , europe want dollar to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama does n't see the need for a global currency the united states and europe have dismissed the idea of doing away with the dollar as the international reserve currency .
the european union 's top economic official said he thinks the dollar will remain the world 's major reserve currency .
eu commissioner joaquin almunia said he does n't see " major structural changes in the role the dollar plays today as a major reserve currency . "
top us leaders , including president barack obama , said they want the dollar to keep its current status .
" i do n't believe there is a need for a global currency , " us president barack obama said at a press conference on tuesday .
he noted that " the dollar is extraordinarily strong right now , " and although the united states was " going through a rough patch " at present , the dollar enjoyed a " great deal of confidence " from investors .
both us treasury secretary timothy geithner and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said they would not support a plan to strip the dollar of its reserve status .
issue likely to be debated at g20 summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china would like to see the imf take a more prominent role yet the idea is likely to be floated anyway at an upcoming group of 20 summit planned for london in april .
the meeting of industrialized countries will bring together top leaders in hopes of finding a common approach to the global financial crisis .
people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said he would support moving away from the dollar to an imf currency basket that would include a mixture of dollars , euros , sterling and yen .
the imf already created an international reserve asset in 1969 , but the special drawing rights , as it is called , is currently used only by governments and international institutions .
russia has said it will bring up the proposal at the upcoming g20 meeting in london .
russia said its has broad support for its proposal among countries such as brazil , india , china , south korea and south africa .
not likely to happen anytime soon in the near-term , such a radical departure from the way the global financial system works would be near impossible , economists say , although it could be feasible in the long term .
" the arguments for doing such a thing have economic merit , though the actual implementation of such a system would likely take a herculean effort and a great deal of consensus building amongst economic powers , " sacha tihanyi , currency strategist with scotia capital told afp news agency .
" this is an idea , the idea of a global currency , determined by multilateral organizations , which is not new , but it 's a serious proposal , " john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , said at a news conference in response to a question about china 's proposal .
china growing more assertive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the biggest us creditor the recent comments by china 's top banker follows on comments made by china 's premier earlier this month .
they show how concerned the country is about its us assets .
" we have lent huge amounts of money to the united states .
of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets , " chinese premier wen jiabao said two weeks ago .
china holds us treasury bonds worth $ 739.6 billion as of january .
it is also the world 's largest holder of us dollars as a reserve currency , holding more than $ 1 trillion , according to us government figures .
" china appears to be growing more and more assertive over its rights , " currency analyst andrew busch of bmo capital markets told afp news agency .
the dollar , which was installed as the reserve currency after world war ii , has been regarded as a " safe haven " by international investors up to now . th / nda / afp / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

labour party leader ehud barak got a slim majority of 58 percent of his party to accept the deal , despite concerns in the party basis .
he put into effect what he discussed in a long night of talks with likud leader benjamin netanyahu : the labour party will take part in the coalition and save it from being judged by the world as a " far-right government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the labour party - for decades the party of pioneers , state founders and leaders of the first government , finished only fourth in the most recent election , claiming 13 of the knesset 's 120 seats . it is to be expected that joining netanyahu 's coalition will not slow down labour 's decline , but rather will hasten it .
after all , what party members have perceived is likely to be very clear to the public : barak and the center-left party are more interested in saving themselves and their careers than in morals . barak , of course , is not prepared to make such an admission .
it would mean he would have to contradict himself , since on election day he spoke about joining the opposition .
now he emphasizes that he 's not afraid of netanyahu and that he will serve as a counterbalance to extreme right positions .
as a partner in the coalition he could achieve more than as a 13-member party in the opposition . that may well be , but what can barak achieve in such a government ?
there 's the prime minister who , during campaigning , broke off from restarting the peace process .
the likely foreign minster , avigdor lieberman , has threatened to bomb egypt 's aswan dam ; he sees israeli-arabs as potential enemies in their own country ; and he would prefer attacking iran sooner rather than later .
and there are orthodox coalition partners , primarily concerned with improving the economic and social position of religion in israel . in short , problems and conflicts are preprogrammed both domestically and internationally . the european union has already begun grumbling that it would not be able to work with a far-right government in jerusalem the same way it did with other governments .
washington is alarmed , and the position of hardliners in the arab world who say israel was never interested in peace is being strengthened . in light of this situation , talking about a " counterbalance in the coalition " is a sham .
barak will have to make one compromise after another to make sure other coalition partners do n't leave the government to force early elections .
people now , even in israel , are beginning to ask if barak is n't already camped on the right and wo n't actually have to make any concessions at all .
he will serves as a fig leaf for netanyahu and not as a corrective in the government . his decision is a disservice to his own party , and , more importantly , to hopes for peace . peter philipp is dw 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . author : peter philipp / jen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

labour party leader ehud barak got a slim majority of 58 percent of his party to accept the deal , despite concerns in the party basis .
he put into effect what he discussed in a long night of talks with likud leader benjamin netanyahu : the labour party will take part in the coalition and save it from being judged by the world as a " far-right government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the labour party - for decades the party of pioneers , state founders and leaders of the first government , finished only fourth in the most recent election , claiming 13 of the knesset 's 120 seats . it is to be expected that joining netanyahu 's coalition will not slow down labour 's decline , but rather will hasten it .
after all , what party members have perceived is likely to be very clear to the public : barak and the center-left party are more interested in saving themselves and their careers than in morals . barak , of course , is not prepared to make such an admission .
it would mean he would have to contradict himself , since on election day he spoke about joining the opposition .
now he emphasizes that he 's not afraid of netanyahu and that he will serve as a counterbalance to extreme right positions .
as a partner in the coalition he could achieve more than as a 13-member party in the opposition . that may well be , but what can barak achieve in such a government ?
there 's the prime minister who , during campaigning , broke off from restarting the peace process .
the likely foreign minster , avigdor lieberman , has threatened to bomb egypt 's aswan dam ; he sees israeli-arabs as potential enemies in their own country ; and he would prefer attacking iran sooner rather than later .
and there are orthodox coalition partners , primarily concerned with improving the economic and social position of religion in israel . in short , problems and conflicts are preprogrammed both domestically and internationally . the european union has already begun grumbling that it would not be able to work with a far-right government in jerusalem the same way it did with other governments .
washington is alarmed , and the position of hardliners in the arab world who say israel was never interested in peace is being strengthened . in light of this situation , talking about a " counterbalance in the coalition " is a sham .
barak will have to make one compromise after another to make sure other coalition partners do n't leave the government to force early elections .
people now , even in israel , are beginning to ask if barak is n't already camped on the right and wo n't actually have to make any concessions at all .
he will serves as a fig leaf for netanyahu and not as a corrective in the government . his decision is a disservice to his own party , and , more importantly , to hopes for peace . peter philipp is dw 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east . author : peter philipp / jen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even though anheuser-busch lost its trademark battle with the eu against a czech rival on wednesday , it still retains the right to market the suds under the " budweiser " name in individual european nations . us brewer anheuser-busch lost another battle in its long-running fight over rights to its " budweiser " name . on wednesday , an eu court rejected the company 's claim to register the flagship brand as a european-wide trademark .
anheuser-busch and a smaller czech brewing company , which markets beer as " budweiser budvar " in europe , have fought for nearly a century over the use of the name , but the legal battle began 13 years ago .
st. louis-based anheuser-busch , which was founded by a german immigrant , has used the trademark since 1876 .
it had applied for an eu license to market the beer in europe under the budweiser trademark in 1996 , but was blocked by the czech republic 's budejovicky budvar , which had exclusive rights to sell beer under the brand name in germany and austria .
budvar claims it owns the rights because its beer comes from the czech region of ceske budejovice , which is called budweis in german .
anheuser-busch 's eu appeals rejected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budvar says its beer comes from a place called budweis .
the eu 's trademark office -lrb- ohim -rrb- had rejected anheuser-busch 's application to use the trademark throughout the 27 nation bloc .
anheuser-busch then appealed in court but lost .
its claim was again dismissed when the eu 's court of first instance upheld ohim 's decision .
the upside for the american company - now known as anheuser-busch inbev nv , after a belgian brewer bought it for $ 52 billion -lrb- 39 billion euros -rrb- last year - is that it can still maintain the trademark in individual eu markets .
even though the giant brewer , which is the world 's largest , wo n't have blanket approval for using the budweiser name in the 27 nation bloc as a whole , the belgian company plans to transform the brand , which is a household name for millions of americans , into its flagship product worldwide . rights to " budweiser " name exist in individual eu nations none of budweiser 's existing trademark rights in europe will be cancelled by the ruling , company spokeswoman marianne amssoms told bloomberg news .
anheuser busch inbev already owned the rights to budweiser or bud trademarks in 23 of the 27 eu member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bud " was approved by eu for merchandise , not beer . “ this was merely an effort to further extend our budweiser rights and gain additional protections , ” she said .
the judgment “ does not impact our plans for development of budweiser as a global brand , ” anssoms added .
" budweiser " beverages , which include beer , ale , porter , malted alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks , are sold in germany under the name anheuser-busch bud .
eu also throws " bud " case out of court in a separate case recently , anheuser-busch-inbev also lost a bid in december when the eu court threw out the trademark " bud " for use the entire bloc , but only for the beer .
" bud " , a shortened version of " budweiser " brand name , was approved for use on merchandise such as coasters , t-shirts and other paraphernalia in 2007 .
the company has not ruled out an appeal on the full " budweiser " name before the european court of justice , the eu 's highest court , which would have to be filed within the next two months .
if anheuser-busch-inbev manages to reverse the ruling in the eu 's top court , it would have the right to block budvar from using the budweiser name for its beers . df / nda / afp / ap / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mps were outraged that le pen continues to downplay nazi atrocities . the main groups in the eu parliament decided they would change the rules in order to keep le pen from taking on the honorary role of presiding over the european parliament 's opening session this summer .
joseph daul , head of the european people 's party - the biggest grouping in the parliament - said he would " do everything possible " to prevent le pen from taking the chair .
daul is backed by socialists and the greens in parliament .
le pen insists he 's the victim of " inflammatory accusations " by the parliamentary socialist group head , german european mp martin schulz , who had branded him a holocaust denier .
" i just said that the gas chambers were a detail of second world war history , which is clear , " he told a sitting of the european parliament in strasbourg , france on wednesday , march 25 .
some six million jews were killed during the holocaust .
past convictions for racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen was supposed to preside over the eu parliament le pen , 80 , has several past convictions for racism and anti-semitism .
he shocked europe in 2002 when he placed second in the french presidential elections .
he won 10 percent of votes in the 2007 presidential race .
back in 1987 , le pen was fined 1.2 million francs -lrb- 185,000 euros , $ 290,000 -rrb- for making remarks downplaying the holocaust in a radio interview .
" that proved the state we find the freedom of speech in europe and france , " he said , recalling the case .
parliament 's most senior member le pen was first elected to the european parliament in 1984 .
if he is elected at the top of the national front ticket , he would be granted the honor of presiding over the opening session of parliament due to his seniority and age .
" i am concerned by the fact that a holocaust denier could preside over the opening session of the european parliament , " schulz had said previously .

mps were outraged that le pen continues to downplay nazi atrocities . the main groups in the eu parliament decided they would change the rules in order to keep le pen from taking on the honorary role of presiding over the european parliament 's opening session this summer .
joseph daul , head of the european people 's party - the biggest grouping in the parliament - said he would " do everything possible " to prevent le pen from taking the chair .
daul is backed by socialists and the greens in parliament .
le pen insists he 's the victim of " inflammatory accusations " by the parliamentary socialist group head , german european mp martin schulz , who had branded him a holocaust denier .

back in 1987 , le pen was fined 1.2 million francs -lrb- 185,000 euros , $ 290,000 -rrb- for making remarks downplaying the holocaust in a radio interview .
" that proved the state we find the freedom of speech in europe and france , " he said , recalling the case .
parliament 's most senior member le pen was first elected to the european parliament in 1984 .
if he is elected at the top of the national front ticket , he would be granted the honor of presiding over the opening session of parliament due to his seniority and age .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 25.03.2009 munich court lifts ban on reprints of nazi-era newspapers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi newspaper replica contains historians ' annotations .
a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "
he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .
" we 're a laughing stock internationally with such ludicrous discussions , " said hans mommsen , 78 , a historian who is one of the moving forces behind the project to reproduce the annotated editions in an interview with dpa news agency .
" and when law enforcement officials are called in and the editor faces federal prosecution , it just reveals germany 's neurosis when it comes to nazism , " he said .
mommsen , who is a professor emeritus from ruhr university and has been a guest professor at american universities such as harvard , princeton and berkeley even argued that hitler 's mein kampf autobiography , which is readily accessible in other countries should also available to the german public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm highly dubious of this project " , said stephan kramer .
" in israel you can buy mein kampf in any book shop , but here it is still banned , " said mommsen .
" that creates a mythic aura for a book which , when read , reveals its banality from a to z. to this very day there is no annotated edition of that book in german , " he said .
german media divided about reprints the nazi newspaper replicas have also divided the german news media .
the national sueddeutsche zeitung said that readers were intelligent enough to see through the propaganda themselves .
" you flick through these old newspapers as anyone born long after the war might : in shock and amazement .
the evil -lrb- is right there -rrb- on paper , " the national daily wrote .
a local paper in lower saxony , the peiner allgemeine zeitung suggested that the publishers could be motivated by commercial interests .
" hitler sells better than sex , " the paper said . df / nda / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a publisher 's replicas of nazi era newspapers that hit newsstands in january has sparked a national debate on press censorship .
the court ruling on wednesday lifted the ban since the 70 year old copyrights had expired . a munich court ruled on wednesday that a british publisher 's popular history series called zeitungszeugen , or witness reports would be allowed to reprint old nazi newspapers printed before 1939 .
the court based its decision on a copyright law , which says that reproduction rights can be exercised after a seventy year period .
germany 's state of bavaria controls the copyright to most nazi era newspapers as well as adolf hitler 's autobiography mein kampf and forbids their reproduction .
since hitler died without leaving any heirs , bavaria holds the rights to his estate , which includes nazi newspapers " owned by " the dictator .
the newspaper reprints with articles on hitler being sworn in as chancellor on january 30 , 1933 , have been available on german newsstands since january this year .
police raids munich prosecutors issued orders for police to confiscate newsstand copies of zeitungszeugen , which reprinted nazi dailies such as der angriff , -lrb- the attack -rrb- on grounds that right-wing radicals would use the reprints to for propaganda purposes . germany 's jewish leaders had also warned that re-publishing the nazi-controlled newspapers , which the publisher peter mcgee says is part of a campaign to raise historical awareness , could set a dangerous precedent .
" i 'm highly dubious about this project , " stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told reuters after the first run of 250,000 copies was circulated all across germany .
the initial press run had sold out so fast that another 50,000 copies were printed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british publisher can now reprint nazi era papers before 1939 .
fear of nazi reprints being used as propaganda kramer said he feared that the neo-nazi movement could misuse the collection of newspapers as a rallying point and that even ordinary germans would take the nazi claims at face value .
on page one of der angriff for example , hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , attacked the " jewish press " in a column under the headline : " make a clean sweep ! "
he wrote : " it 's time to cure the ill german body and bring it back to life again " .
the british publishers accused the bavarian authorities of censorship and argue that it is high time for young germans to be able to see the headlines that their great grandparents saw , especially since the reprinted articles are often accompanied by detailed annotations written by historians .
they also pointed out that each weekly issue contains reprints of not just the nazi press , but also papers of other political persuasions , such those with communist and moderate views .
bavarian authorities argue that the replica newspapers can be cut , pasted and re-printed for separate use without the historical annotations , thereby violating the letter of a german law that generally bans publication of nazi propaganda and symbols such as the swastika with few exceptions .
national debate on coming to terms with nazi past police raids and official efforts to ban the reprints of nazi-era newspapers have sparked a national debate about whether germans are ready to cope with their historical demons .
" we 're a laughing stock internationally with such ludicrous discussions , " said hans mommsen , 78 , a historian who is one of the moving forces behind the project to reproduce the annotated editions in an interview with dpa news agency .
" and when law enforcement officials are called in and the editor faces federal prosecution , it just reveals germany 's neurosis when it comes to nazism , " he said .
mommsen , who is a professor emeritus from ruhr university and has been a guest professor at american universities such as harvard , princeton and berkeley even argued that hitler 's mein kampf autobiography , which is readily accessible in other countries should also available to the german public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm highly dubious of this project " , said stephan kramer .
" in israel you can buy mein kampf in any book shop , but here it is still banned , " said mommsen .
" that creates a mythic aura for a book which , when read , reveals its banality from a to z. to this very day there is no annotated edition of that book in german , " he said .
german media divided about reprints the nazi newspaper replicas have also divided the german news media .

if the proposals are approved by parliament and implemented , anyone trying to access specific web sites will find an empty screen or be redirected to a stop sign .
internet porn the start of a slippery slope , claims minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen warned of the " entry drug " of porn according to the german government 's family minister ursula von der leyen , the ready availability of internet child pornography acts as a form of " entry drug “ for many pedophiles . once established , the addiction can lead to more violent forms of behavior such as abduction , rape and murder .
although the new measures have been welcomed by the federal telecommunications association bitkom , the association 's managing director bernhard rohleder warned against expecting the problems of internet child pornography to be solved once and for all . barring access to certain web sites was a useful measure , he said , as it would reduce the number of chance " hits “ to web sites hosting images of child pornography .
but rohleder added that the proposed new measures would have a limited effect as pedophiles intent on gaining access to child pornography would find ways to feed their habit by taking measures such as concealing the internet address of their home computers . commercial child pornography web sites are also unlikely to be affected by the proposed new law as most of them are accessed through so-called " peer-to-peer " servers , which internet service providers are powerless to control .
eu follows with new protection proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot called for standardized legislation across the eu meanwhile , the european commission today unveiled new proposals to clamp down on child pornography , child sex tourism and human trafficking .
speaking in brussels this morning , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot called for standardizing legislation on sex crimes against children throughout the eu 's 27 member states . " when we speak about child sexual abuse and sexual exploitation , we are speaking about horrendous crimes against children that leave deep scars and suffering for their whole lives , " barrot said .
the eu said it needs to improve cooperation with non-european countries to go after child pornographers and traffickers who operate outside the bloc .
as well as pushing for eu-wide rules on human trafficking , the commission also wants sex tourists to face prosecution when they return to the eu .
the eu also said it plans to work with credit card companies to prevent child pornography from being purchased on the internet . ml / th / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .

after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expecting thousands of nato protestors german authorities have said they expect about 25,000 demonstrators to show up for the nato summit , which will be held in the towns of baden-baden and kehl in germany and strasbourg in france .

if the proposals are approved by parliament and implemented , anyone trying to access specific web sites will find an empty screen or be redirected to a stop sign .
internet porn the start of a slippery slope , claims minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen warned of the " entry drug " of porn according to the german government 's family minister ursula von der leyen , the ready availability of internet child pornography acts as a form of " entry drug “ for many pedophiles . once established , the addiction can lead to more violent forms of behavior such as abduction , rape and murder .
although the new measures have been welcomed by the federal telecommunications association bitkom , the association 's managing director bernhard rohleder warned against expecting the problems of internet child pornography to be solved once and for all . barring access to certain web sites was a useful measure , he said , as it would reduce the number of chance " hits “ to web sites hosting images of child pornography .
but rohleder added that the proposed new measures would have a limited effect as pedophiles intent on gaining access to child pornography would find ways to feed their habit by taking measures such as concealing the internet address of their home computers . commercial child pornography web sites are also unlikely to be affected by the proposed new law as most of them are accessed through so-called " peer-to-peer " servers , which internet service providers are powerless to control .
eu follows with new protection proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot called for standardized legislation across the eu meanwhile , the european commission today unveiled new proposals to clamp down on child pornography , child sex tourism and human trafficking .
speaking in brussels this morning , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot called for standardizing legislation on sex crimes against children throughout the eu 's 27 member states . " when we speak about child sexual abuse and sexual exploitation , we are speaking about horrendous crimes against children that leave deep scars and suffering for their whole lives , " barrot said .
the eu said it needs to improve cooperation with non-european countries to go after child pornographers and traffickers who operate outside the bloc .
as well as pushing for eu-wide rules on human trafficking , the commission also wants sex tourists to face prosecution when they return to the eu .
the eu also said it plans to work with credit card companies to prevent child pornography from being purchased on the internet . ml / th / nda / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mps were outraged that le pen continues to downplay nazi atrocities . the main groups in the eu parliament decided they would change the rules in order to keep le pen from taking on the honorary role of presiding over the european parliament 's opening session this summer .
joseph daul , head of the european people 's party - the biggest grouping in the parliament - said he would " do everything possible " to prevent le pen from taking the chair .
daul is backed by socialists and the greens in parliament .
le pen insists he 's the victim of " inflammatory accusations " by the parliamentary socialist group head , german european mp martin schulz , who had branded him a holocaust denier .
" i just said that the gas chambers were a detail of second world war history , which is clear , " he told a sitting of the european parliament in strasbourg , france on wednesday , march 25 .
some six million jews were killed during the holocaust .
past convictions for racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen was supposed to preside over the eu parliament le pen , 80 , has several past convictions for racism and anti-semitism .
he shocked europe in 2002 when he placed second in the french presidential elections .
he won 10 percent of votes in the 2007 presidential race .
back in 1987 , le pen was fined 1.2 million francs -lrb- 185,000 euros , $ 290,000 -rrb- for making remarks downplaying the holocaust in a radio interview .
" that proved the state we find the freedom of speech in europe and france , " he said , recalling the case .
parliament 's most senior member le pen was first elected to the european parliament in 1984 .
if he is elected at the top of the national front ticket , he would be granted the honor of presiding over the opening session of parliament due to his seniority and age .
" i am concerned by the fact that a holocaust denier could preside over the opening session of the european parliament , " schulz had said previously .

yet obama said he also feels the alliance should not be afraid of expanding its borders . the future of the north atlantic treaty organization 's relationship with russia was a big topic as obama met with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer on wednesday , march 25 .
obama said he wants to " reset " us-russian relations , which have become increasingly strained .
but obama said that good relations with moscow would not come at the expense of nato expansion , something which russia vehemently opposes .
the united states has supported bringing countries such as georgia and ukraine into nato , although obama did not mention the countries by name .
obama said it was important to " send a clear signal throughout europe that we are going to continue to abide by the central belief ... that countries who seek and aspire to join nato are able to join nato . "
scheffer played down the alliance 's disagreements with russia after wednesday 's meeting .
" we have many things on which we disagree , but nato needs russia and russia needs nato , so that 's one of the things we agree on , " he said after the meeting .
a difficult relationship but the alliance 's top commander says nato 's relationship with russia is more difficult than at any time since the end of the cold war .
general john craddock pointed to russia 's war with georgia in august of 2008 as well as disputes with ukraine over gas supplies this year as contentious issues .
he made the comments as part of written testimony before the us senate armed services committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer : " nato needs russia and russia needs nato " russia is also unhappy with us plans to set up a missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
" we are in a time of uncertainty in the us-russian relationship brought about by disagreements over european security , russia 's role in what it regards as its neighborhood , and russia 's decision to send forces into georgia and to recognize the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , " craddock wrote .
after the cold war ended , many believed that europe and eurasia were no longer at threat of being invaded , an assumption which " has been now proven false , " craddock said , pointing to russia 's incursion into georgia .
craddock also said he 's like the united states to maintain the size of its military presence in europe , despite plans to reduce the number of us soldiers stationed in countries such as germany .
nato turning 60 while russia was a main topic of discussion , obama and scheffer also discussed the alliance 's stragegy in fighting militants in afghanistan and plans for nato 's 60th anniversary summit .
the meeting will be held in germany and france on april 3-4 .
obama said the 60th anniversary of the military alliance was " testimony to the effectiveness of nato in creating stability and peace and prosperity , laying the groundwork for so much that has taken place over the last several years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is expecting thousands of nato protestors german authorities have said they expect about 25,000 demonstrators to show up for the nato summit , which will be held in the towns of baden-baden and kehl in germany and strasbourg in france .
germany will provide 600 soldiers and 15,000 police to guard the 3,500 delegates from attacks , germany has said .
germany and nato will also deploy warplanes and surveillance aircraft to patrol the airspace .

mps were outraged that le pen continues to downplay nazi atrocities . the main groups in the eu parliament decided they would change the rules in order to keep le pen from taking on the honorary role of presiding over the european parliament 's opening session this summer .
joseph daul , head of the european people 's party - the biggest grouping in the parliament - said he would " do everything possible " to prevent le pen from taking the chair .
daul is backed by socialists and the greens in parliament .
le pen insists he 's the victim of " inflammatory accusations " by the parliamentary socialist group head , german european mp martin schulz , who had branded him a holocaust denier .
" i just said that the gas chambers were a detail of second world war history , which is clear , " he told a sitting of the european parliament in strasbourg , france on wednesday , march 25 .
some six million jews were killed during the holocaust .
past convictions for racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen was supposed to preside over the eu parliament le pen , 80 , has several past convictions for racism and anti-semitism .
he shocked europe in 2002 when he placed second in the french presidential elections .
he won 10 percent of votes in the 2007 presidential race .
back in 1987 , le pen was fined 1.2 million francs -lrb- 185,000 euros , $ 290,000 -rrb- for making remarks downplaying the holocaust in a radio interview .
" that proved the state we find the freedom of speech in europe and france , " he said , recalling the case .
parliament 's most senior member le pen was first elected to the european parliament in 1984 .
if he is elected at the top of the national front ticket , he would be granted the honor of presiding over the opening session of parliament due to his seniority and age .
" i am concerned by the fact that a holocaust denier could preside over the opening session of the european parliament , " schulz had said previously .

mps were outraged that le pen continues to downplay nazi atrocities . the main groups in the eu parliament decided they would change the rules in order to keep le pen from taking on the honorary role of presiding over the european parliament 's opening session this summer .
joseph daul , head of the european people 's party - the biggest grouping in the parliament - said he would " do everything possible " to prevent le pen from taking the chair .
daul is backed by socialists and the greens in parliament .
le pen insists he 's the victim of " inflammatory accusations " by the parliamentary socialist group head , german european mp martin schulz , who had branded him a holocaust denier .

" that proved the state we find the freedom of speech in europe and france , " he said , recalling the case .
parliament 's most senior member le pen was first elected to the european parliament in 1984 .
if he is elected at the top of the national front ticket , he would be granted the honor of presiding over the opening session of parliament due to his seniority and age .
" i am concerned by the fact that a holocaust denier could preside over the opening session of the european parliament , " schulz had said previously .

inmates there live and work in conditions that authorities hope will prepare them for a normal life after they get out . the only way to get to bastoy prison is to take the small prison ferry boat from the port of horten , about two hours south of oslo .
what was once a state institution for delinquent youths has now become the final stop for male inmates nearing the end of their sentences . but any similarities to rikers island in new york or the now defunct alcatraz in san francisco ends upon arrival .
bastoy looks like anything but a prison .
there are no high razor-wire fences , no concrete cell blocks and no watch towers .
instead , the small island looks more like a tranquil scandinavian health resort .
prisoners live in quaint wooden cottages overlooking pine forests , fields of wheat and inviting beaches . oyvind alnaes , the governor of bastoy , says that the prison is managed on ecological and humanist values . " we think that we have to treat the inmates in a proper way because they will open their ears and eyes and maybe are willing to learn something , " alnaes says .
" we use the ecological way of running this prison as a tool to learn responsibility and have concerns about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prisoner 's cottages must be maintained by the inmates themselves for the some 110 male inmates that begins on day one .
all new arrivals are trained how to cook , clean and look after themselves .
each inmate has his own space in the typical four-bedroom cottages . " but there are still inspections to come and see that you clean your room and make your bed , " inmate haarvald says .
" it should look like a normal room that you have at home in a normal life and the best thing is that they are all in a social environment . "
he says it gives the inmates the feeling that " they belong to society . " responsibility and leisure during the day , most inmates are employed in some form of livestock , farming or maintenance work .
haarvald works with the island 's six horses that are used for plowing and for transporting supplies .
twice a day , he has to go to the ferry and pick up goods .
some days , there is nothing to pick up and many other prisoners question why they even have to go . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking care of horses teach prisoners responsibility " as soon as you take the reins of the horse , you are training him and this is part of their responsibilities , " haarvald says .
" and here we 're talking about tough criminals - they get a responsibility and they can take it with them outside as a free man . " responsibilities at work also provide opportunities for leisure on the island .
for haarvald , that means he can ride horses in his free time . " on a sunday morning , i get up on a horse and go down by the beach - the sun has just come up , birds are flying , a seal is lying on the rock outside , " he says .
" you have to pinch your arm to remember where you are . " building trust for the 30 prison officers at bastoy , dialogue and trust with inmates is important .
officers and inmates call each other by their first names .
principal officer mia eklassens says bastoy makes a good place for inmates to end their sentences . " here we are trying to give you a great deal of trust and trying to work with you so that you are not going to prison again , " eklassens says .
" we 're trying to give the prisoners some sense of pride in what he has accomplished while he is here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some prisoners are in charge of livestock in addition , the prison tries to help inmates deal with problems like drugs , violence and reconnecting with their families . " that 's why i think it 's a good place to serve your sentence , " eklassens says . special freedoms bastoy prison might function well as a liberal institution .
but norway also has the full spectrum of jails , including maximum security facilities .
for george , one of the few foreign inmates on bastoy , serving out his sentence on the island is like leading a normal life compared to conditions he experienced in ringerike , norway 's maximum security prison . " that one was perhaps the toughest prison in the whole of norway because the way you are treated there in a way brings you down , " george says .
" i would have been a very bitter man when i would have come out of ringerike . " the prisoners of bastoy are fortunate to live in surroundings that many of norway 's prisoners would wish to appreciate during their sentences .
while prison staff believe they work in the best prison in the world , the jury is still out on whether time at bastoy is the catalyst for inmates putting a life of crime behind them for good . what is certain , though , is that the inmate islanders live in a unique prison .
life is not a beach at bastoy but there is a chance for prisoners to enjoy a special kind of freedom and to regain responsibility over the lives . guy degen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" at the moment this situation has no effect on the role of the president of the european council , " he said in an eu presidency statement .
topolanek said he would offer his resignation , but that the government could stay in place in a caretaker capacity until the end of the eu presidency , in june .
eu leadership worries the toppling of topolanek 's coalition raised concerns over the czech republic 's ability to carry out the rest of its eu leadership term , at a time when the world 's largest trading bloc is going through its worst economic crisis in decades .
topolanek 's ousting precedes the g20 summit of world leaders in london as well as a special eu summit with us president barack obama in early april .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is more skeptical of the eu europe needs strong leadership in these times of crisis , " joseph daul , head of the center-right european people 's party , the largest parliamentary group in strasbourg , told afp .
" a government which assumes the eu presidency , but in which there is no confidence , can not assume this leadership , " he added .
fate of lisbon treaty even more uncertain the fall of the czech government also calls into question the future of the controversial lisbon treaty , which is meant to streamline the eu bureaucracy but was torpedoed by the irish in a referendum .
even the czechs have cast their doubts about the treaty and although the document has already been approved in the lower house of parliament , the upper senate has yet to ratify it . topolanek had strongly supported the treaty despite opposition from party backbenchers .
he had even once said , " if i lose control of the situation -lrb- in my party -rrb- , then the lisbon treaty will not pass . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech eu presidency ends in june , when sweden takes over on the other hand , czech president vaclav klaus , who has the power to appoint a new prime minister with parliamentary backing , refused to confirm whether he would give his blessing to the treaty . klaus ' hand could be strengthened if topolanek 's government is replaced by one that is more skeptical of eu political integration .
image of eu 's leadership hurt even before the czechs assumed the eu presidency , there had already been concerns in diplomatic circles about the ability of topolanek 's government , as opposed to heavy hitters like france 's nicolas sarkozy , who preceded him , to lead the bloc during a deep economic crisis .
europe 's big three - france , germany and britain - are viewed as the eu 's major powers .
their leadership carries more weight in foreign affairs than that of smaller countries such as the czech republic , which joined the bloc in 2004 .
but european leaders are worried about the eu 's leadership image .
" for the stability and image of europe , it is going to become more difficult , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
in practical terms , even left-leaning czech opposition leader jiri paroubek said in prague after the vote that it was " natural that the government would stay until the end of the eu presidency " on june 30 when sweden takes over the reins in leading the 27 nation bloc . df / jen / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there 's no cause at the moment to think about any other solutions , " zwanziger told german press agency dpa on wednesday , march 25 , when asked about possible replacements for the men 's team coach . loew has said he wants to wait until germany has qualified for south africa before considering extending his contract beyond 2010 .

us and european policymakers are standing behind the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
their comments followed a chinese bid to see the currency replaced by international monetary fund coinage . an upcoming global economic summit could turn into a showdown over the dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
china has publicly thrown its support behind other emerging economies such as russia which want to shift the world 's currency away from the dollar to a new currency run by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
" the outbreak of the crisis and its spillover to the entire world reflected the inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system , " people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said in a speech posted on the people 's bank of china 's web site .
analysts say zhou 's recent comments are the latest sign of the country 's growing assertiveness on the international stage .
they also show a growing concern china has over the $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.3 trillion euros -rrb- it holds in us treasury bonds and reserve dollars .
us , europe want dollar to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama does n't see the need for a global currency the united states and europe have dismissed the idea of doing away with the dollar as the international reserve currency .
the european union 's top economic official said he thinks the dollar will remain the world 's major reserve currency .
eu commissioner joaquin almunia said he does n't see " major structural changes in the role the dollar plays today as a major reserve currency . "
top us leaders , including president barack obama , said they want the dollar to keep its current status .
" i do n't believe there is a need for a global currency , " us president barack obama said at a press conference on tuesday .
he noted that " the dollar is extraordinarily strong right now , " and although the united states was " going through a rough patch " at present , the dollar enjoyed a " great deal of confidence " from investors .
both us treasury secretary timothy geithner and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said they would not support a plan to strip the dollar of its reserve status .
issue likely to be debated at g20 summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china would like to see the imf take a more prominent role yet the idea is likely to be floated anyway at an upcoming group of 20 summit planned for london in april .
the meeting of industrialized countries will bring together top leaders in hopes of finding a common approach to the global financial crisis .
people 's bank of china governor zhou xiaochuan said he would support moving away from the dollar to an imf currency basket that would include a mixture of dollars , euros , sterling and yen .
the imf already created an international reserve asset in 1969 , but the special drawing rights , as it is called , is currently used only by governments and international institutions .
russia has said it will bring up the proposal at the upcoming g20 meeting in london .
russia said its has broad support for its proposal among countries such as brazil , india , china , south korea and south africa .
not likely to happen anytime soon in the near-term , such a radical departure from the way the global financial system works would be near impossible , economists say , although it could be feasible in the long term .
" the arguments for doing such a thing have economic merit , though the actual implementation of such a system would likely take a herculean effort and a great deal of consensus building amongst economic powers , " sacha tihanyi , currency strategist with scotia capital told afp news agency .
" this is an idea , the idea of a global currency , determined by multilateral organizations , which is not new , but it 's a serious proposal , " john lipsky , the imf 's first deputy managing director , said at a news conference in response to a question about china 's proposal .
china growing more assertive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the biggest us creditor the recent comments by china 's top banker follows on comments made by china 's premier earlier this month .
they show how concerned the country is about its us assets .
" we have lent huge amounts of money to the united states .
of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets , " chinese premier wen jiabao said two weeks ago .
china holds us treasury bonds worth $ 739.6 billion as of january .
it is also the world 's largest holder of us dollars as a reserve currency , holding more than $ 1 trillion , according to us government figures .
" china appears to be growing more and more assertive over its rights , " currency analyst andrew busch of bmo capital markets told afp news agency .
