program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2009 do german political parties have too much money ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political parties will likely spend over 60 million euros , much of it on advertising with german election campaigns becoming more expensive , political parties have adopted american-style tactics , such as asking for small donations online .
what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2009 taking stock of germany 's ' grand coalition ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merke 's cdu comes out ahead of steinmeier 's spd as the results come in , it looks likely that the christian democrats will form a coalition with the business friendly free democrats and thus mark the end of the grand coalition .
dw looks back at the last four years . if chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- forge a new center-right government with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , it would spell the end of the four-year alliance with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
deutsche welle looks back at the last four years and the record of the grand coalition .
two big parties means little opposition elected in the autumn of 2005 to replace the spd-green coalition of then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , merkel and her deputy , steinmeier , set about turning former political foes into friends and tackling a long list of unfinished business .
at the time , merkel said the new cdu-spd coalition offered " an opportunity to overcome the economic crisis and advance reforms . "
since then , the grand coalition , facing only a small and ideologically divided opposition in parliament , has pushed through a wide range of legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is one of the few things merkel and steinmeier disagree on in the area of finance and economic reform , the grand coalition introduced the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , increasing the sales tax from 16 to 19 percent .
the government raised the pension age to 67 from 65 to offset the costs of an aging population .
it also extended the minimum wage to new sectors of the economy , but did not introduce a blanket minimum for everybody .
rising to the challenges of the economic crisis it successfully reined in budget deficits , only to see the savings evaporate in the face of the global economic crisis and is now sitting atop the biggest deficit germany has ever had .
to combat the economic meltdown the government passed two stimulus packages worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- .
it also set up a mammoth 500-billion-euro bank rescue plan to boost liquidity , and a 100-billion-euro " bad bank " plan to relieve banks of their toxic assets .
it introduced a much-copied " cash-for-clunkers " program to help the auto industry out of a serious sales slump .
the coalition also jumped to the rescue of german carmaker , opel , a subsidiary of us automaker , general motors .
the deal , according to the german weekly magazine , der spiegel , was so important to merkel that she told us president barack obama that it was " a test case for transatlantic relations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel meeting the dalai lama strained relations between berlin and beijing mixed reviews on foreign policy those relations would indeed be tested in the foreign policy sector .
the coalition first mended ties with the united states , which were sorely strained over the iraq war .
merkel then took a critical approach toward russia and china on human rights issues and caused outrage in beijing in 2007 by meeting the dalai lama .
however , the coalition has since been sharply criticized for its all-too chummy relationship with moscow , especially in the energy sector .
these ties prompted finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb to comment that germany has " weakened the unity of the european union . "
merkel and steinmeier have also been taken to task for their contradictory relationship to nato .
on the one hand , germany is participating in naval monitoring missions off the coast of lebanon and the horn of africa , but has been very reticent to get more involved in afghanistan , where it has about 4,200 troops in a mostly non-combat capacity .
coalition pushes climate agenda merkel did , however , earn considerable kudos for her six-month role as head of the eu presidency .
she got eu and g-8 members to tackle climate change and laid the groundwork for the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
back on the home front , the grand coalition introduced steps for germany to cut its co2 emissions by more than a third by 2020 and boosted efforts to promote renewable energy sources .
but , the cdu and spd remain starkly divided over the issue of nuclear energy and whether or not to keep or extend a planned phase-out by 2030. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " if the collapse of the berlin wall marked a watershed in world history , it did all the more so for the countries of central and eastern europe , enabling them to take their rightful place as sovereign actors in the concert of nations , " the pontiff said . the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 . the visit by benedict is a sojourn to the most secular country in europe and comes shortly before the 20th anniversary of the velvet revolution , the peaceful coup which toppled the communist regime of former czechoslovakia . religious beliefs , and especially their display , were banned in communist czechoslovakia , which viewed the church , and religion as a whole , as an enemy of the people .
the regime kept priests under police surveillance and suppressed catholic publications and associations . bildunterschrift : the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 on the sidelines of the papal visit , vatican and czech representatives also discussed the sensitive issue of returning church property confiscated by the communists after world war ii .
a large number of churches , chapels , monasteries , agricultural land and artwork were nationalized by the czech regime at the time . pontiff confronts widely atheist public the pope , however , faces an uphill struggle to bring a religious revival to the country , despite the fall of communism . nearly 60 percent of czechs do not identify with any religion , according to a census taken in 2001 , up from 39 percent a decade earlier , putting the czech republic in stark contrast to neighboring and deeply devout poland .
the percentage of believers , on the other hand , dropped sharply between 1991 and 2001 from almost 44 percent to 32 percent , according to figures from the czech statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few czechs identify with religion but enough came to celebrate mass with the pope that has not deterred the pontiff , however , who said prior to his visit that " after going through the dramas of the past century , -lrb- the czech republic -rrb- needs , like the rest of the continent , to rediscover the reasons for faith and for hope . " church data indicates that there are also more people of faith than the government statistics show , according to jana michalkova , a spokeswoman for the diocese in litomerice , some 80 kilometers north of prague .
but , michalkova admits that half of the churches and chapels in her area were in very poor condition and some sunday masses " served just one or two people . " benedict not visiting former ethnic german region the pope 's agenda in the czech republic includes stopovers in prague , the southeastern city of brno and stara boleslav just outside prague . he will not be visiting the country 's western sudeten region , which was once mostly inhabited by ethnic germans , who were driven from their homes and fled to germany and austria after world war ii . the expulsion of the ethnic german catholics only accelerated the decline of religion in the post-war era and has been a frequent thorn in relations between the czech republic and germany . gb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .

" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "

" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .

the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .
seeking a new alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " angie " is likely to win a second term in office , but she will need a coalition partner this time , merkel is hoping to garner enough votes to form an alliance with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "
a grand-coalition revival ?
the spd candidate frank-walter steinmeier has been gaining ground in the past few days .
and although there is every indication that merkel will win a second term in office , there has been increasing talk of another round of the grand-coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's supporters think that germany would be better off without " angie " in a speech to voters in dresden on saturday , steinmeier warned voters against electing a center-right government .
" those who do n't want this country to be torn apart into winners and losers must go and vote tomorrow , " he said .
" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .
in a letter published in the mass circulation bild am sonntag newspaper on election day , the german president horst koehler has appealed to the electorate not to be apathetic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters can come down as it 's up to the electorate now " non-voters are not represented in parliament , " koehler said .
" if you do n't vote , there is nobody in parliament to put forward your concerns , " he played on the collective conscience of the modern electorate , reminding voters that their right to have their say was not always a given .
" people died in the name of free , secret and equal voting rights , " he said .
" it is our democracy and we should n't weaken it . " tkw / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2009 opinion : new government faces tough task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a new government with the pro-business fdp .
dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

dw looks back at the last four years . if chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- forge a new center-right government with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , it would spell the end of the four-year alliance with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
deutsche welle looks back at the last four years and the record of the grand coalition .
two big parties means little opposition elected in the autumn of 2005 to replace the spd-green coalition of then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , merkel and her deputy , steinmeier , set about turning former political foes into friends and tackling a long list of unfinished business .
at the time , merkel said the new cdu-spd coalition offered " an opportunity to overcome the economic crisis and advance reforms . "
since then , the grand coalition , facing only a small and ideologically divided opposition in parliament , has pushed through a wide range of legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is one of the few things merkel and steinmeier disagree on in the area of finance and economic reform , the grand coalition introduced the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , increasing the sales tax from 16 to 19 percent .
the government raised the pension age to 67 from 65 to offset the costs of an aging population .
it also extended the minimum wage to new sectors of the economy , but did not introduce a blanket minimum for everybody .
rising to the challenges of the economic crisis it successfully reined in budget deficits , only to see the savings evaporate in the face of the global economic crisis and is now sitting atop the biggest deficit germany has ever had .
to combat the economic meltdown the government passed two stimulus packages worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- .
it also set up a mammoth 500-billion-euro bank rescue plan to boost liquidity , and a 100-billion-euro " bad bank " plan to relieve banks of their toxic assets .
it introduced a much-copied " cash-for-clunkers " program to help the auto industry out of a serious sales slump .
the coalition also jumped to the rescue of german carmaker , opel , a subsidiary of us automaker , general motors .
the deal , according to the german weekly magazine , der spiegel , was so important to merkel that she told us president barack obama that it was " a test case for transatlantic relations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel meeting the dalai lama strained relations between berlin and beijing mixed reviews on foreign policy those relations would indeed be tested in the foreign policy sector .
the coalition first mended ties with the united states , which were sorely strained over the iraq war .
merkel then took a critical approach toward russia and china on human rights issues and caused outrage in beijing in 2007 by meeting the dalai lama .
however , the coalition has since been sharply criticized for its all-too chummy relationship with moscow , especially in the energy sector .
these ties prompted finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb to comment that germany has " weakened the unity of the european union . "
merkel and steinmeier have also been taken to task for their contradictory relationship to nato .
on the one hand , germany is participating in naval monitoring missions off the coast of lebanon and the horn of africa , but has been very reticent to get more involved in afghanistan , where it has about 4,200 troops in a mostly non-combat capacity .
coalition pushes climate agenda merkel did , however , earn considerable kudos for her six-month role as head of the eu presidency .
she got eu and g-8 members to tackle climate change and laid the groundwork for the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
back on the home front , the grand coalition introduced steps for germany to cut its co2 emissions by more than a third by 2020 and boosted efforts to promote renewable energy sources .
but , the cdu and spd remain starkly divided over the issue of nuclear energy and whether or not to keep or extend a planned phase-out by 2030. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2009 do german political parties have too much money ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political parties will likely spend over 60 million euros , much of it on advertising with german election campaigns becoming more expensive , political parties have adopted american-style tactics , such as asking for small donations online .
what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

german and chinese organizers have clashed over attendees . " massacre " is the name of the poem written by liao yiwu that sent him to prison for four years .
in it , he condemned the 1989 killings in tiananmen square .
in his book " the corpse walker " - that 's just been published in german - he tells the stories of people from the bottom-rung of chinese society - from a village teacher to a blind street musician - left behind in the country 's economic boom .
the fifty-year-old chinese musician , reporter , and author , was supposed to travel to berlin next month to participate in a panel discussion at the berlin house of world cultures .
but , he says , chinese authorities have banned him from traveling .
" chinese state security officials told me that i will not be allowed to fly to germany , " liao was quoted in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's books are available in germany - not in china " for people in the west , it 's the most normal thing in the world to be able to write freely .
in china , we have to fight for this , " he told deutsche welle .
controversy surrounding frankfurt book fair the event at the berlin house of world cultures is one of several connected with the frankfurt book fair , which takes place from october 14-18 .
china has been invited to be this year 's guest nation , but organizers in germany are finding it difficult to work with a country that limits press freedom .
two weeks ago , two chinese dissident writers had their invitations to the frankfurt book fair revoked by german organizers , after china 's organizing committee complained .
the move angered many in germany who felt china was taking charge of the event .
however , china expert matthias von hein says china does not have as much control as critics think .
" china is in a strange position at this book fair because it has been willing to present itself there , knowing that the frankfurt book fair is an event that can not be totally controlled by the propaganda department , " he said .
he added that there are many chinese writers in attendance at these events who have drawn the ire of chinese officials .
press freedom in the " new " china while china 's economic boom has made it a more formidable presence on the world stage - as was demonstrated by its hosting of the 2008 summer olympic games - it still struggles with what face to put forward - one of a modern , open society or one that resembles more of the " old " china . bildunterschrift : critics accused china of using the olympic games as a pr event while at the same time suppressing criticism and dissent within china liao yiwu 's work is still unavailable in his homeland .
and though he is dismayed by his travel ban , he vows never to stop expressing his views .
" even if the authorities try to censor me , i will continue to work .
at least if people read my book , i 'll have made an impact , " he said .
although there has been much controversy surrounding the choice of china as a guest country for the frankfurt book fair , stemming from the past weeks ' events , matthias von hein believes this is a good step for both germany and china .
" i believe it is always good to challenge chinese partners with different concepts of press freedom , human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
and the more opportunities there are , the better it is . " vj / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move angered many in germany who felt china was taking charge of the event .
however , china expert matthias von hein says china does not have as much control as critics think .
" china is in a strange position at this book fair because it has been willing to present itself there , knowing that the frankfurt book fair is an event that can not be totally controlled by the propaganda department , " he said .
he added that there are many chinese writers in attendance at these events who have drawn the ire of chinese officials .
press freedom in the " new " china while china 's economic boom has made it a more formidable presence on the world stage - as was demonstrated by its hosting of the 2008 summer olympic games - it still struggles with what face to put forward - one of a modern , open society or one that resembles more of the " old " china . bildunterschrift : critics accused china of using the olympic games as a pr event while at the same time suppressing criticism and dissent within china liao yiwu 's work is still unavailable in his homeland .
and though he is dismayed by his travel ban , he vows never to stop expressing his views .
" even if the authorities try to censor me , i will continue to work .
at least if people read my book , i 'll have made an impact , " he said .
although there has been much controversy surrounding the choice of china as a guest country for the frankfurt book fair , stemming from the past weeks ' events , matthias von hein believes this is a good step for both germany and china .

dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

" " if the collapse of the berlin wall marked a watershed in world history , it did all the more so for the countries of central and eastern europe , enabling them to take their rightful place as sovereign actors in the concert of nations , " the pontiff said . the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 . the visit by benedict is a sojourn to the most secular country in europe and comes shortly before the 20th anniversary of the velvet revolution , the peaceful coup which toppled the communist regime of former czechoslovakia . religious beliefs , and especially their display , were banned in communist czechoslovakia , which viewed the church , and religion as a whole , as an enemy of the people .
the regime kept priests under police surveillance and suppressed catholic publications and associations . bildunterschrift : the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 on the sidelines of the papal visit , vatican and czech representatives also discussed the sensitive issue of returning church property confiscated by the communists after world war ii .
a large number of churches , chapels , monasteries , agricultural land and artwork were nationalized by the czech regime at the time . pontiff confronts widely atheist public the pope , however , faces an uphill struggle to bring a religious revival to the country , despite the fall of communism . nearly 60 percent of czechs do not identify with any religion , according to a census taken in 2001 , up from 39 percent a decade earlier , putting the czech republic in stark contrast to neighboring and deeply devout poland .
the percentage of believers , on the other hand , dropped sharply between 1991 and 2001 from almost 44 percent to 32 percent , according to figures from the czech statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few czechs identify with religion but enough came to celebrate mass with the pope that has not deterred the pontiff , however , who said prior to his visit that " after going through the dramas of the past century , -lrb- the czech republic -rrb- needs , like the rest of the continent , to rediscover the reasons for faith and for hope . " church data indicates that there are also more people of faith than the government statistics show , according to jana michalkova , a spokeswoman for the diocese in litomerice , some 80 kilometers north of prague .
but , michalkova admits that half of the churches and chapels in her area were in very poor condition and some sunday masses " served just one or two people . " benedict not visiting former ethnic german region the pope 's agenda in the czech republic includes stopovers in prague , the southeastern city of brno and stara boleslav just outside prague . he will not be visiting the country 's western sudeten region , which was once mostly inhabited by ethnic germans , who were driven from their homes and fled to germany and austria after world war ii . the expulsion of the ethnic german catholics only accelerated the decline of religion in the post-war era and has been a frequent thorn in relations between the czech republic and germany . gb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2009 german voters head to the polls in tight election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62.2 million germans are eligible to vote germans are voting in a keenly-watched national election with chancellor angela merkel likely to win a second term at the helm of europe 's largest economy .
initial voter turnout , however , was lower than in 2005 . despite bright sunshine in large parts of the country , fewer germans turned out to cast their ballots than at the last election , according to the electoral commissioner .
by 12 pm gmt , 36.1 percent of voters had cast their ballots , down from 41.9 percent at the same time in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initial voter turnout was sluggish in total , 62.2 million germans are entitled to vote for 28 parties seeking to enter the lower house of parliament , or bundestag . preliminary exit poll results are expected around 4 pm gmt .
security has been tightened throughout the country on election day in the wake of a series of warnings by islamic militants , including one from al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the messages call on germany to pull some 4,200 troops out of afghanistan . merkel the clear favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's lead has diminished in recent weeks chancellor angela merkel remains the clear favorite to win a second term in power .
but it 's unclear whether she will get the center-right government she says is needed to lift europe 's largest economy out of its worst slump in 60 years . merkel 's conservatives have been in an awkward " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for the past four years . merkel 's main rival in sunday 's vote is the leader of the spd and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier . the chancellor enjoys high popularity ratings , and opinion polls in recent weeks have given her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- a 8-11 point advantage over their center-left rivals .
the conservatives ' preferred coalition partner is the reform-minded business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . should the conservatives , however , fail to win enough support to team up with the fdp , merkel will probably be forced into the same uneasy right-left partnership she has presided over since 2005 . both candidates remain optimistic latest opinion polls show that a continuation of the " grand coalition " could be a likely outcome .
merkel 's lead has shrunk in recent weeks .
a poll by the forsa institute published two days before the vote showed her preferred coalition at 47 percent - not necessarily enough to clinch a clear majority under germany 's complex electoral system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to turn around his party 's fortunes but merkel remained upbeat on the eve of the election .
" i am always optimistic , " she told mass-circulation newspaper bild am sonntag . " voters will decide tomorrow how quickly we get out of this crisis , " merkel told a final rally on saturday .
" we are fighting for the german jobs of the future .

initial voter turnout , however , was lower than in 2005 . despite bright sunshine in large parts of the country , fewer germans turned out to cast their ballots than at the last election , according to the electoral commissioner .
by 12 pm gmt , 36.1 percent of voters had cast their ballots , down from 41.9 percent at the same time in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initial voter turnout was sluggish in total , 62.2 million germans are entitled to vote for 28 parties seeking to enter the lower house of parliament , or bundestag . preliminary exit poll results are expected around 4 pm gmt .
security has been tightened throughout the country on election day in the wake of a series of warnings by islamic militants , including one from al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the messages call on germany to pull some 4,200 troops out of afghanistan . merkel the clear favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's lead has diminished in recent weeks chancellor angela merkel remains the clear favorite to win a second term in power .
but it 's unclear whether she will get the center-right government she says is needed to lift europe 's largest economy out of its worst slump in 60 years . merkel 's conservatives have been in an awkward " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for the past four years . merkel 's main rival in sunday 's vote is the leader of the spd and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier . the chancellor enjoys high popularity ratings , and opinion polls in recent weeks have given her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- a 8-11 point advantage over their center-left rivals .
the conservatives ' preferred coalition partner is the reform-minded business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . should the conservatives , however , fail to win enough support to team up with the fdp , merkel will probably be forced into the same uneasy right-left partnership she has presided over since 2005 . both candidates remain optimistic latest opinion polls show that a continuation of the " grand coalition " could be a likely outcome .
merkel 's lead has shrunk in recent weeks .
a poll by the forsa institute published two days before the vote showed her preferred coalition at 47 percent - not necessarily enough to clinch a clear majority under germany 's complex electoral system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to turn around his party 's fortunes but merkel remained upbeat on the eve of the election .
" i am always optimistic , " she told mass-circulation newspaper bild am sonntag . " voters will decide tomorrow how quickly we get out of this crisis , " merkel told a final rally on saturday .
" we are fighting for the german jobs of the future . " steinmeier , merkel 's rival for the top job , also sounded confident despite a risk that his party could score under the post-war low of 28.8 percent it received in 1953 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2009 do german political parties have too much money ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political parties will likely spend over 60 million euros , much of it on advertising with german election campaigns becoming more expensive , political parties have adopted american-style tactics , such as asking for small donations online .
what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .

" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.09.2009 germany goes to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler is one of 62 million germans eligble to vote with polling stations open , germans are voting in general elections .
chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .
seeking a new alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " angie " is likely to win a second term in office , but she will need a coalition partner this time , merkel is hoping to garner enough votes to form an alliance with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "
a grand-coalition revival ?
the spd candidate frank-walter steinmeier has been gaining ground in the past few days .
and although there is every indication that merkel will win a second term in office , there has been increasing talk of another round of the grand-coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's supporters think that germany would be better off without " angie " in a speech to voters in dresden on saturday , steinmeier warned voters against electing a center-right government .
" those who do n't want this country to be torn apart into winners and losers must go and vote tomorrow , " he said .
" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .
in a letter published in the mass circulation bild am sonntag newspaper on election day , the german president horst koehler has appealed to the electorate not to be apathetic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters can come down as it 's up to the electorate now " non-voters are not represented in parliament , " koehler said .

" " if the collapse of the berlin wall marked a watershed in world history , it did all the more so for the countries of central and eastern europe , enabling them to take their rightful place as sovereign actors in the concert of nations , " the pontiff said . the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 . the visit by benedict is a sojourn to the most secular country in europe and comes shortly before the 20th anniversary of the velvet revolution , the peaceful coup which toppled the communist regime of former czechoslovakia . religious beliefs , and especially their display , were banned in communist czechoslovakia , which viewed the church , and religion as a whole , as an enemy of the people .
the regime kept priests under police surveillance and suppressed catholic publications and associations . bildunterschrift : the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 on the sidelines of the papal visit , vatican and czech representatives also discussed the sensitive issue of returning church property confiscated by the communists after world war ii .
a large number of churches , chapels , monasteries , agricultural land and artwork were nationalized by the czech regime at the time . pontiff confronts widely atheist public the pope , however , faces an uphill struggle to bring a religious revival to the country , despite the fall of communism . nearly 60 percent of czechs do not identify with any religion , according to a census taken in 2001 , up from 39 percent a decade earlier , putting the czech republic in stark contrast to neighboring and deeply devout poland .
the percentage of believers , on the other hand , dropped sharply between 1991 and 2001 from almost 44 percent to 32 percent , according to figures from the czech statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few czechs identify with religion but enough came to celebrate mass with the pope that has not deterred the pontiff , however , who said prior to his visit that " after going through the dramas of the past century , -lrb- the czech republic -rrb- needs , like the rest of the continent , to rediscover the reasons for faith and for hope . " church data indicates that there are also more people of faith than the government statistics show , according to jana michalkova , a spokeswoman for the diocese in litomerice , some 80 kilometers north of prague .
but , michalkova admits that half of the churches and chapels in her area were in very poor condition and some sunday masses " served just one or two people . " benedict not visiting former ethnic german region the pope 's agenda in the czech republic includes stopovers in prague , the southeastern city of brno and stara boleslav just outside prague . he will not be visiting the country 's western sudeten region , which was once mostly inhabited by ethnic germans , who were driven from their homes and fled to germany and austria after world war ii . the expulsion of the ethnic german catholics only accelerated the decline of religion in the post-war era and has been a frequent thorn in relations between the czech republic and germany . gb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2009 opinion : new government faces tough task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a new government with the pro-business fdp .
dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

but it 's unclear whether she will get the center-right government she says is needed to lift europe 's largest economy out of its worst slump in 60 years . merkel 's conservatives have been in an awkward " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for the past four years . merkel 's main rival in sunday 's vote is the leader of the spd and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier . the chancellor enjoys high popularity ratings , and opinion polls in recent weeks have given her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- a 8-11 point advantage over their center-left rivals .
the conservatives ' preferred coalition partner is the reform-minded business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . should the conservatives , however , fail to win enough support to team up with the fdp , merkel will probably be forced into the same uneasy right-left partnership she has presided over since 2005 . both candidates remain optimistic latest opinion polls show that a continuation of the " grand coalition " could be a likely outcome .
merkel 's lead has shrunk in recent weeks .
a poll by the forsa institute published two days before the vote showed her preferred coalition at 47 percent - not necessarily enough to clinch a clear majority under germany 's complex electoral system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to turn around his party 's fortunes but merkel remained upbeat on the eve of the election .
" i am always optimistic , " she told mass-circulation newspaper bild am sonntag . " voters will decide tomorrow how quickly we get out of this crisis , " merkel told a final rally on saturday .
" we are fighting for the german jobs of the future . " steinmeier , merkel 's rival for the top job , also sounded confident despite a risk that his party could score under the post-war low of 28.8 percent it received in 1953 . " i 've felt a great amount of support and a lot of interest in our cause .
and that 's why i 'm very , very confident about today , " steinmeier told reporters after he cast his vote in berlin on sunday . sp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw looks back at the last four years . if chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- forge a new center-right government with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , it would spell the end of the four-year alliance with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
deutsche welle looks back at the last four years and the record of the grand coalition .
two big parties means little opposition elected in the autumn of 2005 to replace the spd-green coalition of then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , merkel and her deputy , steinmeier , set about turning former political foes into friends and tackling a long list of unfinished business .
at the time , merkel said the new cdu-spd coalition offered " an opportunity to overcome the economic crisis and advance reforms . "
since then , the grand coalition , facing only a small and ideologically divided opposition in parliament , has pushed through a wide range of legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is one of the few things merkel and steinmeier disagree on in the area of finance and economic reform , the grand coalition introduced the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , increasing the sales tax from 16 to 19 percent .
the government raised the pension age to 67 from 65 to offset the costs of an aging population .
it also extended the minimum wage to new sectors of the economy , but did not introduce a blanket minimum for everybody .
rising to the challenges of the economic crisis it successfully reined in budget deficits , only to see the savings evaporate in the face of the global economic crisis and is now sitting atop the biggest deficit germany has ever had .
to combat the economic meltdown the government passed two stimulus packages worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- .
it also set up a mammoth 500-billion-euro bank rescue plan to boost liquidity , and a 100-billion-euro " bad bank " plan to relieve banks of their toxic assets .
it introduced a much-copied " cash-for-clunkers " program to help the auto industry out of a serious sales slump .
the coalition also jumped to the rescue of german carmaker , opel , a subsidiary of us automaker , general motors .
the deal , according to the german weekly magazine , der spiegel , was so important to merkel that she told us president barack obama that it was " a test case for transatlantic relations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel meeting the dalai lama strained relations between berlin and beijing mixed reviews on foreign policy those relations would indeed be tested in the foreign policy sector .
the coalition first mended ties with the united states , which were sorely strained over the iraq war .
merkel then took a critical approach toward russia and china on human rights issues and caused outrage in beijing in 2007 by meeting the dalai lama .
however , the coalition has since been sharply criticized for its all-too chummy relationship with moscow , especially in the energy sector .
these ties prompted finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb to comment that germany has " weakened the unity of the european union . "
merkel and steinmeier have also been taken to task for their contradictory relationship to nato .
on the one hand , germany is participating in naval monitoring missions off the coast of lebanon and the horn of africa , but has been very reticent to get more involved in afghanistan , where it has about 4,200 troops in a mostly non-combat capacity .
coalition pushes climate agenda merkel did , however , earn considerable kudos for her six-month role as head of the eu presidency .
she got eu and g-8 members to tackle climate change and laid the groundwork for the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
back on the home front , the grand coalition introduced steps for germany to cut its co2 emissions by more than a third by 2020 and boosted efforts to promote renewable energy sources .
but , the cdu and spd remain starkly divided over the issue of nuclear energy and whether or not to keep or extend a planned phase-out by 2030. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

controversy surrounding frankfurt book fair the event at the berlin house of world cultures is one of several connected with the frankfurt book fair , which takes place from october 14-18 .
china has been invited to be this year 's guest nation , but organizers in germany are finding it difficult to work with a country that limits press freedom .
two weeks ago , two chinese dissident writers had their invitations to the frankfurt book fair revoked by german organizers , after china 's organizing committee complained .
the move angered many in germany who felt china was taking charge of the event .
however , china expert matthias von hein says china does not have as much control as critics think .
" china is in a strange position at this book fair because it has been willing to present itself there , knowing that the frankfurt book fair is an event that can not be totally controlled by the propaganda department , " he said .
he added that there are many chinese writers in attendance at these events who have drawn the ire of chinese officials .

dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .
seeking a new alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " angie " is likely to win a second term in office , but she will need a coalition partner this time , merkel is hoping to garner enough votes to form an alliance with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "
a grand-coalition revival ?
the spd candidate frank-walter steinmeier has been gaining ground in the past few days .
and although there is every indication that merkel will win a second term in office , there has been increasing talk of another round of the grand-coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's supporters think that germany would be better off without " angie " in a speech to voters in dresden on saturday , steinmeier warned voters against electing a center-right government .
" those who do n't want this country to be torn apart into winners and losers must go and vote tomorrow , " he said .
" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .
in a letter published in the mass circulation bild am sonntag newspaper on election day , the german president horst koehler has appealed to the electorate not to be apathetic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters can come down as it 's up to the electorate now " non-voters are not represented in parliament , " koehler said .
" if you do n't vote , there is nobody in parliament to put forward your concerns , " he played on the collective conscience of the modern electorate , reminding voters that their right to have their say was not always a given .
" people died in the name of free , secret and equal voting rights , " he said .
" it is our democracy and we should n't weaken it . " tkw / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

initial voter turnout , however , was lower than in 2005 . despite bright sunshine in large parts of the country , fewer germans turned out to cast their ballots than at the last election , according to the electoral commissioner .
by 12 pm gmt , 36.1 percent of voters had cast their ballots , down from 41.9 percent at the same time in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initial voter turnout was sluggish in total , 62.2 million germans are entitled to vote for 28 parties seeking to enter the lower house of parliament , or bundestag . preliminary exit poll results are expected around 4 pm gmt .
security has been tightened throughout the country on election day in the wake of a series of warnings by islamic militants , including one from al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the messages call on germany to pull some 4,200 troops out of afghanistan . merkel the clear favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's lead has diminished in recent weeks chancellor angela merkel remains the clear favorite to win a second term in power .
but it 's unclear whether she will get the center-right government she says is needed to lift europe 's largest economy out of its worst slump in 60 years . merkel 's conservatives have been in an awkward " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for the past four years . merkel 's main rival in sunday 's vote is the leader of the spd and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier . the chancellor enjoys high popularity ratings , and opinion polls in recent weeks have given her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- a 8-11 point advantage over their center-left rivals .
the conservatives ' preferred coalition partner is the reform-minded business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . should the conservatives , however , fail to win enough support to team up with the fdp , merkel will probably be forced into the same uneasy right-left partnership she has presided over since 2005 . both candidates remain optimistic latest opinion polls show that a continuation of the " grand coalition " could be a likely outcome .
merkel 's lead has shrunk in recent weeks .
a poll by the forsa institute published two days before the vote showed her preferred coalition at 47 percent - not necessarily enough to clinch a clear majority under germany 's complex electoral system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to turn around his party 's fortunes but merkel remained upbeat on the eve of the election .
" i am always optimistic , " she told mass-circulation newspaper bild am sonntag . " voters will decide tomorrow how quickly we get out of this crisis , " merkel told a final rally on saturday .
" we are fighting for the german jobs of the future . " steinmeier , merkel 's rival for the top job , also sounded confident despite a risk that his party could score under the post-war low of 28.8 percent it received in 1953 . " i 've felt a great amount of support and a lot of interest in our cause .

dw looks back at the last four years . if chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- forge a new center-right government with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , it would spell the end of the four-year alliance with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
deutsche welle looks back at the last four years and the record of the grand coalition .
two big parties means little opposition elected in the autumn of 2005 to replace the spd-green coalition of then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , merkel and her deputy , steinmeier , set about turning former political foes into friends and tackling a long list of unfinished business .
at the time , merkel said the new cdu-spd coalition offered " an opportunity to overcome the economic crisis and advance reforms . "
since then , the grand coalition , facing only a small and ideologically divided opposition in parliament , has pushed through a wide range of legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is one of the few things merkel and steinmeier disagree on in the area of finance and economic reform , the grand coalition introduced the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , increasing the sales tax from 16 to 19 percent .
the government raised the pension age to 67 from 65 to offset the costs of an aging population .
it also extended the minimum wage to new sectors of the economy , but did not introduce a blanket minimum for everybody .
rising to the challenges of the economic crisis it successfully reined in budget deficits , only to see the savings evaporate in the face of the global economic crisis and is now sitting atop the biggest deficit germany has ever had .
to combat the economic meltdown the government passed two stimulus packages worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- .
it also set up a mammoth 500-billion-euro bank rescue plan to boost liquidity , and a 100-billion-euro " bad bank " plan to relieve banks of their toxic assets .
it introduced a much-copied " cash-for-clunkers " program to help the auto industry out of a serious sales slump .
the coalition also jumped to the rescue of german carmaker , opel , a subsidiary of us automaker , general motors .
the deal , according to the german weekly magazine , der spiegel , was so important to merkel that she told us president barack obama that it was " a test case for transatlantic relations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel meeting the dalai lama strained relations between berlin and beijing mixed reviews on foreign policy those relations would indeed be tested in the foreign policy sector .
the coalition first mended ties with the united states , which were sorely strained over the iraq war .
merkel then took a critical approach toward russia and china on human rights issues and caused outrage in beijing in 2007 by meeting the dalai lama .
however , the coalition has since been sharply criticized for its all-too chummy relationship with moscow , especially in the energy sector .
these ties prompted finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb to comment that germany has " weakened the unity of the european union . "
merkel and steinmeier have also been taken to task for their contradictory relationship to nato .
on the one hand , germany is participating in naval monitoring missions off the coast of lebanon and the horn of africa , but has been very reticent to get more involved in afghanistan , where it has about 4,200 troops in a mostly non-combat capacity .
coalition pushes climate agenda merkel did , however , earn considerable kudos for her six-month role as head of the eu presidency .
she got eu and g-8 members to tackle climate change and laid the groundwork for the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
back on the home front , the grand coalition introduced steps for germany to cut its co2 emissions by more than a third by 2020 and boosted efforts to promote renewable energy sources .
but , the cdu and spd remain starkly divided over the issue of nuclear energy and whether or not to keep or extend a planned phase-out by 2030. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" she is perceived as an almost presidential figure , " said peter matuschek of the forsa polling group .
" she has always relied heavily on her performance on the international stage .
she has given a very statesman-like impression . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's backstory does n't quite match that of south africa 's nelson mandela - germans like her anyway her success might seem strange to those in countries where politicians need to be bigger than life to be elected , or should have the soaring rhetoric of barack obama to motivate , the hyperactive energy of france 's nicolas sarkozy to energize , or the inspiring back-story of someone like nelson mandela to inspire .
those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver hearing merkel speak at a party conference in the run-up to the sept .
27 election , there is no high-flying rhetoric or emotive outbursts to work up the crowd .
she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela kasner , later merkel , in 1973 merkel was born in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
when she was a baby , her father moved the family to east germany .
while it is thought that her family had a friendly enough relationship with the communist regime there , her father 's profession did raise suspicions .
merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to be always her best .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state .
michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " around her domestic agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with frank-walter steinmeier , current foreign minister and electoral opponent during the last four years , she was hobbled somewhat by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . " the chancellor is increasing pensions , the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious german out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political science professor at berlin 's free university . the authenticity factor while merkel is a conservative , she does n't strike people as the fire-and-brimstone kind .
that could be part of her appeal even to young people , according to thomas schneider of the junge union , the youth wing of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
in his opinion , merkel – with her pantsuits and somewhat plodding demeanor – is appreciated for who she is .
it 's a welcome change from glad-handing , million-dollar-smile politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not seen as an archconservative by many " i think that the young generation is expecting authentic people and i do n't think they are looking for someone in their mid-50s or 60s who is playing for them on a playstation " schneider said . he says inspiration also comes from her success in the middle of a party dominated by catholic men -lrb- two things she is not -rrb- , which not so long ago thought women should chair church committees , not g-8 conferences .
merkel , who entered politics only in 1990 , broke that mold . " it 's very impressive how someone can make such enormous progress in such a short time , " he said .
" it 's breathtaking . " author : kyle james editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver hearing merkel speak at a party conference in the run-up to the sept .

she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela kasner , later merkel , in 1973 merkel was born in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
when she was a baby , her father moved the family to east germany .
while it is thought that her family had a friendly enough relationship with the communist regime there , her father 's profession did raise suspicions .
merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to be always her best .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .

michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " around her domestic agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with frank-walter steinmeier , current foreign minister and electoral opponent during the last four years , she was hobbled somewhat by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . " the chancellor is increasing pensions , the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious german out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political science professor at berlin 's free university . the authenticity factor while merkel is a conservative , she does n't strike people as the fire-and-brimstone kind .
that could be part of her appeal even to young people , according to thomas schneider of the junge union , the youth wing of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
in his opinion , merkel – with her pantsuits and somewhat plodding demeanor – is appreciated for who she is .

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .
" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .
" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .
" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.09.2009 germany goes to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler is one of 62 million germans eligble to vote with polling stations open , germans are voting in general elections .
chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .
seeking a new alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " angie " is likely to win a second term in office , but she will need a coalition partner this time , merkel is hoping to garner enough votes to form an alliance with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "
a grand-coalition revival ?
the spd candidate frank-walter steinmeier has been gaining ground in the past few days .
and although there is every indication that merkel will win a second term in office , there has been increasing talk of another round of the grand-coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's supporters think that germany would be better off without " angie " in a speech to voters in dresden on saturday , steinmeier warned voters against electing a center-right government .
" those who do n't want this country to be torn apart into winners and losers must go and vote tomorrow , " he said .
" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .
in a letter published in the mass circulation bild am sonntag newspaper on election day , the german president horst koehler has appealed to the electorate not to be apathetic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters can come down as it 's up to the electorate now " non-voters are not represented in parliament , " koehler said .
" if you do n't vote , there is nobody in parliament to put forward your concerns , " he played on the collective conscience of the modern electorate , reminding voters that their right to have their say was not always a given .
" people died in the name of free , secret and equal voting rights , " he said .
" it is our democracy and we should n't weaken it . " tkw / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2009 opinion : new government faces tough task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a new government with the pro-business fdp .
dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2009 opinion : new government faces tough task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a new government with the pro-business fdp .
dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

" " if the collapse of the berlin wall marked a watershed in world history , it did all the more so for the countries of central and eastern europe , enabling them to take their rightful place as sovereign actors in the concert of nations , " the pontiff said . the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 . the visit by benedict is a sojourn to the most secular country in europe and comes shortly before the 20th anniversary of the velvet revolution , the peaceful coup which toppled the communist regime of former czechoslovakia . religious beliefs , and especially their display , were banned in communist czechoslovakia , which viewed the church , and religion as a whole , as an enemy of the people .
the regime kept priests under police surveillance and suppressed catholic publications and associations . bildunterschrift : the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 on the sidelines of the papal visit , vatican and czech representatives also discussed the sensitive issue of returning church property confiscated by the communists after world war ii .
a large number of churches , chapels , monasteries , agricultural land and artwork were nationalized by the czech regime at the time . pontiff confronts widely atheist public the pope , however , faces an uphill struggle to bring a religious revival to the country , despite the fall of communism . nearly 60 percent of czechs do not identify with any religion , according to a census taken in 2001 , up from 39 percent a decade earlier , putting the czech republic in stark contrast to neighboring and deeply devout poland .
the percentage of believers , on the other hand , dropped sharply between 1991 and 2001 from almost 44 percent to 32 percent , according to figures from the czech statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few czechs identify with religion but enough came to celebrate mass with the pope that has not deterred the pontiff , however , who said prior to his visit that " after going through the dramas of the past century , -lrb- the czech republic -rrb- needs , like the rest of the continent , to rediscover the reasons for faith and for hope . " church data indicates that there are also more people of faith than the government statistics show , according to jana michalkova , a spokeswoman for the diocese in litomerice , some 80 kilometers north of prague .
but , michalkova admits that half of the churches and chapels in her area were in very poor condition and some sunday masses " served just one or two people . " benedict not visiting former ethnic german region the pope 's agenda in the czech republic includes stopovers in prague , the southeastern city of brno and stara boleslav just outside prague . he will not be visiting the country 's western sudeten region , which was once mostly inhabited by ethnic germans , who were driven from their homes and fled to germany and austria after world war ii . the expulsion of the ethnic german catholics only accelerated the decline of religion in the post-war era and has been a frequent thorn in relations between the czech republic and germany . gb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.09.2009 germany goes to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler is one of 62 million germans eligble to vote with polling stations open , germans are voting in general elections .
chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .
seeking a new alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " angie " is likely to win a second term in office , but she will need a coalition partner this time , merkel is hoping to garner enough votes to form an alliance with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "
a grand-coalition revival ?
the spd candidate frank-walter steinmeier has been gaining ground in the past few days .
and although there is every indication that merkel will win a second term in office , there has been increasing talk of another round of the grand-coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's supporters think that germany would be better off without " angie " in a speech to voters in dresden on saturday , steinmeier warned voters against electing a center-right government .
" those who do n't want this country to be torn apart into winners and losers must go and vote tomorrow , " he said .
" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .
in a letter published in the mass circulation bild am sonntag newspaper on election day , the german president horst koehler has appealed to the electorate not to be apathetic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters can come down as it 's up to the electorate now " non-voters are not represented in parliament , " koehler said .
" if you do n't vote , there is nobody in parliament to put forward your concerns , " he played on the collective conscience of the modern electorate , reminding voters that their right to have their say was not always a given .
" people died in the name of free , secret and equal voting rights , " he said .
" it is our democracy and we should n't weaken it . " tkw / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .

" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2009 opinion : new government faces tough task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a new government with the pro-business fdp .
dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

" " if the collapse of the berlin wall marked a watershed in world history , it did all the more so for the countries of central and eastern europe , enabling them to take their rightful place as sovereign actors in the concert of nations , " the pontiff said . the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 . the visit by benedict is a sojourn to the most secular country in europe and comes shortly before the 20th anniversary of the velvet revolution , the peaceful coup which toppled the communist regime of former czechoslovakia . religious beliefs , and especially their display , were banned in communist czechoslovakia , which viewed the church , and religion as a whole , as an enemy of the people .
the regime kept priests under police surveillance and suppressed catholic publications and associations . bildunterschrift : the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 on the sidelines of the papal visit , vatican and czech representatives also discussed the sensitive issue of returning church property confiscated by the communists after world war ii .
a large number of churches , chapels , monasteries , agricultural land and artwork were nationalized by the czech regime at the time . pontiff confronts widely atheist public the pope , however , faces an uphill struggle to bring a religious revival to the country , despite the fall of communism . nearly 60 percent of czechs do not identify with any religion , according to a census taken in 2001 , up from 39 percent a decade earlier , putting the czech republic in stark contrast to neighboring and deeply devout poland .
the percentage of believers , on the other hand , dropped sharply between 1991 and 2001 from almost 44 percent to 32 percent , according to figures from the czech statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few czechs identify with religion but enough came to celebrate mass with the pope that has not deterred the pontiff , however , who said prior to his visit that " after going through the dramas of the past century , -lrb- the czech republic -rrb- needs , like the rest of the continent , to rediscover the reasons for faith and for hope . " church data indicates that there are also more people of faith than the government statistics show , according to jana michalkova , a spokeswoman for the diocese in litomerice , some 80 kilometers north of prague .
but , michalkova admits that half of the churches and chapels in her area were in very poor condition and some sunday masses " served just one or two people . " benedict not visiting former ethnic german region the pope 's agenda in the czech republic includes stopovers in prague , the southeastern city of brno and stara boleslav just outside prague . he will not be visiting the country 's western sudeten region , which was once mostly inhabited by ethnic germans , who were driven from their homes and fled to germany and austria after world war ii . the expulsion of the ethnic german catholics only accelerated the decline of religion in the post-war era and has been a frequent thorn in relations between the czech republic and germany . gb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle looks back at the last four years and the record of the grand coalition .
two big parties means little opposition elected in the autumn of 2005 to replace the spd-green coalition of then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , merkel and her deputy , steinmeier , set about turning former political foes into friends and tackling a long list of unfinished business .
at the time , merkel said the new cdu-spd coalition offered " an opportunity to overcome the economic crisis and advance reforms . "
since then , the grand coalition , facing only a small and ideologically divided opposition in parliament , has pushed through a wide range of legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is one of the few things merkel and steinmeier disagree on in the area of finance and economic reform , the grand coalition introduced the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , increasing the sales tax from 16 to 19 percent .
the government raised the pension age to 67 from 65 to offset the costs of an aging population .
it also extended the minimum wage to new sectors of the economy , but did not introduce a blanket minimum for everybody .
rising to the challenges of the economic crisis it successfully reined in budget deficits , only to see the savings evaporate in the face of the global economic crisis and is now sitting atop the biggest deficit germany has ever had .
to combat the economic meltdown the government passed two stimulus packages worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- .
it also set up a mammoth 500-billion-euro bank rescue plan to boost liquidity , and a 100-billion-euro " bad bank " plan to relieve banks of their toxic assets .
it introduced a much-copied " cash-for-clunkers " program to help the auto industry out of a serious sales slump .
the coalition also jumped to the rescue of german carmaker , opel , a subsidiary of us automaker , general motors .

the coalition first mended ties with the united states , which were sorely strained over the iraq war .
merkel then took a critical approach toward russia and china on human rights issues and caused outrage in beijing in 2007 by meeting the dalai lama .
however , the coalition has since been sharply criticized for its all-too chummy relationship with moscow , especially in the energy sector .
these ties prompted finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb to comment that germany has " weakened the unity of the european union . "
merkel and steinmeier have also been taken to task for their contradictory relationship to nato .
on the one hand , germany is participating in naval monitoring missions off the coast of lebanon and the horn of africa , but has been very reticent to get more involved in afghanistan , where it has about 4,200 troops in a mostly non-combat capacity .

she got eu and g-8 members to tackle climate change and laid the groundwork for the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
back on the home front , the grand coalition introduced steps for germany to cut its co2 emissions by more than a third by 2020 and boosted efforts to promote renewable energy sources .

what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .

dw looks back at the last four years . if chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- forge a new center-right government with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , it would spell the end of the four-year alliance with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
deutsche welle looks back at the last four years and the record of the grand coalition .
two big parties means little opposition elected in the autumn of 2005 to replace the spd-green coalition of then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , merkel and her deputy , steinmeier , set about turning former political foes into friends and tackling a long list of unfinished business .
at the time , merkel said the new cdu-spd coalition offered " an opportunity to overcome the economic crisis and advance reforms . "
since then , the grand coalition , facing only a small and ideologically divided opposition in parliament , has pushed through a wide range of legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is one of the few things merkel and steinmeier disagree on in the area of finance and economic reform , the grand coalition introduced the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , increasing the sales tax from 16 to 19 percent .
the government raised the pension age to 67 from 65 to offset the costs of an aging population .
it also extended the minimum wage to new sectors of the economy , but did not introduce a blanket minimum for everybody .
rising to the challenges of the economic crisis it successfully reined in budget deficits , only to see the savings evaporate in the face of the global economic crisis and is now sitting atop the biggest deficit germany has ever had .
to combat the economic meltdown the government passed two stimulus packages worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- .
it also set up a mammoth 500-billion-euro bank rescue plan to boost liquidity , and a 100-billion-euro " bad bank " plan to relieve banks of their toxic assets .
it introduced a much-copied " cash-for-clunkers " program to help the auto industry out of a serious sales slump .
the coalition also jumped to the rescue of german carmaker , opel , a subsidiary of us automaker , general motors .
the deal , according to the german weekly magazine , der spiegel , was so important to merkel that she told us president barack obama that it was " a test case for transatlantic relations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel meeting the dalai lama strained relations between berlin and beijing mixed reviews on foreign policy those relations would indeed be tested in the foreign policy sector .
the coalition first mended ties with the united states , which were sorely strained over the iraq war .
merkel then took a critical approach toward russia and china on human rights issues and caused outrage in beijing in 2007 by meeting the dalai lama .
however , the coalition has since been sharply criticized for its all-too chummy relationship with moscow , especially in the energy sector .
these ties prompted finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb to comment that germany has " weakened the unity of the european union . "
merkel and steinmeier have also been taken to task for their contradictory relationship to nato .
on the one hand , germany is participating in naval monitoring missions off the coast of lebanon and the horn of africa , but has been very reticent to get more involved in afghanistan , where it has about 4,200 troops in a mostly non-combat capacity .
coalition pushes climate agenda merkel did , however , earn considerable kudos for her six-month role as head of the eu presidency .
she got eu and g-8 members to tackle climate change and laid the groundwork for the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
back on the home front , the grand coalition introduced steps for germany to cut its co2 emissions by more than a third by 2020 and boosted efforts to promote renewable energy sources .
but , the cdu and spd remain starkly divided over the issue of nuclear energy and whether or not to keep or extend a planned phase-out by 2030. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german and chinese organizers have clashed over attendees . " massacre " is the name of the poem written by liao yiwu that sent him to prison for four years .
in it , he condemned the 1989 killings in tiananmen square .
in his book " the corpse walker " - that 's just been published in german - he tells the stories of people from the bottom-rung of chinese society - from a village teacher to a blind street musician - left behind in the country 's economic boom .
the fifty-year-old chinese musician , reporter , and author , was supposed to travel to berlin next month to participate in a panel discussion at the berlin house of world cultures .
but , he says , chinese authorities have banned him from traveling .
" chinese state security officials told me that i will not be allowed to fly to germany , " liao was quoted in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's books are available in germany - not in china " for people in the west , it 's the most normal thing in the world to be able to write freely .
in china , we have to fight for this , " he told deutsche welle .
controversy surrounding frankfurt book fair the event at the berlin house of world cultures is one of several connected with the frankfurt book fair , which takes place from october 14-18 .
china has been invited to be this year 's guest nation , but organizers in germany are finding it difficult to work with a country that limits press freedom .
two weeks ago , two chinese dissident writers had their invitations to the frankfurt book fair revoked by german organizers , after china 's organizing committee complained .
the move angered many in germany who felt china was taking charge of the event .
however , china expert matthias von hein says china does not have as much control as critics think .
" china is in a strange position at this book fair because it has been willing to present itself there , knowing that the frankfurt book fair is an event that can not be totally controlled by the propaganda department , " he said .
he added that there are many chinese writers in attendance at these events who have drawn the ire of chinese officials .
press freedom in the " new " china while china 's economic boom has made it a more formidable presence on the world stage - as was demonstrated by its hosting of the 2008 summer olympic games - it still struggles with what face to put forward - one of a modern , open society or one that resembles more of the " old " china . bildunterschrift : critics accused china of using the olympic games as a pr event while at the same time suppressing criticism and dissent within china liao yiwu 's work is still unavailable in his homeland .
and though he is dismayed by his travel ban , he vows never to stop expressing his views .
" even if the authorities try to censor me , i will continue to work .
at least if people read my book , i 'll have made an impact , " he said .
although there has been much controversy surrounding the choice of china as a guest country for the frankfurt book fair , stemming from the past weeks ' events , matthias von hein believes this is a good step for both germany and china .
" i believe it is always good to challenge chinese partners with different concepts of press freedom , human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
and the more opportunities there are , the better it is . " vj / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

german and chinese organizers have clashed over attendees . " massacre " is the name of the poem written by liao yiwu that sent him to prison for four years .
in it , he condemned the 1989 killings in tiananmen square .
in his book " the corpse walker " - that 's just been published in german - he tells the stories of people from the bottom-rung of chinese society - from a village teacher to a blind street musician - left behind in the country 's economic boom .
the fifty-year-old chinese musician , reporter , and author , was supposed to travel to berlin next month to participate in a panel discussion at the berlin house of world cultures .
but , he says , chinese authorities have banned him from traveling .
" chinese state security officials told me that i will not be allowed to fly to germany , " liao was quoted in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

in china , we have to fight for this , " he told deutsche welle .
controversy surrounding frankfurt book fair the event at the berlin house of world cultures is one of several connected with the frankfurt book fair , which takes place from october 14-18 .
china has been invited to be this year 's guest nation , but organizers in germany are finding it difficult to work with a country that limits press freedom .
two weeks ago , two chinese dissident writers had their invitations to the frankfurt book fair revoked by german organizers , after china 's organizing committee complained .
the move angered many in germany who felt china was taking charge of the event .
however , china expert matthias von hein says china does not have as much control as critics think .
" china is in a strange position at this book fair because it has been willing to present itself there , knowing that the frankfurt book fair is an event that can not be totally controlled by the propaganda department , " he said .
he added that there are many chinese writers in attendance at these events who have drawn the ire of chinese officials .
press freedom in the " new " china while china 's economic boom has made it a more formidable presence on the world stage - as was demonstrated by its hosting of the 2008 summer olympic games - it still struggles with what face to put forward - one of a modern , open society or one that resembles more of the " old " china . bildunterschrift : critics accused china of using the olympic games as a pr event while at the same time suppressing criticism and dissent within china liao yiwu 's work is still unavailable in his homeland .
and though he is dismayed by his travel ban , he vows never to stop expressing his views .
" even if the authorities try to censor me , i will continue to work .
at least if people read my book , i 'll have made an impact , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2009 do german political parties have too much money ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political parties will likely spend over 60 million euros , much of it on advertising with german election campaigns becoming more expensive , political parties have adopted american-style tactics , such as asking for small donations online .
what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

german and chinese organizers have clashed over attendees . " massacre " is the name of the poem written by liao yiwu that sent him to prison for four years .
in it , he condemned the 1989 killings in tiananmen square .
in his book " the corpse walker " - that 's just been published in german - he tells the stories of people from the bottom-rung of chinese society - from a village teacher to a blind street musician - left behind in the country 's economic boom .
the fifty-year-old chinese musician , reporter , and author , was supposed to travel to berlin next month to participate in a panel discussion at the berlin house of world cultures .
but , he says , chinese authorities have banned him from traveling .
" chinese state security officials told me that i will not be allowed to fly to germany , " liao was quoted in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's books are available in germany - not in china " for people in the west , it 's the most normal thing in the world to be able to write freely .
in china , we have to fight for this , " he told deutsche welle .
controversy surrounding frankfurt book fair the event at the berlin house of world cultures is one of several connected with the frankfurt book fair , which takes place from october 14-18 .
china has been invited to be this year 's guest nation , but organizers in germany are finding it difficult to work with a country that limits press freedom .
two weeks ago , two chinese dissident writers had their invitations to the frankfurt book fair revoked by german organizers , after china 's organizing committee complained .
the move angered many in germany who felt china was taking charge of the event .
however , china expert matthias von hein says china does not have as much control as critics think .
" china is in a strange position at this book fair because it has been willing to present itself there , knowing that the frankfurt book fair is an event that can not be totally controlled by the propaganda department , " he said .
he added that there are many chinese writers in attendance at these events who have drawn the ire of chinese officials .
press freedom in the " new " china while china 's economic boom has made it a more formidable presence on the world stage - as was demonstrated by its hosting of the 2008 summer olympic games - it still struggles with what face to put forward - one of a modern , open society or one that resembles more of the " old " china . bildunterschrift : critics accused china of using the olympic games as a pr event while at the same time suppressing criticism and dissent within china liao yiwu 's work is still unavailable in his homeland .
and though he is dismayed by his travel ban , he vows never to stop expressing his views .
" even if the authorities try to censor me , i will continue to work .
at least if people read my book , i 'll have made an impact , " he said .
although there has been much controversy surrounding the choice of china as a guest country for the frankfurt book fair , stemming from the past weeks ' events , matthias von hein believes this is a good step for both germany and china .
" i believe it is always good to challenge chinese partners with different concepts of press freedom , human rights , democracy and the rule of law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2009 do german political parties have too much money ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political parties will likely spend over 60 million euros , much of it on advertising with german election campaigns becoming more expensive , political parties have adopted american-style tactics , such as asking for small donations online .
what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2009 do german political parties have too much money ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political parties will likely spend over 60 million euros , much of it on advertising with german election campaigns becoming more expensive , political parties have adopted american-style tactics , such as asking for small donations online .
what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2009 taking stock of germany 's ' grand coalition ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merke 's cdu comes out ahead of steinmeier 's spd as the results come in , it looks likely that the christian democrats will form a coalition with the business friendly free democrats and thus mark the end of the grand coalition .
dw looks back at the last four years . if chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- forge a new center-right government with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , it would spell the end of the four-year alliance with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
deutsche welle looks back at the last four years and the record of the grand coalition .
two big parties means little opposition elected in the autumn of 2005 to replace the spd-green coalition of then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , merkel and her deputy , steinmeier , set about turning former political foes into friends and tackling a long list of unfinished business .
at the time , merkel said the new cdu-spd coalition offered " an opportunity to overcome the economic crisis and advance reforms . "
since then , the grand coalition , facing only a small and ideologically divided opposition in parliament , has pushed through a wide range of legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is one of the few things merkel and steinmeier disagree on in the area of finance and economic reform , the grand coalition introduced the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , increasing the sales tax from 16 to 19 percent .
the government raised the pension age to 67 from 65 to offset the costs of an aging population .
it also extended the minimum wage to new sectors of the economy , but did not introduce a blanket minimum for everybody .
rising to the challenges of the economic crisis it successfully reined in budget deficits , only to see the savings evaporate in the face of the global economic crisis and is now sitting atop the biggest deficit germany has ever had .
to combat the economic meltdown the government passed two stimulus packages worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- .
it also set up a mammoth 500-billion-euro bank rescue plan to boost liquidity , and a 100-billion-euro " bad bank " plan to relieve banks of their toxic assets .
it introduced a much-copied " cash-for-clunkers " program to help the auto industry out of a serious sales slump .
the coalition also jumped to the rescue of german carmaker , opel , a subsidiary of us automaker , general motors .
the deal , according to the german weekly magazine , der spiegel , was so important to merkel that she told us president barack obama that it was " a test case for transatlantic relations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel meeting the dalai lama strained relations between berlin and beijing mixed reviews on foreign policy those relations would indeed be tested in the foreign policy sector .
the coalition first mended ties with the united states , which were sorely strained over the iraq war .
merkel then took a critical approach toward russia and china on human rights issues and caused outrage in beijing in 2007 by meeting the dalai lama .
however , the coalition has since been sharply criticized for its all-too chummy relationship with moscow , especially in the energy sector .
these ties prompted finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb to comment that germany has " weakened the unity of the european union . "
merkel and steinmeier have also been taken to task for their contradictory relationship to nato .
on the one hand , germany is participating in naval monitoring missions off the coast of lebanon and the horn of africa , but has been very reticent to get more involved in afghanistan , where it has about 4,200 troops in a mostly non-combat capacity .
coalition pushes climate agenda merkel did , however , earn considerable kudos for her six-month role as head of the eu presidency .
she got eu and g-8 members to tackle climate change and laid the groundwork for the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
back on the home front , the grand coalition introduced steps for germany to cut its co2 emissions by more than a third by 2020 and boosted efforts to promote renewable energy sources .
but , the cdu and spd remain starkly divided over the issue of nuclear energy and whether or not to keep or extend a planned phase-out by 2030. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw looks back at the last four years . if chancellor angela merkel and her conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- forge a new center-right government with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , it would spell the end of the four-year alliance with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
deutsche welle looks back at the last four years and the record of the grand coalition .
two big parties means little opposition elected in the autumn of 2005 to replace the spd-green coalition of then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , merkel and her deputy , steinmeier , set about turning former political foes into friends and tackling a long list of unfinished business .
at the time , merkel said the new cdu-spd coalition offered " an opportunity to overcome the economic crisis and advance reforms . "
since then , the grand coalition , facing only a small and ideologically divided opposition in parliament , has pushed through a wide range of legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is one of the few things merkel and steinmeier disagree on in the area of finance and economic reform , the grand coalition introduced the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , increasing the sales tax from 16 to 19 percent .
the government raised the pension age to 67 from 65 to offset the costs of an aging population .
it also extended the minimum wage to new sectors of the economy , but did not introduce a blanket minimum for everybody .
rising to the challenges of the economic crisis it successfully reined in budget deficits , only to see the savings evaporate in the face of the global economic crisis and is now sitting atop the biggest deficit germany has ever had .
to combat the economic meltdown the government passed two stimulus packages worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- .
it also set up a mammoth 500-billion-euro bank rescue plan to boost liquidity , and a 100-billion-euro " bad bank " plan to relieve banks of their toxic assets .
it introduced a much-copied " cash-for-clunkers " program to help the auto industry out of a serious sales slump .
the coalition also jumped to the rescue of german carmaker , opel , a subsidiary of us automaker , general motors .
the deal , according to the german weekly magazine , der spiegel , was so important to merkel that she told us president barack obama that it was " a test case for transatlantic relations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel meeting the dalai lama strained relations between berlin and beijing mixed reviews on foreign policy those relations would indeed be tested in the foreign policy sector .
the coalition first mended ties with the united states , which were sorely strained over the iraq war .
merkel then took a critical approach toward russia and china on human rights issues and caused outrage in beijing in 2007 by meeting the dalai lama .
however , the coalition has since been sharply criticized for its all-too chummy relationship with moscow , especially in the energy sector .
these ties prompted finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb to comment that germany has " weakened the unity of the european union . "
merkel and steinmeier have also been taken to task for their contradictory relationship to nato .
on the one hand , germany is participating in naval monitoring missions off the coast of lebanon and the horn of africa , but has been very reticent to get more involved in afghanistan , where it has about 4,200 troops in a mostly non-combat capacity .
coalition pushes climate agenda merkel did , however , earn considerable kudos for her six-month role as head of the eu presidency .
she got eu and g-8 members to tackle climate change and laid the groundwork for the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
back on the home front , the grand coalition introduced steps for germany to cut its co2 emissions by more than a third by 2020 and boosted efforts to promote renewable energy sources .
but , the cdu and spd remain starkly divided over the issue of nuclear energy and whether or not to keep or extend a planned phase-out by 2030. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german and chinese organizers have clashed over attendees . " massacre " is the name of the poem written by liao yiwu that sent him to prison for four years .
in it , he condemned the 1989 killings in tiananmen square .
in his book " the corpse walker " - that 's just been published in german - he tells the stories of people from the bottom-rung of chinese society - from a village teacher to a blind street musician - left behind in the country 's economic boom .
the fifty-year-old chinese musician , reporter , and author , was supposed to travel to berlin next month to participate in a panel discussion at the berlin house of world cultures .
but , he says , chinese authorities have banned him from traveling .
" chinese state security officials told me that i will not be allowed to fly to germany , " liao was quoted in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's books are available in germany - not in china " for people in the west , it 's the most normal thing in the world to be able to write freely .
in china , we have to fight for this , " he told deutsche welle .
controversy surrounding frankfurt book fair the event at the berlin house of world cultures is one of several connected with the frankfurt book fair , which takes place from october 14-18 .
china has been invited to be this year 's guest nation , but organizers in germany are finding it difficult to work with a country that limits press freedom .
two weeks ago , two chinese dissident writers had their invitations to the frankfurt book fair revoked by german organizers , after china 's organizing committee complained .
the move angered many in germany who felt china was taking charge of the event .
however , china expert matthias von hein says china does not have as much control as critics think .
" china is in a strange position at this book fair because it has been willing to present itself there , knowing that the frankfurt book fair is an event that can not be totally controlled by the propaganda department , " he said .
he added that there are many chinese writers in attendance at these events who have drawn the ire of chinese officials .
press freedom in the " new " china while china 's economic boom has made it a more formidable presence on the world stage - as was demonstrated by its hosting of the 2008 summer olympic games - it still struggles with what face to put forward - one of a modern , open society or one that resembles more of the " old " china . bildunterschrift : critics accused china of using the olympic games as a pr event while at the same time suppressing criticism and dissent within china liao yiwu 's work is still unavailable in his homeland .
and though he is dismayed by his travel ban , he vows never to stop expressing his views .
" even if the authorities try to censor me , i will continue to work .
at least if people read my book , i 'll have made an impact , " he said .
although there has been much controversy surrounding the choice of china as a guest country for the frankfurt book fair , stemming from the past weeks ' events , matthias von hein believes this is a good step for both germany and china .
" i believe it is always good to challenge chinese partners with different concepts of press freedom , human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
and the more opportunities there are , the better it is . " vj / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .

" my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times .

merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .

but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . " the chancellor is increasing pensions , the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious german out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political science professor at berlin 's free university . the authenticity factor while merkel is a conservative , she does n't strike people as the fire-and-brimstone kind .

" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .

" she is perceived as an almost presidential figure , " said peter matuschek of the forsa polling group .
" she has always relied heavily on her performance on the international stage .
she has given a very statesman-like impression . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's backstory does n't quite match that of south africa 's nelson mandela - germans like her anyway her success might seem strange to those in countries where politicians need to be bigger than life to be elected , or should have the soaring rhetoric of barack obama to motivate , the hyperactive energy of france 's nicolas sarkozy to energize , or the inspiring back-story of someone like nelson mandela to inspire .
those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver hearing merkel speak at a party conference in the run-up to the sept .
27 election , there is no high-flying rhetoric or emotive outbursts to work up the crowd .
she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela kasner , later merkel , in 1973 merkel was born in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
when she was a baby , her father moved the family to east germany .
while it is thought that her family had a friendly enough relationship with the communist regime there , her father 's profession did raise suspicions .
merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to be always her best .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state .
michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " around her domestic agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with frank-walter steinmeier , current foreign minister and electoral opponent during the last four years , she was hobbled somewhat by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . " the chancellor is increasing pensions , the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious german out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political science professor at berlin 's free university . the authenticity factor while merkel is a conservative , she does n't strike people as the fire-and-brimstone kind .
that could be part of her appeal even to young people , according to thomas schneider of the junge union , the youth wing of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
in his opinion , merkel – with her pantsuits and somewhat plodding demeanor – is appreciated for who she is .
it 's a welcome change from glad-handing , million-dollar-smile politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not seen as an archconservative by many " i think that the young generation is expecting authentic people and i do n't think they are looking for someone in their mid-50s or 60s who is playing for them on a playstation " schneider said . he says inspiration also comes from her success in the middle of a party dominated by catholic men -lrb- two things she is not -rrb- , which not so long ago thought women should chair church committees , not g-8 conferences .
merkel , who entered politics only in 1990 , broke that mold . " it 's very impressive how someone can make such enormous progress in such a short time , " he said .
" it 's breathtaking . " author : kyle james editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .
" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .
" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

" she is perceived as an almost presidential figure , " said peter matuschek of the forsa polling group .
" she has always relied heavily on her performance on the international stage .
she has given a very statesman-like impression . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's backstory does n't quite match that of south africa 's nelson mandela - germans like her anyway her success might seem strange to those in countries where politicians need to be bigger than life to be elected , or should have the soaring rhetoric of barack obama to motivate , the hyperactive energy of france 's nicolas sarkozy to energize , or the inspiring back-story of someone like nelson mandela to inspire .
those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver hearing merkel speak at a party conference in the run-up to the sept .
27 election , there is no high-flying rhetoric or emotive outbursts to work up the crowd .
she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela kasner , later merkel , in 1973 merkel was born in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
when she was a baby , her father moved the family to east germany .
while it is thought that her family had a friendly enough relationship with the communist regime there , her father 's profession did raise suspicions .
merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to be always her best .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state .
michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " around her domestic agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with frank-walter steinmeier , current foreign minister and electoral opponent during the last four years , she was hobbled somewhat by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . " the chancellor is increasing pensions , the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious german out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political science professor at berlin 's free university . the authenticity factor while merkel is a conservative , she does n't strike people as the fire-and-brimstone kind .
that could be part of her appeal even to young people , according to thomas schneider of the junge union , the youth wing of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
in his opinion , merkel – with her pantsuits and somewhat plodding demeanor – is appreciated for who she is .
it 's a welcome change from glad-handing , million-dollar-smile politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not seen as an archconservative by many " i think that the young generation is expecting authentic people and i do n't think they are looking for someone in their mid-50s or 60s who is playing for them on a playstation " schneider said . he says inspiration also comes from her success in the middle of a party dominated by catholic men -lrb- two things she is not -rrb- , which not so long ago thought women should chair church committees , not g-8 conferences .
merkel , who entered politics only in 1990 , broke that mold . " it 's very impressive how someone can make such enormous progress in such a short time , " he said .
" it 's breathtaking . " author : kyle james editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when she was a baby , her father moved the family to east germany .
while it is thought that her family had a friendly enough relationship with the communist regime there , her father 's profession did raise suspicions .
merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .

" my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times .

i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state .
michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " around her domestic agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with frank-walter steinmeier , current foreign minister and electoral opponent during the last four years , she was hobbled somewhat by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . " the chancellor is increasing pensions , the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious german out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political science professor at berlin 's free university . the authenticity factor while merkel is a conservative , she does n't strike people as the fire-and-brimstone kind .
that could be part of her appeal even to young people , according to thomas schneider of the junge union , the youth wing of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
in his opinion , merkel – with her pantsuits and somewhat plodding demeanor – is appreciated for who she is .
it 's a welcome change from glad-handing , million-dollar-smile politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not seen as an archconservative by many " i think that the young generation is expecting authentic people and i do n't think they are looking for someone in their mid-50s or 60s who is playing for them on a playstation " schneider said . he says inspiration also comes from her success in the middle of a party dominated by catholic men -lrb- two things she is not -rrb- , which not so long ago thought women should chair church committees , not g-8 conferences .
merkel , who entered politics only in 1990 , broke that mold . " it 's very impressive how someone can make such enormous progress in such a short time , " he said .
" it 's breathtaking . " author : kyle james editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " if the collapse of the berlin wall marked a watershed in world history , it did all the more so for the countries of central and eastern europe , enabling them to take their rightful place as sovereign actors in the concert of nations , " the pontiff said . the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 . the visit by benedict is a sojourn to the most secular country in europe and comes shortly before the 20th anniversary of the velvet revolution , the peaceful coup which toppled the communist regime of former czechoslovakia . religious beliefs , and especially their display , were banned in communist czechoslovakia , which viewed the church , and religion as a whole , as an enemy of the people .
the regime kept priests under police surveillance and suppressed catholic publications and associations . bildunterschrift : the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 on the sidelines of the papal visit , vatican and czech representatives also discussed the sensitive issue of returning church property confiscated by the communists after world war ii .
a large number of churches , chapels , monasteries , agricultural land and artwork were nationalized by the czech regime at the time . pontiff confronts widely atheist public the pope , however , faces an uphill struggle to bring a religious revival to the country , despite the fall of communism . nearly 60 percent of czechs do not identify with any religion , according to a census taken in 2001 , up from 39 percent a decade earlier , putting the czech republic in stark contrast to neighboring and deeply devout poland .
the percentage of believers , on the other hand , dropped sharply between 1991 and 2001 from almost 44 percent to 32 percent , according to figures from the czech statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few czechs identify with religion but enough came to celebrate mass with the pope that has not deterred the pontiff , however , who said prior to his visit that " after going through the dramas of the past century , -lrb- the czech republic -rrb- needs , like the rest of the continent , to rediscover the reasons for faith and for hope . " church data indicates that there are also more people of faith than the government statistics show , according to jana michalkova , a spokeswoman for the diocese in litomerice , some 80 kilometers north of prague .
but , michalkova admits that half of the churches and chapels in her area were in very poor condition and some sunday masses " served just one or two people . " benedict not visiting former ethnic german region the pope 's agenda in the czech republic includes stopovers in prague , the southeastern city of brno and stara boleslav just outside prague . he will not be visiting the country 's western sudeten region , which was once mostly inhabited by ethnic germans , who were driven from their homes and fled to germany and austria after world war ii . the expulsion of the ethnic german catholics only accelerated the decline of religion in the post-war era and has been a frequent thorn in relations between the czech republic and germany . gb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the outcome of the two polls could n't be more different . both states had been governed by grand coalitions of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , but now it seems as if these alliances will fall apart .

initial voter turnout , however , was lower than in 2005 . despite bright sunshine in large parts of the country , fewer germans turned out to cast their ballots than at the last election , according to the electoral commissioner .
by 12 pm gmt , 36.1 percent of voters had cast their ballots , down from 41.9 percent at the same time in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initial voter turnout was sluggish in total , 62.2 million germans are entitled to vote for 28 parties seeking to enter the lower house of parliament , or bundestag . preliminary exit poll results are expected around 4 pm gmt .
security has been tightened throughout the country on election day in the wake of a series of warnings by islamic militants , including one from al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the messages call on germany to pull some 4,200 troops out of afghanistan . merkel the clear favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's lead has diminished in recent weeks chancellor angela merkel remains the clear favorite to win a second term in power .
but it 's unclear whether she will get the center-right government she says is needed to lift europe 's largest economy out of its worst slump in 60 years . merkel 's conservatives have been in an awkward " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for the past four years . merkel 's main rival in sunday 's vote is the leader of the spd and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier . the chancellor enjoys high popularity ratings , and opinion polls in recent weeks have given her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- a 8-11 point advantage over their center-left rivals .
the conservatives ' preferred coalition partner is the reform-minded business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . should the conservatives , however , fail to win enough support to team up with the fdp , merkel will probably be forced into the same uneasy right-left partnership she has presided over since 2005 . both candidates remain optimistic latest opinion polls show that a continuation of the " grand coalition " could be a likely outcome .
merkel 's lead has shrunk in recent weeks .
a poll by the forsa institute published two days before the vote showed her preferred coalition at 47 percent - not necessarily enough to clinch a clear majority under germany 's complex electoral system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to turn around his party 's fortunes but merkel remained upbeat on the eve of the election .
" i am always optimistic , " she told mass-circulation newspaper bild am sonntag . " voters will decide tomorrow how quickly we get out of this crisis , " merkel told a final rally on saturday .
" we are fighting for the german jobs of the future . " steinmeier , merkel 's rival for the top job , also sounded confident despite a risk that his party could score under the post-war low of 28.8 percent it received in 1953 . " i 've felt a great amount of support and a lot of interest in our cause .
and that 's why i 'm very , very confident about today , " steinmeier told reporters after he cast his vote in berlin on sunday . sp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

" " if the collapse of the berlin wall marked a watershed in world history , it did all the more so for the countries of central and eastern europe , enabling them to take their rightful place as sovereign actors in the concert of nations , " the pontiff said . the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 . the visit by benedict is a sojourn to the most secular country in europe and comes shortly before the 20th anniversary of the velvet revolution , the peaceful coup which toppled the communist regime of former czechoslovakia . religious beliefs , and especially their display , were banned in communist czechoslovakia , which viewed the church , and religion as a whole , as an enemy of the people .
the regime kept priests under police surveillance and suppressed catholic publications and associations . bildunterschrift : the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 on the sidelines of the papal visit , vatican and czech representatives also discussed the sensitive issue of returning church property confiscated by the communists after world war ii .
a large number of churches , chapels , monasteries , agricultural land and artwork were nationalized by the czech regime at the time . pontiff confronts widely atheist public the pope , however , faces an uphill struggle to bring a religious revival to the country , despite the fall of communism . nearly 60 percent of czechs do not identify with any religion , according to a census taken in 2001 , up from 39 percent a decade earlier , putting the czech republic in stark contrast to neighboring and deeply devout poland .
the percentage of believers , on the other hand , dropped sharply between 1991 and 2001 from almost 44 percent to 32 percent , according to figures from the czech statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few czechs identify with religion but enough came to celebrate mass with the pope that has not deterred the pontiff , however , who said prior to his visit that " after going through the dramas of the past century , -lrb- the czech republic -rrb- needs , like the rest of the continent , to rediscover the reasons for faith and for hope . " church data indicates that there are also more people of faith than the government statistics show , according to jana michalkova , a spokeswoman for the diocese in litomerice , some 80 kilometers north of prague .
but , michalkova admits that half of the churches and chapels in her area were in very poor condition and some sunday masses " served just one or two people . " benedict not visiting former ethnic german region the pope 's agenda in the czech republic includes stopovers in prague , the southeastern city of brno and stara boleslav just outside prague . he will not be visiting the country 's western sudeten region , which was once mostly inhabited by ethnic germans , who were driven from their homes and fled to germany and austria after world war ii . the expulsion of the ethnic german catholics only accelerated the decline of religion in the post-war era and has been a frequent thorn in relations between the czech republic and germany . gb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .

" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "

chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .
seeking a new alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " angie " is likely to win a second term in office , but she will need a coalition partner this time , merkel is hoping to garner enough votes to form an alliance with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "
a grand-coalition revival ?
the spd candidate frank-walter steinmeier has been gaining ground in the past few days .
and although there is every indication that merkel will win a second term in office , there has been increasing talk of another round of the grand-coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's supporters think that germany would be better off without " angie " in a speech to voters in dresden on saturday , steinmeier warned voters against electing a center-right government .
" those who do n't want this country to be torn apart into winners and losers must go and vote tomorrow , " he said .
" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .
in a letter published in the mass circulation bild am sonntag newspaper on election day , the german president horst koehler has appealed to the electorate not to be apathetic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters can come down as it 's up to the electorate now " non-voters are not represented in parliament , " koehler said .
" if you do n't vote , there is nobody in parliament to put forward your concerns , " he played on the collective conscience of the modern electorate , reminding voters that their right to have their say was not always a given .
" people died in the name of free , secret and equal voting rights , " he said .
" it is our democracy and we should n't weaken it . " tkw / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

initial voter turnout , however , was lower than in 2005 . despite bright sunshine in large parts of the country , fewer germans turned out to cast their ballots than at the last election , according to the electoral commissioner .
by 12 pm gmt , 36.1 percent of voters had cast their ballots , down from 41.9 percent at the same time in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initial voter turnout was sluggish in total , 62.2 million germans are entitled to vote for 28 parties seeking to enter the lower house of parliament , or bundestag . preliminary exit poll results are expected around 4 pm gmt .
security has been tightened throughout the country on election day in the wake of a series of warnings by islamic militants , including one from al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the messages call on germany to pull some 4,200 troops out of afghanistan . merkel the clear favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's lead has diminished in recent weeks chancellor angela merkel remains the clear favorite to win a second term in power .
but it 's unclear whether she will get the center-right government she says is needed to lift europe 's largest economy out of its worst slump in 60 years . merkel 's conservatives have been in an awkward " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for the past four years . merkel 's main rival in sunday 's vote is the leader of the spd and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier . the chancellor enjoys high popularity ratings , and opinion polls in recent weeks have given her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- a 8-11 point advantage over their center-left rivals .
the conservatives ' preferred coalition partner is the reform-minded business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . should the conservatives , however , fail to win enough support to team up with the fdp , merkel will probably be forced into the same uneasy right-left partnership she has presided over since 2005 . both candidates remain optimistic latest opinion polls show that a continuation of the " grand coalition " could be a likely outcome .
merkel 's lead has shrunk in recent weeks .
a poll by the forsa institute published two days before the vote showed her preferred coalition at 47 percent - not necessarily enough to clinch a clear majority under germany 's complex electoral system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to turn around his party 's fortunes but merkel remained upbeat on the eve of the election .
" i am always optimistic , " she told mass-circulation newspaper bild am sonntag . " voters will decide tomorrow how quickly we get out of this crisis , " merkel told a final rally on saturday .
" we are fighting for the german jobs of the future . " steinmeier , merkel 's rival for the top job , also sounded confident despite a risk that his party could score under the post-war low of 28.8 percent it received in 1953 . " i 've felt a great amount of support and a lot of interest in our cause .
and that 's why i 'm very , very confident about today , " steinmeier told reporters after he cast his vote in berlin on sunday . sp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2009 do german political parties have too much money ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political parties will likely spend over 60 million euros , much of it on advertising with german election campaigns becoming more expensive , political parties have adopted american-style tactics , such as asking for small donations online .
what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2009 do german political parties have too much money ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political parties will likely spend over 60 million euros , much of it on advertising with german election campaigns becoming more expensive , political parties have adopted american-style tactics , such as asking for small donations online .
what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

deutsche welle looks back at the last four years and the record of the grand coalition .
two big parties means little opposition elected in the autumn of 2005 to replace the spd-green coalition of then-chancellor gerhard schroeder , merkel and her deputy , steinmeier , set about turning former political foes into friends and tackling a long list of unfinished business .
at the time , merkel said the new cdu-spd coalition offered " an opportunity to overcome the economic crisis and advance reforms . "
since then , the grand coalition , facing only a small and ideologically divided opposition in parliament , has pushed through a wide range of legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is one of the few things merkel and steinmeier disagree on in the area of finance and economic reform , the grand coalition introduced the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , increasing the sales tax from 16 to 19 percent .
the government raised the pension age to 67 from 65 to offset the costs of an aging population .
it also extended the minimum wage to new sectors of the economy , but did not introduce a blanket minimum for everybody .
rising to the challenges of the economic crisis it successfully reined in budget deficits , only to see the savings evaporate in the face of the global economic crisis and is now sitting atop the biggest deficit germany has ever had .
to combat the economic meltdown the government passed two stimulus packages worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- .
it also set up a mammoth 500-billion-euro bank rescue plan to boost liquidity , and a 100-billion-euro " bad bank " plan to relieve banks of their toxic assets .
it introduced a much-copied " cash-for-clunkers " program to help the auto industry out of a serious sales slump .
the coalition also jumped to the rescue of german carmaker , opel , a subsidiary of us automaker , general motors .
the deal , according to the german weekly magazine , der spiegel , was so important to merkel that she told us president barack obama that it was " a test case for transatlantic relations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel meeting the dalai lama strained relations between berlin and beijing mixed reviews on foreign policy those relations would indeed be tested in the foreign policy sector .
the coalition first mended ties with the united states , which were sorely strained over the iraq war .
merkel then took a critical approach toward russia and china on human rights issues and caused outrage in beijing in 2007 by meeting the dalai lama .
however , the coalition has since been sharply criticized for its all-too chummy relationship with moscow , especially in the energy sector .
these ties prompted finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb to comment that germany has " weakened the unity of the european union . "
merkel and steinmeier have also been taken to task for their contradictory relationship to nato .
on the one hand , germany is participating in naval monitoring missions off the coast of lebanon and the horn of africa , but has been very reticent to get more involved in afghanistan , where it has about 4,200 troops in a mostly non-combat capacity .
coalition pushes climate agenda merkel did , however , earn considerable kudos for her six-month role as head of the eu presidency .
she got eu and g-8 members to tackle climate change and laid the groundwork for the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
back on the home front , the grand coalition introduced steps for germany to cut its co2 emissions by more than a third by 2020 and boosted efforts to promote renewable energy sources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.09.2009 germany goes to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler is one of 62 million germans eligble to vote with polling stations open , germans are voting in general elections .
chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .
seeking a new alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " angie " is likely to win a second term in office , but she will need a coalition partner this time , merkel is hoping to garner enough votes to form an alliance with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "
a grand-coalition revival ?
the spd candidate frank-walter steinmeier has been gaining ground in the past few days .
and although there is every indication that merkel will win a second term in office , there has been increasing talk of another round of the grand-coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's supporters think that germany would be better off without " angie " in a speech to voters in dresden on saturday , steinmeier warned voters against electing a center-right government .
" those who do n't want this country to be torn apart into winners and losers must go and vote tomorrow , " he said .
" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .
in a letter published in the mass circulation bild am sonntag newspaper on election day , the german president horst koehler has appealed to the electorate not to be apathetic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters can come down as it 's up to the electorate now " non-voters are not represented in parliament , " koehler said .
" if you do n't vote , there is nobody in parliament to put forward your concerns , " he played on the collective conscience of the modern electorate , reminding voters that their right to have their say was not always a given .
" people died in the name of free , secret and equal voting rights , " he said .
" it is our democracy and we should n't weaken it . " tkw / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .
" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .

a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .
" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .
" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

" she is perceived as an almost presidential figure , " said peter matuschek of the forsa polling group .
" she has always relied heavily on her performance on the international stage .
she has given a very statesman-like impression . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's backstory does n't quite match that of south africa 's nelson mandela - germans like her anyway her success might seem strange to those in countries where politicians need to be bigger than life to be elected , or should have the soaring rhetoric of barack obama to motivate , the hyperactive energy of france 's nicolas sarkozy to energize , or the inspiring back-story of someone like nelson mandela to inspire .
those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver hearing merkel speak at a party conference in the run-up to the sept .
27 election , there is no high-flying rhetoric or emotive outbursts to work up the crowd .
she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela kasner , later merkel , in 1973 merkel was born in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
when she was a baby , her father moved the family to east germany .
while it is thought that her family had a friendly enough relationship with the communist regime there , her father 's profession did raise suspicions .
merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to be always her best .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state .
michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " around her domestic agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with frank-walter steinmeier , current foreign minister and electoral opponent during the last four years , she was hobbled somewhat by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . " the chancellor is increasing pensions , the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious german out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political science professor at berlin 's free university . the authenticity factor while merkel is a conservative , she does n't strike people as the fire-and-brimstone kind .
that could be part of her appeal even to young people , according to thomas schneider of the junge union , the youth wing of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
in his opinion , merkel – with her pantsuits and somewhat plodding demeanor – is appreciated for who she is .
it 's a welcome change from glad-handing , million-dollar-smile politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not seen as an archconservative by many " i think that the young generation is expecting authentic people and i do n't think they are looking for someone in their mid-50s or 60s who is playing for them on a playstation " schneider said . he says inspiration also comes from her success in the middle of a party dominated by catholic men -lrb- two things she is not -rrb- , which not so long ago thought women should chair church committees , not g-8 conferences .
merkel , who entered politics only in 1990 , broke that mold . " it 's very impressive how someone can make such enormous progress in such a short time , " he said .
" it 's breathtaking . " author : kyle james editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when she was a baby , her father moved the family to east germany .
while it is thought that her family had a friendly enough relationship with the communist regime there , her father 's profession did raise suspicions .
merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to be always her best .

but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . " the chancellor is increasing pensions , the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious german out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political science professor at berlin 's free university . the authenticity factor while merkel is a conservative , she does n't strike people as the fire-and-brimstone kind .
that could be part of her appeal even to young people , according to thomas schneider of the junge union , the youth wing of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .
" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .

but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times .

that could be part of her appeal even to young people , according to thomas schneider of the junge union , the youth wing of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
in his opinion , merkel – with her pantsuits and somewhat plodding demeanor – is appreciated for who she is .
it 's a welcome change from glad-handing , million-dollar-smile politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not seen as an archconservative by many " i think that the young generation is expecting authentic people and i do n't think they are looking for someone in their mid-50s or 60s who is playing for them on a playstation " schneider said . he says inspiration also comes from her success in the middle of a party dominated by catholic men -lrb- two things she is not -rrb- , which not so long ago thought women should chair church committees , not g-8 conferences .

" my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times .

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .
" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .
" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

" " if the collapse of the berlin wall marked a watershed in world history , it did all the more so for the countries of central and eastern europe , enabling them to take their rightful place as sovereign actors in the concert of nations , " the pontiff said . the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 . the visit by benedict is a sojourn to the most secular country in europe and comes shortly before the 20th anniversary of the velvet revolution , the peaceful coup which toppled the communist regime of former czechoslovakia . religious beliefs , and especially their display , were banned in communist czechoslovakia , which viewed the church , and religion as a whole , as an enemy of the people .

" " if the collapse of the berlin wall marked a watershed in world history , it did all the more so for the countries of central and eastern europe , enabling them to take their rightful place as sovereign actors in the concert of nations , " the pontiff said . the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 . the visit by benedict is a sojourn to the most secular country in europe and comes shortly before the 20th anniversary of the velvet revolution , the peaceful coup which toppled the communist regime of former czechoslovakia . religious beliefs , and especially their display , were banned in communist czechoslovakia , which viewed the church , and religion as a whole , as an enemy of the people .
the regime kept priests under police surveillance and suppressed catholic publications and associations . bildunterschrift : the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 on the sidelines of the papal visit , vatican and czech representatives also discussed the sensitive issue of returning church property confiscated by the communists after world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2009 opinion : new government faces tough task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a new government with the pro-business fdp .
dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

german and chinese organizers have clashed over attendees . " massacre " is the name of the poem written by liao yiwu that sent him to prison for four years .
in it , he condemned the 1989 killings in tiananmen square .
in his book " the corpse walker " - that 's just been published in german - he tells the stories of people from the bottom-rung of chinese society - from a village teacher to a blind street musician - left behind in the country 's economic boom .
the fifty-year-old chinese musician , reporter , and author , was supposed to travel to berlin next month to participate in a panel discussion at the berlin house of world cultures .
but , he says , chinese authorities have banned him from traveling .
" chinese state security officials told me that i will not be allowed to fly to germany , " liao was quoted in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

controversy surrounding frankfurt book fair the event at the berlin house of world cultures is one of several connected with the frankfurt book fair , which takes place from october 14-18 .
china has been invited to be this year 's guest nation , but organizers in germany are finding it difficult to work with a country that limits press freedom .
two weeks ago , two chinese dissident writers had their invitations to the frankfurt book fair revoked by german organizers , after china 's organizing committee complained .
the move angered many in germany who felt china was taking charge of the event .
however , china expert matthias von hein says china does not have as much control as critics think .
" china is in a strange position at this book fair because it has been willing to present itself there , knowing that the frankfurt book fair is an event that can not be totally controlled by the propaganda department , " he said .
he added that there are many chinese writers in attendance at these events who have drawn the ire of chinese officials .
press freedom in the " new " china while china 's economic boom has made it a more formidable presence on the world stage - as was demonstrated by its hosting of the 2008 summer olympic games - it still struggles with what face to put forward - one of a modern , open society or one that resembles more of the " old " china . bildunterschrift : critics accused china of using the olympic games as a pr event while at the same time suppressing criticism and dissent within china liao yiwu 's work is still unavailable in his homeland .
and though he is dismayed by his travel ban , he vows never to stop expressing his views .
" even if the authorities try to censor me , i will continue to work .
at least if people read my book , i 'll have made an impact , " he said .

german and chinese organizers have clashed over attendees . " massacre " is the name of the poem written by liao yiwu that sent him to prison for four years .
in it , he condemned the 1989 killings in tiananmen square .
in his book " the corpse walker " - that 's just been published in german - he tells the stories of people from the bottom-rung of chinese society - from a village teacher to a blind street musician - left behind in the country 's economic boom .
the fifty-year-old chinese musician , reporter , and author , was supposed to travel to berlin next month to participate in a panel discussion at the berlin house of world cultures .
but , he says , chinese authorities have banned him from traveling .
" chinese state security officials told me that i will not be allowed to fly to germany , " liao was quoted in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

controversy surrounding frankfurt book fair the event at the berlin house of world cultures is one of several connected with the frankfurt book fair , which takes place from october 14-18 .
china has been invited to be this year 's guest nation , but organizers in germany are finding it difficult to work with a country that limits press freedom .
two weeks ago , two chinese dissident writers had their invitations to the frankfurt book fair revoked by german organizers , after china 's organizing committee complained .
the move angered many in germany who felt china was taking charge of the event .
however , china expert matthias von hein says china does not have as much control as critics think .
" china is in a strange position at this book fair because it has been willing to present itself there , knowing that the frankfurt book fair is an event that can not be totally controlled by the propaganda department , " he said .
he added that there are many chinese writers in attendance at these events who have drawn the ire of chinese officials .

and though he is dismayed by his travel ban , he vows never to stop expressing his views .
" even if the authorities try to censor me , i will continue to work .
at least if people read my book , i 'll have made an impact , " he said .

but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .

initial voter turnout , however , was lower than in 2005 . despite bright sunshine in large parts of the country , fewer germans turned out to cast their ballots than at the last election , according to the electoral commissioner .
by 12 pm gmt , 36.1 percent of voters had cast their ballots , down from 41.9 percent at the same time in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initial voter turnout was sluggish in total , 62.2 million germans are entitled to vote for 28 parties seeking to enter the lower house of parliament , or bundestag . preliminary exit poll results are expected around 4 pm gmt .

the conservatives ' preferred coalition partner is the reform-minded business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . should the conservatives , however , fail to win enough support to team up with the fdp , merkel will probably be forced into the same uneasy right-left partnership she has presided over since 2005 . both candidates remain optimistic latest opinion polls show that a continuation of the " grand coalition " could be a likely outcome .
merkel 's lead has shrunk in recent weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.09.2009 germany goes to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler is one of 62 million germans eligble to vote with polling stations open , germans are voting in general elections .
chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .
seeking a new alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " angie " is likely to win a second term in office , but she will need a coalition partner this time , merkel is hoping to garner enough votes to form an alliance with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "
a grand-coalition revival ?
the spd candidate frank-walter steinmeier has been gaining ground in the past few days .
and although there is every indication that merkel will win a second term in office , there has been increasing talk of another round of the grand-coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's supporters think that germany would be better off without " angie " in a speech to voters in dresden on saturday , steinmeier warned voters against electing a center-right government .
" those who do n't want this country to be torn apart into winners and losers must go and vote tomorrow , " he said .
" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .
in a letter published in the mass circulation bild am sonntag newspaper on election day , the german president horst koehler has appealed to the electorate not to be apathetic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters can come down as it 's up to the electorate now " non-voters are not represented in parliament , " koehler said .
" if you do n't vote , there is nobody in parliament to put forward your concerns , " he played on the collective conscience of the modern electorate , reminding voters that their right to have their say was not always a given .
" people died in the name of free , secret and equal voting rights , " he said .
" it is our democracy and we should n't weaken it . " tkw / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2009 opinion : new government faces tough task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a new government with the pro-business fdp .
dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.09.2009 germany goes to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler is one of 62 million germans eligble to vote with polling stations open , germans are voting in general elections .
chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .
seeking a new alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " angie " is likely to win a second term in office , but she will need a coalition partner this time , merkel is hoping to garner enough votes to form an alliance with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "
a grand-coalition revival ?
the spd candidate frank-walter steinmeier has been gaining ground in the past few days .
and although there is every indication that merkel will win a second term in office , there has been increasing talk of another round of the grand-coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's supporters think that germany would be better off without " angie " in a speech to voters in dresden on saturday , steinmeier warned voters against electing a center-right government .
" those who do n't want this country to be torn apart into winners and losers must go and vote tomorrow , " he said .
" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .
in a letter published in the mass circulation bild am sonntag newspaper on election day , the german president horst koehler has appealed to the electorate not to be apathetic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters can come down as it 's up to the electorate now " non-voters are not represented in parliament , " koehler said .
" if you do n't vote , there is nobody in parliament to put forward your concerns , " he played on the collective conscience of the modern electorate , reminding voters that their right to have their say was not always a given .
" people died in the name of free , secret and equal voting rights , " he said .
" it is our democracy and we should n't weaken it . " tkw / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

initial voter turnout , however , was lower than in 2005 . despite bright sunshine in large parts of the country , fewer germans turned out to cast their ballots than at the last election , according to the electoral commissioner .
by 12 pm gmt , 36.1 percent of voters had cast their ballots , down from 41.9 percent at the same time in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initial voter turnout was sluggish in total , 62.2 million germans are entitled to vote for 28 parties seeking to enter the lower house of parliament , or bundestag . preliminary exit poll results are expected around 4 pm gmt .

the conservatives ' preferred coalition partner is the reform-minded business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . should the conservatives , however , fail to win enough support to team up with the fdp , merkel will probably be forced into the same uneasy right-left partnership she has presided over since 2005 . both candidates remain optimistic latest opinion polls show that a continuation of the " grand coalition " could be a likely outcome .
merkel 's lead has shrunk in recent weeks .
a poll by the forsa institute published two days before the vote showed her preferred coalition at 47 percent - not necessarily enough to clinch a clear majority under germany 's complex electoral system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to turn around his party 's fortunes but merkel remained upbeat on the eve of the election .

the conservatives ' preferred coalition partner is the reform-minded business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . should the conservatives , however , fail to win enough support to team up with the fdp , merkel will probably be forced into the same uneasy right-left partnership she has presided over since 2005 . both candidates remain optimistic latest opinion polls show that a continuation of the " grand coalition " could be a likely outcome .
merkel 's lead has shrunk in recent weeks .
a poll by the forsa institute published two days before the vote showed her preferred coalition at 47 percent - not necessarily enough to clinch a clear majority under germany 's complex electoral system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to turn around his party 's fortunes but merkel remained upbeat on the eve of the election .

chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .

that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "

" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2009 opinion : new government faces tough task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a new government with the pro-business fdp .
dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

german and chinese organizers have clashed over attendees . " massacre " is the name of the poem written by liao yiwu that sent him to prison for four years .
in it , he condemned the 1989 killings in tiananmen square .
in his book " the corpse walker " - that 's just been published in german - he tells the stories of people from the bottom-rung of chinese society - from a village teacher to a blind street musician - left behind in the country 's economic boom .
the fifty-year-old chinese musician , reporter , and author , was supposed to travel to berlin next month to participate in a panel discussion at the berlin house of world cultures .
but , he says , chinese authorities have banned him from traveling .
" chinese state security officials told me that i will not be allowed to fly to germany , " liao was quoted in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's books are available in germany - not in china " for people in the west , it 's the most normal thing in the world to be able to write freely .
in china , we have to fight for this , " he told deutsche welle .
controversy surrounding frankfurt book fair the event at the berlin house of world cultures is one of several connected with the frankfurt book fair , which takes place from october 14-18 .
china has been invited to be this year 's guest nation , but organizers in germany are finding it difficult to work with a country that limits press freedom .
two weeks ago , two chinese dissident writers had their invitations to the frankfurt book fair revoked by german organizers , after china 's organizing committee complained .
the move angered many in germany who felt china was taking charge of the event .
however , china expert matthias von hein says china does not have as much control as critics think .
" china is in a strange position at this book fair because it has been willing to present itself there , knowing that the frankfurt book fair is an event that can not be totally controlled by the propaganda department , " he said .
he added that there are many chinese writers in attendance at these events who have drawn the ire of chinese officials .
press freedom in the " new " china while china 's economic boom has made it a more formidable presence on the world stage - as was demonstrated by its hosting of the 2008 summer olympic games - it still struggles with what face to put forward - one of a modern , open society or one that resembles more of the " old " china . bildunterschrift : critics accused china of using the olympic games as a pr event while at the same time suppressing criticism and dissent within china liao yiwu 's work is still unavailable in his homeland .
and though he is dismayed by his travel ban , he vows never to stop expressing his views .
" even if the authorities try to censor me , i will continue to work .
at least if people read my book , i 'll have made an impact , " he said .
although there has been much controversy surrounding the choice of china as a guest country for the frankfurt book fair , stemming from the past weeks ' events , matthias von hein believes this is a good step for both germany and china .
" i believe it is always good to challenge chinese partners with different concepts of press freedom , human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
and the more opportunities there are , the better it is . " vj / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.09.2009 germany goes to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president koehler is one of 62 million germans eligble to vote with polling stations open , germans are voting in general elections .
chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .
seeking a new alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " angie " is likely to win a second term in office , but she will need a coalition partner this time , merkel is hoping to garner enough votes to form an alliance with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "
a grand-coalition revival ?
the spd candidate frank-walter steinmeier has been gaining ground in the past few days .
and although there is every indication that merkel will win a second term in office , there has been increasing talk of another round of the grand-coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's supporters think that germany would be better off without " angie " in a speech to voters in dresden on saturday , steinmeier warned voters against electing a center-right government .
" those who do n't want this country to be torn apart into winners and losers must go and vote tomorrow , " he said .
" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2009 opinion : new government faces tough task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a new government with the pro-business fdp .
dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2009 opinion : new government faces tough task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a new government with the pro-business fdp .
dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2009 opinion : new government faces tough task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a new government with the pro-business fdp .
dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .

rising to the challenges of the economic crisis it successfully reined in budget deficits , only to see the savings evaporate in the face of the global economic crisis and is now sitting atop the biggest deficit germany has ever had .
to combat the economic meltdown the government passed two stimulus packages worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- .

merkel then took a critical approach toward russia and china on human rights issues and caused outrage in beijing in 2007 by meeting the dalai lama .
however , the coalition has since been sharply criticized for its all-too chummy relationship with moscow , especially in the energy sector .

on the one hand , germany is participating in naval monitoring missions off the coast of lebanon and the horn of africa , but has been very reticent to get more involved in afghanistan , where it has about 4,200 troops in a mostly non-combat capacity .
coalition pushes climate agenda merkel did , however , earn considerable kudos for her six-month role as head of the eu presidency .
she got eu and g-8 members to tackle climate change and laid the groundwork for the eu 's lisbon reform treaty .
back on the home front , the grand coalition introduced steps for germany to cut its co2 emissions by more than a third by 2020 and boosted efforts to promote renewable energy sources .
but , the cdu and spd remain starkly divided over the issue of nuclear energy and whether or not to keep or extend a planned phase-out by 2030. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what role does fundraising play in german politics ? eckhart von klaeden appears distinctly uncomfortable in a video posted online .
wearing a jacket , but no tie , he appeals directly to the camera : “ five , ten , 15 or 20 euros are an important contribution to the stability of our country and electoral success of the cdu . ”
a few minutes later he cheerfully adds : “ you can even pay by credit card ! ”
the aristocratic von klaeden serves as treasurer of the christian democratic union and is the cdu 's fundraiser in this year 's election .
though there 's little the cdu or chancellor angela merkel 's re-election campaign have in common with barack obama or the democratic party of the united states , it 's clear that someone in the cdu took close notes last fall .
it 's impossible to imagine german voters donating anywhere near the one billion dollars that us presidential candidates raised last year .
but money in politics is a popular theme in germany , too .
german media reports say the parties could spend over 60 million euros in this year 's election cycle and some parties have suggested that the cdu and their preferred coalition partner the free democrats are tainted by their financial ties to business .
pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

german and chinese organizers have clashed over attendees . " massacre " is the name of the poem written by liao yiwu that sent him to prison for four years .
in it , he condemned the 1989 killings in tiananmen square .
in his book " the corpse walker " - that 's just been published in german - he tells the stories of people from the bottom-rung of chinese society - from a village teacher to a blind street musician - left behind in the country 's economic boom .
the fifty-year-old chinese musician , reporter , and author , was supposed to travel to berlin next month to participate in a panel discussion at the berlin house of world cultures .
but , he says , chinese authorities have banned him from traveling .
" chinese state security officials told me that i will not be allowed to fly to germany , " liao was quoted in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's books are available in germany - not in china " for people in the west , it 's the most normal thing in the world to be able to write freely .
in china , we have to fight for this , " he told deutsche welle .
controversy surrounding frankfurt book fair the event at the berlin house of world cultures is one of several connected with the frankfurt book fair , which takes place from october 14-18 .
china has been invited to be this year 's guest nation , but organizers in germany are finding it difficult to work with a country that limits press freedom .
two weeks ago , two chinese dissident writers had their invitations to the frankfurt book fair revoked by german organizers , after china 's organizing committee complained .
the move angered many in germany who felt china was taking charge of the event .
however , china expert matthias von hein says china does not have as much control as critics think .
" china is in a strange position at this book fair because it has been willing to present itself there , knowing that the frankfurt book fair is an event that can not be totally controlled by the propaganda department , " he said .
he added that there are many chinese writers in attendance at these events who have drawn the ire of chinese officials .
press freedom in the " new " china while china 's economic boom has made it a more formidable presence on the world stage - as was demonstrated by its hosting of the 2008 summer olympic games - it still struggles with what face to put forward - one of a modern , open society or one that resembles more of the " old " china . bildunterschrift : critics accused china of using the olympic games as a pr event while at the same time suppressing criticism and dissent within china liao yiwu 's work is still unavailable in his homeland .
and though he is dismayed by his travel ban , he vows never to stop expressing his views .
" even if the authorities try to censor me , i will continue to work .
at least if people read my book , i 'll have made an impact , " he said .
although there has been much controversy surrounding the choice of china as a guest country for the frankfurt book fair , stemming from the past weeks ' events , matthias von hein believes this is a good step for both germany and china .
" i believe it is always good to challenge chinese partners with different concepts of press freedom , human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
and the more opportunities there are , the better it is . " vj / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pulp fiction meets campaign finance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties are trying to mobilize voters and donors through sophisticated web sites the cdu 's attempt to apply the obama approach and woo small donors is particularly striking because the party 's opponents are trying hard to paint the conservatives as little more than an appendage of big business .
a recent commercial by the green party was vaguely reminiscent of a scene from the quentin tarantino film " pulp fiction " .
with classic soul music as a soundtrack , a thuggish-looking character lectures an angela merkel look-alike .
“ alright lady , promise the people tax cuts , that will draw them in , ” he oozes .
“ when you win , shove our plan into effect .
more money for the banks , no brakes on the stock market , more nuclear energy ... ”
in the end , a meek merkel squeaks out a weak “ yes . ”
it 's not subtle but neither was merkel 's rival from the social democrats , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who , in their only televised debate , all but told merkel to her face that her party were corporate shills .
“ when i look at donations to the political parties , if i remember correctly , the fdp -lsb- free democratic party -rsb- and the cdu have three million -lsb- euros -rsb- in donations from banks and corporations while the spd got 200,000 -lsb- euros -rsb- , ” steinmeier said .
the accusation is clear that money and politics are old bedfellows .
but in making that charge , steinmeier was merely playing to the crowd while ignoring germany 's party financing system , which he knows well from his many years as a leading functionary in the spd .
“ the cdu receives about five percent of its income from business donations , ” laughed political scientist michael koss .
“ it 's just not that important . ”
how the party financing system works koss , a researcher at potsdam university , wrote his doctoral dissertation on the german party financing system .
he told deutsche welle that unlike in the united states and some other countries , germany makes no distinction between funds for a political party and campaign funds .
they belong to the same pot of money and are part of a system that resembles a three-legged stool , reliant upon direct government support , corporate and individual donations and party membership dues .
each year the state sets aside a pool of money for use by the political parties , currently 133 million euros .
much of that money is divided up according to how many votes the parties receive once they pass a rather low threshold - just 0.5 percent at the national level and one percent at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong showing could make the upstart pirate party eligible for state funds the newly-founded pirate party , which advocates increased online privacy and fewer copyright and patent restrictions , is hoping to achieve over 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for state financing .
individual donations to political parties - up to 3,300 euros - are tax-deductible , another state subsidy designed to encourage political involvement .
on top of that , such donations are also matched at a rate of 38 cents per euro by the government .
there is , however , no limit to how big corporate donations can be .
the main requirement is that donations be reported to the bundestag , which administers the party finance system , and disclosed on the parliament 's web site .
marketers and extremists flourish , critics say it 's a generous system and one that none of the parties seem eager to change .
but there are critics who say that german political parties live high on government largess .
“ when i see the parties stick large amounts of these millions into campaigns where they produce classic merchandising items like soccer balls , balloons and whistles , then i think that money is being improperly used , ” taxpayers federation head rainer holznagel told deutsche welle .
holznagel said his watchdog organization supports the public financing of political parties , but hoped to see less tax money spent on frivolous “ marketing ” gimmicks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme right-wing npd received 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 a more serious charge leveled against germany 's party funding system is that it inadvertently supports right-wing extremism , particularly the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
as a legal political party , albeit one under close government surveillance for its many hostile outbursts towards foreigners , that draws single digit support in several german states , the npd received nearly 1.45 million euros in state funding in 2007 .
politicians from the rest of the political spectrum have tried for years to cut off the npd 's access to state funds , though researcher michael koss thinks the attempts do more harm to the democratic parties than to the npd .
“ compared to the more established parties , the npd receives a negligible amount of money , ” koss told deutsche welle .
“ of course , it 's painful for a democracy to fund its opponents , but germany is a democracy and in a democracy the system has to be the same for every party . ”
arguably , the funding system has become a useful tool for weakening the npd .
a bookkeeping scandal has cost the party over a million euros in fines and 300,000 euros in withheld funds .
the value of transparency the party financing system 's rigorous disclosure requirements have trapped more than just the npd .
a funding scandal in the late 1990s helped end former chancellor helmut kohl 's term and the resulting legal tsunami eviscerated much of the party 's senior leadership at the time , paving the way for angela merkel 's ascent .
“ it 's really a system that works well , because all of these scandals prove that the system was working because the scandals were detected , ” said koss .
although the system has kept german politics relatively free of corruption , koss said the ability to attract donations of unlimited size can give the appearance of impropriety .
“ most donations are n't that big , so i 'd like to see a system where there 's a high cap , say 50,000 euros , so that big donors can give money , but that does n't feel like companies are buying political parties , ” koss said .

initial voter turnout , however , was lower than in 2005 . despite bright sunshine in large parts of the country , fewer germans turned out to cast their ballots than at the last election , according to the electoral commissioner .
by 12 pm gmt , 36.1 percent of voters had cast their ballots , down from 41.9 percent at the same time in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initial voter turnout was sluggish in total , 62.2 million germans are entitled to vote for 28 parties seeking to enter the lower house of parliament , or bundestag . preliminary exit poll results are expected around 4 pm gmt .
security has been tightened throughout the country on election day in the wake of a series of warnings by islamic militants , including one from al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the messages call on germany to pull some 4,200 troops out of afghanistan . merkel the clear favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's lead has diminished in recent weeks chancellor angela merkel remains the clear favorite to win a second term in power .
but it 's unclear whether she will get the center-right government she says is needed to lift europe 's largest economy out of its worst slump in 60 years . merkel 's conservatives have been in an awkward " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for the past four years . merkel 's main rival in sunday 's vote is the leader of the spd and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier . the chancellor enjoys high popularity ratings , and opinion polls in recent weeks have given her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- a 8-11 point advantage over their center-left rivals .
the conservatives ' preferred coalition partner is the reform-minded business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . should the conservatives , however , fail to win enough support to team up with the fdp , merkel will probably be forced into the same uneasy right-left partnership she has presided over since 2005 . both candidates remain optimistic latest opinion polls show that a continuation of the " grand coalition " could be a likely outcome .
merkel 's lead has shrunk in recent weeks .
a poll by the forsa institute published two days before the vote showed her preferred coalition at 47 percent - not necessarily enough to clinch a clear majority under germany 's complex electoral system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to turn around his party 's fortunes but merkel remained upbeat on the eve of the election .
" i am always optimistic , " she told mass-circulation newspaper bild am sonntag . " voters will decide tomorrow how quickly we get out of this crisis , " merkel told a final rally on saturday .
" we are fighting for the german jobs of the future . " steinmeier , merkel 's rival for the top job , also sounded confident despite a risk that his party could score under the post-war low of 28.8 percent it received in 1953 . " i 've felt a great amount of support and a lot of interest in our cause .
and that 's why i 'm very , very confident about today , " steinmeier told reporters after he cast his vote in berlin on sunday . sp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel and her challenger frank-walter steinmeier wrapped up their campaigns with a last effort to win over undecided voters . some candidates , like mr. steinmeier , have already cast their ballots in sunny weather , which analysts say should have a positive effect on the overall turnout .
but with 62 million eligible voters and their potential for surprises , merkel told a rally of some one thousand people on saturday in berlin that " we are going to fight to the end because every vote counts , " " we are the only party in germany to govern the economy sensibly , " she said , adding that it was ultimately up to voters to decide how quickly they wanted to emerge from the crisis .
the chancellor 's last-minute plea followed the latest opinion polls which showed her party had conceded some ground to their rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom they have shared a loveless coalition since the last federal election in 2005 .
voters have until 6 p.m. to cast their ballots and shortly thereafter the first returns will be available .
seeking a new alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " angie " is likely to win a second term in office , but she will need a coalition partner this time , merkel is hoping to garner enough votes to form an alliance with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
" we can only have stability with a coalition between a strong unon and the fdp , " she said .
but the prospect of that power-sharing agreement , which enjoyed a good rating in the polls last month , has grown steadily less popular with the electorate in the run-up to the election .
that , however , did not prevent liberal leader guido westerwelle from using his closing rally in the city of cologne on saturday to optimistically declare that these were the " final hours in opposition " for his party .
he said the end to the grand coalition would bring with it the end of an era of " higher taxes and more bureaucracy . "
a grand-coalition revival ?
the spd candidate frank-walter steinmeier has been gaining ground in the past few days .
and although there is every indication that merkel will win a second term in office , there has been increasing talk of another round of the grand-coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's supporters think that germany would be better off without " angie " in a speech to voters in dresden on saturday , steinmeier warned voters against electing a center-right government .
" those who do n't want this country to be torn apart into winners and losers must go and vote tomorrow , " he said .
" those who want to prevent a center-right coalition must get up off the sofa and go to the polling station and vote spd . "
presidential call for high voter turnout there has been speculation among election analysts that voter turnout tomorrow could be even lower than in 2005 when 77.7 percent of those eligible cast a ballot .
in a letter published in the mass circulation bild am sonntag newspaper on election day , the german president horst koehler has appealed to the electorate not to be apathetic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters can come down as it 's up to the electorate now " non-voters are not represented in parliament , " koehler said .
" if you do n't vote , there is nobody in parliament to put forward your concerns , " he played on the collective conscience of the modern electorate , reminding voters that their right to have their say was not always a given .
" people died in the name of free , secret and equal voting rights , " he said .
" it is our democracy and we should n't weaken it . " tkw / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fdp is set to govern with chancellor merkel 's conservatives in a center-right government . westerwelle was elected head of the liberal , pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- at a time when the fdp admittedly needed to open its doors to a new breed of voter and appeal to more than just business-focused professionals to stay alive .
at 47 , he was the party 's youngest ever leader and first ever chancellor candidate .
but success was not immediately forthcoming .
under their new and relatively youthful leader , and armed with a fresh campaign tactic which embraced the " fun " side of politics , the liberals set an ambitious target of 18 percent for the 2002 federal elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guidomobile was considered a political stunt gone wrong initially , westerwelle 's approach intrigued .
his campaign schedule , which peaked with an appearance on germany 's " big brother " television show , was modern , fresh and even provocative at times .
westerwelle , who became known as the spasspolitiker - the fun and games politician - even went so far as to turn up on a tv program with a giant yellow 18 on the soles of his shoes .
he followed that up by driving to the mannheim congress center for a party conference in a bright yellow bus nicknamed the " guidomobile . "
the tactic was designed to win over a public that was supposedly bored with the traditional two-horse race between the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
but the campaign of " fun " failed to capture germans ' imagination , and the fdp finished with only 7.4 percent of the popular vote , less than half their original target .
many felt that the hype westerwelle had created trivialized politics and covered up an election platform that was lacking in substance .
westerwelle guided the fdp to an improved result of around 9.9 percent in 2005 elections , a fairer reflection of the party 's popularity .
but it was n't enough to get the party into government with the cdu , which needed to pair up with the spd to form a parliamentary majority .
new tack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have responded positively to westerwelle 's more serious approach westerwelle has shed his former complexion as the fun and games politician , adopting a more austere , fdp-means-business approach to the 2009 campaign .
" he is now a little bit more modest and conservative in his appearance , " werner weidenfeld , a political scientist at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
" the people want to have a serious partner in government , not just a humorous clown jumping around making a lot of jokes . "
westerwelle 's new persona chimes better with german voters ' expectations , weidenfeld says , and it 's a decisive factor in the fdp 's success in polls .
earlier in the year , the party was actually polling at around 18 percent , feeding off the backs of the spd and cdu , which were shedding supporters like they were going out of fashion .
those figures have come back down to a more realistic 14 percent in recent months , but if the trend continues , the free democrats and guido westerwelle could be heading into government as junior coalition partners to the cdu , which is expected to come out on top in the election .
it would be the first time the fdp has been in government since 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last time the fdp was in government helmut kohl was chancellor westerwelle is tipped as first in line for the post of foreign minister in a cdu-fdp coalition , though he has sought to quash any speculation about his post-election future should a the two parties prevail .
he has said that foremost in voters ' minds was what a cdu-fdp government could achieve , not who was awarded which portfolio .
his greatest task in government , analysts say , will not be the upkeep of his portfolio , whatever that may be , but perhaps positioning himself to exert pressure on the much larger cdu to demand the tax system changes he and his party have been campaigning on since the election season began .
mistrust inside the camp but westerwelle has many critics , including members of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to the cdu , with whom the fdp would also govern .
recently csu leader horst seehofer said he did not trust the fdp leader , fearing the liberals might opt for a coalition with the social democrats and greens over a partnership with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts say westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and green leader claudia roth are irreconcilable but former spd parliamentarian and political scientist nils diederich told deutsche welle that an fdp-spd-green coalition would not bring harmony to german politics , and that westerwelle knows this .
" there is no possibility of compromising between the greens and the liberals , " he says .
" guido westerwelle wants and strives towards a coalition with the christian democrats . "
a coalition between the social democrats and the fdp is out of the question , he says , adding that " westerwelle has stated very firmly that he wants a new majority of the right-wing between christian democrats and the liberals .
i think that this is not only a tactical but principled decision . "
with opinion polls showing that many germans have lost interest in the much larger spd and cdu parties , guido westerwelle could be on the verge of resurrecting the fdp and avoiding another cold , four-year stint as default opposition leader .

" she is perceived as an almost presidential figure , " said peter matuschek of the forsa polling group .
" she has always relied heavily on her performance on the international stage .
she has given a very statesman-like impression . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's backstory does n't quite match that of south africa 's nelson mandela - germans like her anyway her success might seem strange to those in countries where politicians need to be bigger than life to be elected , or should have the soaring rhetoric of barack obama to motivate , the hyperactive energy of france 's nicolas sarkozy to energize , or the inspiring back-story of someone like nelson mandela to inspire .
those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver hearing merkel speak at a party conference in the run-up to the sept .
27 election , there is no high-flying rhetoric or emotive outbursts to work up the crowd .
she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela kasner , later merkel , in 1973 merkel was born in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
when she was a baby , her father moved the family to east germany .
while it is thought that her family had a friendly enough relationship with the communist regime there , her father 's profession did raise suspicions .
merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to be always her best .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state .
michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " around her domestic agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with frank-walter steinmeier , current foreign minister and electoral opponent during the last four years , she was hobbled somewhat by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare make needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . " the chancellor is increasing pensions , the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious german out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political science professor at berlin 's free university . the authenticity factor while merkel is a conservative , she does n't strike people as the fire-and-brimstone kind .
that could be part of her appeal even to young people , according to thomas schneider of the junge union , the youth wing of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
in his opinion , merkel – with her pantsuits and somewhat plodding demeanor – is appreciated for who she is .
it 's a welcome change from glad-handing , million-dollar-smile politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not seen as an archconservative by many " i think that the young generation is expecting authentic people and i do n't think they are looking for someone in their mid-50s or 60s who is playing for them on a playstation " schneider said . he says inspiration also comes from her success in the middle of a party dominated by catholic men -lrb- two things she is not -rrb- , which not so long ago thought women should chair church committees , not g-8 conferences .
merkel , who entered politics only in 1990 , broke that mold . " it 's very impressive how someone can make such enormous progress in such a short time , " he said .
" it 's breathtaking . " author : kyle james editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the outcome of the two polls could n't be more different . both states had been governed by grand coalitions of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , but now it seems as if these alliances will fall apart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's peter harry carstensen is likely to stay in power according to exit polls , the governing cdu in the northernmost state of schleswig-holstein took a little over 31 percent of the vote , with the second largest party , the spd , falling drastically to around 25 percent from some 38 percent in 2005 . the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- climbed to over 15 percent of the vote - their best result in the history of the state election . echoing the nationwide trend , the cdu will now be able to form a coalition with the pro-business free democrats thanks to winning a majority of seats in the state parliament . a shift to the left ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd 's platzeck may test the waters with the left party in brandenburg , however , the social democrats remain the strongest party , despite small losses compared to the 2005 election . exit polls said the spd took around 31 percent of the vote , with the cdu - the spd 's former coalition partner - winning around 21 percent . the second strongest party was the left party , which climbed to around 28 percent of the vote . there is now a very real chance that the spd could join up with the left party , an offshoot of the former ruling party of communist east germany . left party business official dietmar bartsch said it was time for a change in the political atmosphere in brandenburg , calling a coalition with the spd " very possible .

german and chinese organizers have clashed over attendees . " massacre " is the name of the poem written by liao yiwu that sent him to prison for four years .
in it , he condemned the 1989 killings in tiananmen square .
in his book " the corpse walker " - that 's just been published in german - he tells the stories of people from the bottom-rung of chinese society - from a village teacher to a blind street musician - left behind in the country 's economic boom .
the fifty-year-old chinese musician , reporter , and author , was supposed to travel to berlin next month to participate in a panel discussion at the berlin house of world cultures .
but , he says , chinese authorities have banned him from traveling .
" chinese state security officials told me that i will not be allowed to fly to germany , " liao was quoted in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao 's books are available in germany - not in china " for people in the west , it 's the most normal thing in the world to be able to write freely .
in china , we have to fight for this , " he told deutsche welle .
controversy surrounding frankfurt book fair the event at the berlin house of world cultures is one of several connected with the frankfurt book fair , which takes place from october 14-18 .
china has been invited to be this year 's guest nation , but organizers in germany are finding it difficult to work with a country that limits press freedom .
two weeks ago , two chinese dissident writers had their invitations to the frankfurt book fair revoked by german organizers , after china 's organizing committee complained .
the move angered many in germany who felt china was taking charge of the event .
however , china expert matthias von hein says china does not have as much control as critics think .
" china is in a strange position at this book fair because it has been willing to present itself there , knowing that the frankfurt book fair is an event that can not be totally controlled by the propaganda department , " he said .
he added that there are many chinese writers in attendance at these events who have drawn the ire of chinese officials .
press freedom in the " new " china while china 's economic boom has made it a more formidable presence on the world stage - as was demonstrated by its hosting of the 2008 summer olympic games - it still struggles with what face to put forward - one of a modern , open society or one that resembles more of the " old " china . bildunterschrift : critics accused china of using the olympic games as a pr event while at the same time suppressing criticism and dissent within china liao yiwu 's work is still unavailable in his homeland .
and though he is dismayed by his travel ban , he vows never to stop expressing his views .
" even if the authorities try to censor me , i will continue to work .
at least if people read my book , i 'll have made an impact , " he said .
although there has been much controversy surrounding the choice of china as a guest country for the frankfurt book fair , stemming from the past weeks ' events , matthias von hein believes this is a good step for both germany and china .
" i believe it is always good to challenge chinese partners with different concepts of press freedom , human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
and the more opportunities there are , the better it is . " vj / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " if the collapse of the berlin wall marked a watershed in world history , it did all the more so for the countries of central and eastern europe , enabling them to take their rightful place as sovereign actors in the concert of nations , " the pontiff said . the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 . the visit by benedict is a sojourn to the most secular country in europe and comes shortly before the 20th anniversary of the velvet revolution , the peaceful coup which toppled the communist regime of former czechoslovakia . religious beliefs , and especially their display , were banned in communist czechoslovakia , which viewed the church , and religion as a whole , as an enemy of the people .
the regime kept priests under police surveillance and suppressed catholic publications and associations . bildunterschrift : the visit to the czech republic is the first by the head of the roman catholic church since the collapse of communism in 1989 on the sidelines of the papal visit , vatican and czech representatives also discussed the sensitive issue of returning church property confiscated by the communists after world war ii .
a large number of churches , chapels , monasteries , agricultural land and artwork were nationalized by the czech regime at the time . pontiff confronts widely atheist public the pope , however , faces an uphill struggle to bring a religious revival to the country , despite the fall of communism . nearly 60 percent of czechs do not identify with any religion , according to a census taken in 2001 , up from 39 percent a decade earlier , putting the czech republic in stark contrast to neighboring and deeply devout poland .
the percentage of believers , on the other hand , dropped sharply between 1991 and 2001 from almost 44 percent to 32 percent , according to figures from the czech statistics office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few czechs identify with religion but enough came to celebrate mass with the pope that has not deterred the pontiff , however , who said prior to his visit that " after going through the dramas of the past century , -lrb- the czech republic -rrb- needs , like the rest of the continent , to rediscover the reasons for faith and for hope . " church data indicates that there are also more people of faith than the government statistics show , according to jana michalkova , a spokeswoman for the diocese in litomerice , some 80 kilometers north of prague .
but , michalkova admits that half of the churches and chapels in her area were in very poor condition and some sunday masses " served just one or two people . " benedict not visiting former ethnic german region the pope 's agenda in the czech republic includes stopovers in prague , the southeastern city of brno and stara boleslav just outside prague . he will not be visiting the country 's western sudeten region , which was once mostly inhabited by ethnic germans , who were driven from their homes and fled to germany and austria after world war ii . the expulsion of the ethnic german catholics only accelerated the decline of religion in the post-war era and has been a frequent thorn in relations between the czech republic and germany . gb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2009 german voters head to the polls in tight election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62.2 million germans are eligible to vote germans are voting in a keenly-watched national election with chancellor angela merkel likely to win a second term at the helm of europe 's largest economy .
initial voter turnout , however , was lower than in 2005 . despite bright sunshine in large parts of the country , fewer germans turned out to cast their ballots than at the last election , according to the electoral commissioner .
by 12 pm gmt , 36.1 percent of voters had cast their ballots , down from 41.9 percent at the same time in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initial voter turnout was sluggish in total , 62.2 million germans are entitled to vote for 28 parties seeking to enter the lower house of parliament , or bundestag . preliminary exit poll results are expected around 4 pm gmt .
security has been tightened throughout the country on election day in the wake of a series of warnings by islamic militants , including one from al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the messages call on germany to pull some 4,200 troops out of afghanistan . merkel the clear favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's lead has diminished in recent weeks chancellor angela merkel remains the clear favorite to win a second term in power .
but it 's unclear whether she will get the center-right government she says is needed to lift europe 's largest economy out of its worst slump in 60 years . merkel 's conservatives have been in an awkward " grand coalition " with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for the past four years . merkel 's main rival in sunday 's vote is the leader of the spd and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier . the chancellor enjoys high popularity ratings , and opinion polls in recent weeks have given her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- a 8-11 point advantage over their center-left rivals .
the conservatives ' preferred coalition partner is the reform-minded business-friendly free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . should the conservatives , however , fail to win enough support to team up with the fdp , merkel will probably be forced into the same uneasy right-left partnership she has presided over since 2005 . both candidates remain optimistic latest opinion polls show that a continuation of the " grand coalition " could be a likely outcome .
merkel 's lead has shrunk in recent weeks .
a poll by the forsa institute published two days before the vote showed her preferred coalition at 47 percent - not necessarily enough to clinch a clear majority under germany 's complex electoral system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to turn around his party 's fortunes but merkel remained upbeat on the eve of the election .
" i am always optimistic , " she told mass-circulation newspaper bild am sonntag . " voters will decide tomorrow how quickly we get out of this crisis , " merkel told a final rally on saturday .
" we are fighting for the german jobs of the future . " steinmeier , merkel 's rival for the top job , also sounded confident despite a risk that his party could score under the post-war low of 28.8 percent it received in 1953 . " i 've felt a great amount of support and a lot of interest in our cause .
and that 's why i 'm very , very confident about today , " steinmeier told reporters after he cast his vote in berlin on sunday . sp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2009 opinion : new government faces tough task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives are set to form a new government with the pro-business fdp .
dw 's editor-in-chief marc koch says that the new coalition will face a bumpy ride . despite sunday 's resounding victory , angela merkel 's days as chancellor are numbered .
her party , the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will long blame her for the worst result in the history of the party .
merkel will be able to govern for two , perhaps three more years .
then , she will have to make room for someone new .
the rise of the fdp ?
and that 's not only because the business-friendly wing and the culturally-conservative members of merkel 's party sense a new beginning after being held in check by merkel 's internal power system . rather , merkel herself provoked the looming political troubles when she - the most social democratic of politicians within the cdu - decided on an alliance with the liberal fdp before the elections .
now , it will be difficult for her to tackle the problem that she created in the first place . for the fdp , sunday 's election result was nothing less than sensational .
the free democrats received more than 15 percent of the vote - their best result ever .
and the fdp will ensure that it 's paid back for its performance - the party will hardly be content with being considered a mere crutch to help the cdu to a majority .
instead , the fdp will now attempt to translate its vague mantra of tax cuts into real policies .
the party failed to explain to voters before the election how it would do that and there 's little hope it will manage that after the poll .
despite that , the fdp 's success was not surprising .
their simple campaign recipe for the crisis , " down with taxes , " allowed them to address a topic neither the cdu nor the spd were able to , with an issue that moves the masses . and the fdp offered the people a solution that you could accept - or not .
official end of the " grand coalition " as opposed to that , the two main parties , the cdu and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , campaigned for the first time on platforms that were far removed from the people : empty slogans and tepid announcements dominated the campaign appearances of merkel and spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier . that was too dull - even for the germans who are known for their love of security and stability .
germans do n't like confrontation - especially not when it comes to politics .
but germans do want a bit of perspective , some direction and politics that 's close to reality .
but that 's something that the " grand coalition " failed to do in the last four years .
instead , mediocre politics dominated , leaving little room for any big ideas .
and smaller parties have seized the gap created by the bigger parties . the three smaller parties , led by the fdp , have officially made germany a five-party system - and now it 's perhaps their chance to make a significant change .
the unprecedented losses of the spd will certainly contribute to the trend . the spd 's core support base has eroded , the social democrats in their current form need to ask themselves whether their era is over .
if it has plans to resurrect itself at all , it has to reexamine its relationship to oskar lafontaine 's left party .
the spd 's complete rejection of the riotous policies of the left party did it more harm than anything else . the coming years could provide a chance for both steinmeier and the spd to consider new social ideas as they assume their role as opposition leaders .
seen this way , the social democrats could even view their cataclysmic defeat on sunday in a positive light .
they have been rid of any responsibility ; they can now reform themselves in the peace and quiet of the opposition .
above all else , they wo n't be faced with the problems facing germany . that will be the job of angela merkel and her new center-right government .
the center-right alliance has not yet shown that it has a convincing concept .
it will no longer be able to build on a comfortable power-sharing consensus as was the case with the previous left-right coalition .
this election may be the beginning of the end - and not just for angela merkel .
