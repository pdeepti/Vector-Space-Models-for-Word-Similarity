leaders need to agree on goals and financing for a deal at major climate talks in december . kim carstensen is the head of the world wide fund for nature 's global climate initiative .
the wwf and allianz recently released the g-8 climate scorecards 2009 , which rank g-8 members according to their improvements since 1990 , their current status and their policies for the future . deutsche welle : how important of a role do the g-8 countries play in the potential success of climate talks at the end of the year in copenhagen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major economies need to carry the heaviest burden , says carstensen kim carstensen : the level of commitment from developed countries needs to be carried by the biggest and strongest economies , and they are the g-8 countries .
without the g-8 countries coming together and committing to targets , committing to finances , committing to action on adaptation and on support for developing countries - if we do n't get the g-8 countries to come forward and commit to that then it 's going to be impossible to get a strong enough deal in copenhagen in december . looking at the current status of g-8 countries in the wwf report , japan and italy have earned some of the highest scores .
what are they doing that the other six nations are n't ? they have a situation where their actual emissions in italy are relatively low so they have a relatively high efficiency in their economy - so the status they have is relatively good .
but they are not very strong in terms of their action and policies for the future .
japan also has a relatively energy efficient economy and made some very good progress even before the kyoto protocol was established , and therefore its current status is still relatively good . when it comes to plans for the future , the top three g-8 countries - as far as climate change action is concerned - are germany , the united kingdom and france .
are they on target to stay that way ? looking at the policies for the future , none of these countries is actually doing enough to save the world from dangerous climate change and that is the real concern that this exercise shows .
we are not on track to really solve the problem even in the best cases of countries like germany , the uk and france .
even they do not do enough to live up to what they really need to do . if they do n't get competition from the other countries , everything is going to go wrong in terms of climate change .

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .
on thursday , the leaders of the major economies forum -lrb- mef - the g-8 plus brazil , china , india , mexico , south africa , australia , indonesia and south korea -rrb- are to meet in l 'aquila to discuss climate change .
the absence of chinese premier hu jintao , who returned home to deal with ethnic unrest in the country 's west , however , is likely to be a setback , and ahead of the meeting , developing countries resisted suggestions that they should endorse the 2050 goal .
asked whether a deal with china , india and other major developing economies would be reached on thursday , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said : " that is another question . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worldwide emissions cut could be difficult to achieve reinfeldt was present at the meeting as the current holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
light on details what specific measures might be taken to reach the carbon emissions goals , how the cuts will be financed , as well as when emissions would have to begin declining was not addressed in the statement .
" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .
" one year ago it was not possible -lrb- to agree to the two-degree limit -rrb- , our american partners did not accept that , now they accept it .
so there is progress , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "
and that , say scientists , could have catastrophic consequences , such as more heat waves , floods and droughts as well as the extinction of species .
room for greater improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such plumes of smoke are poison to the environment " we do n't have the choice between climate change and no climate change , " gabriel added .
" we have to decide between dangerous and controlable climate change . "
but the last-minute mef meeting , called to offer leaders a chance to agree a united front on climate change ahead of talks on the subject at the g-8 summit in l 'aquila , did not produce a timetable for implementation .
nor indeed , did the talks induce countries such as china and india to agree to a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
but gabriel said he was optimistic that further negotiations ahead of the 15th united nations climate conference at the end of the year , would yield the results the environment needs. tkw / dpa / reuters / ard editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "

netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .

the offer from china hinges on gm agreeing to share propulsion know-how regarding fuel cell and hybrid technologies .
" as you may know , industrialization of a developing country such as china needs to have access to intellectual property .
this is a top priority for the chinese government .
this is the key driver to beijing auto 's potential acquisition of opel newco , " said the offer to general motors .
the offer from baic comes just as gm and magna continue to negotiate the final details of magna 's acquisition of opel .

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .

peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .

netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 08.07.2009 steinmeier ends mideast trip urging leaders to embrace chance for peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier urged al-hariri to use the opportunity for peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has ended his whirlwind trip to the middle east with the message that leaders in the region must make use of the " window of opportunity " for peace opened there by the us . steinmeier had travelled to the middle east in an effort to push for a restart in negotiations over the israeli-palestinian conflict .
the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "
and that , say scientists , could have catastrophic consequences , such as more heat waves , floods and droughts as well as the extinction of species .
room for greater improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such plumes of smoke are poison to the environment " we do n't have the choice between climate change and no climate change , " gabriel added .
" we have to decide between dangerous and controlable climate change . "
but the last-minute mef meeting , called to offer leaders a chance to agree a united front on climate change ahead of talks on the subject at the g-8 summit in l 'aquila , did not produce a timetable for implementation .
nor indeed , did the talks induce countries such as china and india to agree to a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
but gabriel said he was optimistic that further negotiations ahead of the 15th united nations climate conference at the end of the year , would yield the results the environment needs. tkw / dpa / reuters / ard editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the offer from china hinges on gm agreeing to share propulsion know-how regarding fuel cell and hybrid technologies .
" as you may know , industrialization of a developing country such as china needs to have access to intellectual property .
this is a top priority for the chinese government .
this is the key driver to beijing auto 's potential acquisition of opel newco , " said the offer to general motors .
the offer from baic comes just as gm and magna continue to negotiate the final details of magna 's acquisition of opel .
baic said that it would only need a load of 2.64 billion euros , while magna has said that it will need at least 4.5 billion euros .
the german government gave opel a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan in may of this year .
according to baic , it plans to build up a network of 400 dealerships in china with a goal of selling up to half a million opels in china by 2015 .
baic said that it wants to invest up to $ 2.25 billion in its domestic production capacity which would begin in 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 08.07.2009 berlin city palace architect under fire as interior plans are revealed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the architect of the new city palace has come under fire after years of controversy , debate over berlin 's spreeinsel continues .
the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .
17 , 2010 . topics like migration , exchange and power are addressed with exhibits that feature everything from african masks to microscopes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world war two took a toll on the palace even after the clouds over stella 's eligibility have cleared , there promises to be further debate in the future over how the vision for the humboldt forum can best be implemented . for how long this question will occupy the city of berlin is anyone 's guess . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 08.07.2009 g-8 may discuss chinese skepticism over dollar as " world currency " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china thinks it 's time to reconsider the supremacy of the dollar china may not yet be a member of the g-8 group of leading industrial nations .
but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .

the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .

but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 08.07.2009 berlin city palace architect under fire as interior plans are revealed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the architect of the new city palace has come under fire after years of controversy , debate over berlin 's spreeinsel continues .
the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .
17 , 2010 . topics like migration , exchange and power are addressed with exhibits that feature everything from african masks to microscopes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world war two took a toll on the palace even after the clouds over stella 's eligibility have cleared , there promises to be further debate in the future over how the vision for the humboldt forum can best be implemented . for how long this question will occupy the city of berlin is anyone 's guess . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "
and that , say scientists , could have catastrophic consequences , such as more heat waves , floods and droughts as well as the extinction of species .
room for greater improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such plumes of smoke are poison to the environment " we do n't have the choice between climate change and no climate change , " gabriel added .
" we have to decide between dangerous and controlable climate change . "
but the last-minute mef meeting , called to offer leaders a chance to agree a united front on climate change ahead of talks on the subject at the g-8 summit in l 'aquila , did not produce a timetable for implementation .
nor indeed , did the talks induce countries such as china and india to agree to a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
but gabriel said he was optimistic that further negotiations ahead of the 15th united nations climate conference at the end of the year , would yield the results the environment needs. tkw / dpa / reuters / ard editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .

steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .

the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .

the swedish operators said the head of the reactor had broken an agreement with german authorities to install discharge detectors on a transformer . it was a short-circuit on one of the transformers that caused the kruemmel plant to shut down last weekend , thus restricting power supplies across much of the city of hamburg . vattenfall has now said it will not repair the electrical transformers , responsible for the supply of power to on-site machinery , but will replace them entirely .

the news follows an announcement on tuesday that industrial orders had also surged in may . the economics ministry said overall output in europe 's largest economy jumped 3.7 percent in may from the previous month , saying that " industrial production may have bottomed out . "
a breakdown of the output data showed that manufacturing of capital goods , which includes cars , leapt 8.3 percent in may on the month , in part due to the government 's cash-for-clunkers car trade-in scheme , which pays drivers 2,500 euros to scrap an old vehicle and buy a new one .
commerzbank analyst ralf solveen said that foreign demand for german cars also helped and that it was " presumably not just due to the government incentives . "
on a year-to-year basis , however , adjusted overall industrial output fell by nearly 18 percent , indicating how much the economy had contracted in the last year. gb / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .

" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "

so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .

" i recommend to the government that we return to the people to seek their approval for ireland to ratify the treaty , " said cowen .
the prime minister stressed the concessions that ireland had won at the eu at a summit in brussels last month in his endorsement of the treaty .
ireland was granted assurances that it would retain control over tax policy and family law , as well as maintaining its longtime military neutrality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen hopes the concessions he won will be enough " i believe these concerns have been addressed now in the shape of legal guarantees , " cowen told parliament .
about to say yes ?
irish voters threw the lisbon treaty approval process into disarray on june 5 , 2008 , when 54.4 percent cast ballots against it .
next october 2 , the result may be different .
recent polls show the bias of voters for and against the treaty has reversed since the time of last year 's referendum .
moreover , the popular movement which fuelled the ' no ' vote campaign , funded by libertas party founder and millionaire entrepreneur , declan ganley , appears to have petered out .
libertas was dealt a crushing defeat in ireland 's recent european parliament elections , ganley announced his withdrawal from politics , and remaining libertas leaders have since come out in favor of the lisbon treaty .
still , ireland 's political classes are not sure they 've convinced the voters .
" i would not underestimate the strength of feeling of confusion that is out there .
i am not in any way led by opinion polls at this stage which indicate this is just an exercise to be gone through , " said edna kenny , leader of the opposition fine gael party , which supports the treaty .
fine gael , along with prime minister brian cowen 's ruling fianna fail party , both plan to take the case for lisbon to the voters more strongly , ahead of the october 2 vote. mrh / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 08.07.2009 g-8 may discuss chinese skepticism over dollar as " world currency " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china thinks it 's time to reconsider the supremacy of the dollar china may not yet be a member of the g-8 group of leading industrial nations .
but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

the report marked the first time that the imf has sounded an optimistic note since the financial crisis struck last october .
" financial conditions have improved more than expected , " the report says , " owing mainly to public intervention , and recent data suggest that the rate of decline in economic activity is moderating , although to varying degrees among regions . "
the report , released on wednesday in time for the g-8 summit in italy , predicts that the world economy will shrink by 1.4 percent this year , but grow by 2.5 percent in 2010 .
this compares to a forecast in april of a 1.3 percent contraction in 2009 and growth of 1.9 percent next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf is hopeful that the world economy will soon be going in the other direction global recession not yet over the report went on to say , however , that " despite these positive signs , the global recession is not over , and the recovery is still expected to be slow , as financial systems remain impaired . "
the imf projected trade volume would plunge by 12.2 percent this year , a sharp 1.2 points more than forecast in its april weo .
trade would grow 1.0 percent next year , a gain of 0.4 percent from its prior forecast , it said .
the imf urged policymakers to remain vigilant and supportive until growth resumes and deflationary risks recede .
it also said that concerns about rising government debt levels , as a result of higher government spending to shore up economies , highlight the need for stronger medium-term fiscal policy frameworks .
the imf stressed that the world 's economies now needed to begin thinking about rebuilding their financial balances to ensure that sustainable debt loads can be maintained after economic growth has been solidified. gb / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .

" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .

" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .

peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .

demjanjuk was extradited to germany earlier this year to stand trial for being an accessory to murder at the sobibor concentration camp during world war ii .
anja kesting , the constitutional court spokeswoman , said the court would not take up demjanjuk 's challenge because he had not adequately shown that his basic rights had been violated .
his lawyers told associated press that he would appeal to the european court of human rights .
last week , demjanjuk , 89 , was deemed fit for trial by medical officials .
prosecutors in munich have accused him of being a guard at the death camp in nazi-occupied poland and have charged him as an accessory to the murder of 29,000 people .

the report marked the first time that the imf has sounded an optimistic note since the financial crisis struck last october .
" financial conditions have improved more than expected , " the report says , " owing mainly to public intervention , and recent data suggest that the rate of decline in economic activity is moderating , although to varying degrees among regions . "

the news follows an announcement on tuesday that industrial orders had also surged in may . the economics ministry said overall output in europe 's largest economy jumped 3.7 percent in may from the previous month , saying that " industrial production may have bottomed out . "
a breakdown of the output data showed that manufacturing of capital goods , which includes cars , leapt 8.3 percent in may on the month , in part due to the government 's cash-for-clunkers car trade-in scheme , which pays drivers 2,500 euros to scrap an old vehicle and buy a new one .
commerzbank analyst ralf solveen said that foreign demand for german cars also helped and that it was " presumably not just due to the government incentives . "
on a year-to-year basis , however , adjusted overall industrial output fell by nearly 18 percent , indicating how much the economy had contracted in the last year. gb / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the swedish operators said the head of the reactor had broken an agreement with german authorities to install discharge detectors on a transformer . it was a short-circuit on one of the transformers that caused the kruemmel plant to shut down last weekend , thus restricting power supplies across much of the city of hamburg . vattenfall has now said it will not repair the electrical transformers , responsible for the supply of power to on-site machinery , but will replace them entirely .
as a result , the reactor will not resume operations for several months . repeated technical failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2007 fire put kruemmel out of action for two years the latest incident at kruemmel , just one of many problems that have dogged the plant over the past years , has sparked furious political debate over the security of nuclear fuel technology . in 2007 , a fire in a previous transformer at the site led to its closure for two years .
the facility had only been up and running again for two short weeks when saturday 's short-circuit threw it off the national grid once again . social democrat and green politicians have turned the incident into an election campaign issue .
they are calling for germany to speed up nuclear phase-out , currently scheduled for the end of 2020 . call to consumers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have plenty of other electricity suppliers to choose from in an interview in berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , leader of the greens renate kuenast appealed to german consumers to boycott vattenfall to show their growing lack of trust in the company 's operations . " vattenfall customers should put nuclear phase-out first and switch to an eco-electricity provider , " she told the paper . there are 17 nuclear reactors at 12 sites in germany , producing around a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the then-governing social democrat-greens coalition decided in 2000 to decommission all german reactors by 2020 . peter harry carstensen , state premier of schleswig holstein - where the kruemmel plant is located - said he would grant vattenfall " one last chance " to get on top of the problems at the reactor . " if there is one more incident like this , i will see to it that this power station is shut down , " the christian democratic politician told vattenfall head tuomo hatakka in kiel on tuesday . tkw / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de merkel stands firm on nuclear power chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , cdu have rejected opposition calls to accelerate the country 's nuclear phase-out .
they say germany should extend the operational life of the nation 's reactors .
-lrb- 07.07.2009 -rrb- history of vattenfall nuclear power errors stretches back two years the kruemmel nuclear power plant in northern germany had only been back online for two weeks before a malfunction saw it taken back off the power grid .

-lrb- 06.07.2009 -rrb- social democrats push for shift away from nuclear power germany 's social democrats have appealed to chancellor angela merkel to consider an alternative to nuclear fuel .

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .

steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news follows an announcement on tuesday that industrial orders had also surged in may . the economics ministry said overall output in europe 's largest economy jumped 3.7 percent in may from the previous month , saying that " industrial production may have bottomed out . "
a breakdown of the output data showed that manufacturing of capital goods , which includes cars , leapt 8.3 percent in may on the month , in part due to the government 's cash-for-clunkers car trade-in scheme , which pays drivers 2,500 euros to scrap an old vehicle and buy a new one .
commerzbank analyst ralf solveen said that foreign demand for german cars also helped and that it was " presumably not just due to the government incentives . "
on a year-to-year basis , however , adjusted overall industrial output fell by nearly 18 percent , indicating how much the economy had contracted in the last year. gb / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report marked the first time that the imf has sounded an optimistic note since the financial crisis struck last october .
" financial conditions have improved more than expected , " the report says , " owing mainly to public intervention , and recent data suggest that the rate of decline in economic activity is moderating , although to varying degrees among regions . "
the report , released on wednesday in time for the g-8 summit in italy , predicts that the world economy will shrink by 1.4 percent this year , but grow by 2.5 percent in 2010 .
this compares to a forecast in april of a 1.3 percent contraction in 2009 and growth of 1.9 percent next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf is hopeful that the world economy will soon be going in the other direction global recession not yet over the report went on to say , however , that " despite these positive signs , the global recession is not over , and the recovery is still expected to be slow , as financial systems remain impaired . "
the imf projected trade volume would plunge by 12.2 percent this year , a sharp 1.2 points more than forecast in its april weo .
trade would grow 1.0 percent next year , a gain of 0.4 percent from its prior forecast , it said .
the imf urged policymakers to remain vigilant and supportive until growth resumes and deflationary risks recede .
it also said that concerns about rising government debt levels , as a result of higher government spending to shore up economies , highlight the need for stronger medium-term fiscal policy frameworks .
the imf stressed that the world 's economies now needed to begin thinking about rebuilding their financial balances to ensure that sustainable debt loads can be maintained after economic growth has been solidified. gb / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report marked the first time that the imf has sounded an optimistic note since the financial crisis struck last october .
" financial conditions have improved more than expected , " the report says , " owing mainly to public intervention , and recent data suggest that the rate of decline in economic activity is moderating , although to varying degrees among regions . "
the report , released on wednesday in time for the g-8 summit in italy , predicts that the world economy will shrink by 1.4 percent this year , but grow by 2.5 percent in 2010 .
this compares to a forecast in april of a 1.3 percent contraction in 2009 and growth of 1.9 percent next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf is hopeful that the world economy will soon be going in the other direction global recession not yet over the report went on to say , however , that " despite these positive signs , the global recession is not over , and the recovery is still expected to be slow , as financial systems remain impaired . "
the imf projected trade volume would plunge by 12.2 percent this year , a sharp 1.2 points more than forecast in its april weo .
trade would grow 1.0 percent next year , a gain of 0.4 percent from its prior forecast , it said .
the imf urged policymakers to remain vigilant and supportive until growth resumes and deflationary risks recede .
it also said that concerns about rising government debt levels , as a result of higher government spending to shore up economies , highlight the need for stronger medium-term fiscal policy frameworks .
the imf stressed that the world 's economies now needed to begin thinking about rebuilding their financial balances to ensure that sustainable debt loads can be maintained after economic growth has been solidified. gb / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

knut became a global media sensation when his mother rejected him at birth in the berlin animal park , though he never officially belonged to them .
his father , lars , had merely been on loan to berlin for mating , and a contract had pre-determined that his first-born offspring , which happened to be knut , would belong to neumuenster zoo .

merchandise with the bear 's image , including - stamps , candies , and toys - has flown off the shelves .
in 2007 , knut brought in more than five million euros in extra revenue to the berlin zoo and neumuenster sued for a slice of the earnings .
however , judges urged berlin to buy the bear instead .
following an initial request of 700,000 euros for knut , berlin zoo officials said they were only willing to pay neumuenster 350,000 euros , “ the going rate for polar bears ” .
the final settlement of 430,000 euros means that berliners can now rest assured that the now three-year-old knut - the first polar bear to be born and raised there in over 30 years - will remain in the capital permanently. vj / afp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i recommend to the government that we return to the people to seek their approval for ireland to ratify the treaty , " said cowen .
the prime minister stressed the concessions that ireland had won at the eu at a summit in brussels last month in his endorsement of the treaty .
ireland was granted assurances that it would retain control over tax policy and family law , as well as maintaining its longtime military neutrality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen hopes the concessions he won will be enough " i believe these concerns have been addressed now in the shape of legal guarantees , " cowen told parliament .
about to say yes ?
irish voters threw the lisbon treaty approval process into disarray on june 5 , 2008 , when 54.4 percent cast ballots against it .
next october 2 , the result may be different .
recent polls show the bias of voters for and against the treaty has reversed since the time of last year 's referendum .
moreover , the popular movement which fuelled the ' no ' vote campaign , funded by libertas party founder and millionaire entrepreneur , declan ganley , appears to have petered out .
libertas was dealt a crushing defeat in ireland 's recent european parliament elections , ganley announced his withdrawal from politics , and remaining libertas leaders have since come out in favor of the lisbon treaty .
still , ireland 's political classes are not sure they 've convinced the voters .
" i would not underestimate the strength of feeling of confusion that is out there .
i am not in any way led by opinion polls at this stage which indicate this is just an exercise to be gone through , " said edna kenny , leader of the opposition fine gael party , which supports the treaty .
fine gael , along with prime minister brian cowen 's ruling fianna fail party , both plan to take the case for lisbon to the voters more strongly , ahead of the october 2 vote. mrh / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders need to agree on goals and financing for a deal at major climate talks in december . kim carstensen is the head of the world wide fund for nature 's global climate initiative .
the wwf and allianz recently released the g-8 climate scorecards 2009 , which rank g-8 members according to their improvements since 1990 , their current status and their policies for the future . deutsche welle : how important of a role do the g-8 countries play in the potential success of climate talks at the end of the year in copenhagen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major economies need to carry the heaviest burden , says carstensen kim carstensen : the level of commitment from developed countries needs to be carried by the biggest and strongest economies , and they are the g-8 countries .
without the g-8 countries coming together and committing to targets , committing to finances , committing to action on adaptation and on support for developing countries - if we do n't get the g-8 countries to come forward and commit to that then it 's going to be impossible to get a strong enough deal in copenhagen in december . looking at the current status of g-8 countries in the wwf report , japan and italy have earned some of the highest scores .
what are they doing that the other six nations are n't ? they have a situation where their actual emissions in italy are relatively low so they have a relatively high efficiency in their economy - so the status they have is relatively good .
but they are not very strong in terms of their action and policies for the future .
japan also has a relatively energy efficient economy and made some very good progress even before the kyoto protocol was established , and therefore its current status is still relatively good . when it comes to plans for the future , the top three g-8 countries - as far as climate change action is concerned - are germany , the united kingdom and france .
are they on target to stay that way ? looking at the policies for the future , none of these countries is actually doing enough to save the world from dangerous climate change and that is the real concern that this exercise shows .
we are not on track to really solve the problem even in the best cases of countries like germany , the uk and france .
even they do not do enough to live up to what they really need to do . if they do n't get competition from the other countries , everything is going to go wrong in terms of climate change .
if they do get competition , they are still not yet on track - and nobody is at the moment . click on the link in the audio section below to listen to the entire interview with kim carstensen , the head of the global climate initiative at wwf international . interview : mark mattox -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news follows an announcement on tuesday that industrial orders had also surged in may . the economics ministry said overall output in europe 's largest economy jumped 3.7 percent in may from the previous month , saying that " industrial production may have bottomed out . "
a breakdown of the output data showed that manufacturing of capital goods , which includes cars , leapt 8.3 percent in may on the month , in part due to the government 's cash-for-clunkers car trade-in scheme , which pays drivers 2,500 euros to scrap an old vehicle and buy a new one .
commerzbank analyst ralf solveen said that foreign demand for german cars also helped and that it was " presumably not just due to the government incentives . "
on a year-to-year basis , however , adjusted overall industrial output fell by nearly 18 percent , indicating how much the economy had contracted in the last year. gb / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "

the swedish operators said the head of the reactor had broken an agreement with german authorities to install discharge detectors on a transformer . it was a short-circuit on one of the transformers that caused the kruemmel plant to shut down last weekend , thus restricting power supplies across much of the city of hamburg . vattenfall has now said it will not repair the electrical transformers , responsible for the supply of power to on-site machinery , but will replace them entirely .
as a result , the reactor will not resume operations for several months . repeated technical failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2007 fire put kruemmel out of action for two years the latest incident at kruemmel , just one of many problems that have dogged the plant over the past years , has sparked furious political debate over the security of nuclear fuel technology . in 2007 , a fire in a previous transformer at the site led to its closure for two years .
the facility had only been up and running again for two short weeks when saturday 's short-circuit threw it off the national grid once again . social democrat and green politicians have turned the incident into an election campaign issue .

" vattenfall customers should put nuclear phase-out first and switch to an eco-electricity provider , " she told the paper . there are 17 nuclear reactors at 12 sites in germany , producing around a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the then-governing social democrat-greens coalition decided in 2000 to decommission all german reactors by 2020 . peter harry carstensen , state premier of schleswig holstein - where the kruemmel plant is located - said he would grant vattenfall " one last chance " to get on top of the problems at the reactor .

but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "
and that , say scientists , could have catastrophic consequences , such as more heat waves , floods and droughts as well as the extinction of species .
room for greater improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such plumes of smoke are poison to the environment " we do n't have the choice between climate change and no climate change , " gabriel added .
" we have to decide between dangerous and controlable climate change . "
but the last-minute mef meeting , called to offer leaders a chance to agree a united front on climate change ahead of talks on the subject at the g-8 summit in l 'aquila , did not produce a timetable for implementation .
nor indeed , did the talks induce countries such as china and india to agree to a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
but gabriel said he was optimistic that further negotiations ahead of the 15th united nations climate conference at the end of the year , would yield the results the environment needs. tkw / dpa / reuters / ard editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "

the news follows an announcement on tuesday that industrial orders had also surged in may . the economics ministry said overall output in europe 's largest economy jumped 3.7 percent in may from the previous month , saying that " industrial production may have bottomed out . "
a breakdown of the output data showed that manufacturing of capital goods , which includes cars , leapt 8.3 percent in may on the month , in part due to the government 's cash-for-clunkers car trade-in scheme , which pays drivers 2,500 euros to scrap an old vehicle and buy a new one .
commerzbank analyst ralf solveen said that foreign demand for german cars also helped and that it was " presumably not just due to the government incentives . "

without the g-8 countries coming together and committing to targets , committing to finances , committing to action on adaptation and on support for developing countries - if we do n't get the g-8 countries to come forward and commit to that then it 's going to be impossible to get a strong enough deal in copenhagen in december . looking at the current status of g-8 countries in the wwf report , japan and italy have earned some of the highest scores .

but they are not very strong in terms of their action and policies for the future .
japan also has a relatively energy efficient economy and made some very good progress even before the kyoto protocol was established , and therefore its current status is still relatively good . when it comes to plans for the future , the top three g-8 countries - as far as climate change action is concerned - are germany , the united kingdom and france .

without the g-8 countries coming together and committing to targets , committing to finances , committing to action on adaptation and on support for developing countries - if we do n't get the g-8 countries to come forward and commit to that then it 's going to be impossible to get a strong enough deal in copenhagen in december . looking at the current status of g-8 countries in the wwf report , japan and italy have earned some of the highest scores .

japan also has a relatively energy efficient economy and made some very good progress even before the kyoto protocol was established , and therefore its current status is still relatively good . when it comes to plans for the future , the top three g-8 countries - as far as climate change action is concerned - are germany , the united kingdom and france .

the news follows an announcement on tuesday that industrial orders had also surged in may . the economics ministry said overall output in europe 's largest economy jumped 3.7 percent in may from the previous month , saying that " industrial production may have bottomed out . "
a breakdown of the output data showed that manufacturing of capital goods , which includes cars , leapt 8.3 percent in may on the month , in part due to the government 's cash-for-clunkers car trade-in scheme , which pays drivers 2,500 euros to scrap an old vehicle and buy a new one .
commerzbank analyst ralf solveen said that foreign demand for german cars also helped and that it was " presumably not just due to the government incentives . "
on a year-to-year basis , however , adjusted overall industrial output fell by nearly 18 percent , indicating how much the economy had contracted in the last year. gb / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are they on target to stay that way ? looking at the policies for the future , none of these countries is actually doing enough to save the world from dangerous climate change and that is the real concern that this exercise shows .
we are not on track to really solve the problem even in the best cases of countries like germany , the uk and france .
even they do not do enough to live up to what they really need to do . if they do n't get competition from the other countries , everything is going to go wrong in terms of climate change .
if they do get competition , they are still not yet on track - and nobody is at the moment . click on the link in the audio section below to listen to the entire interview with kim carstensen , the head of the global climate initiative at wwf international . interview : mark mattox -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .
on thursday , the leaders of the major economies forum -lrb- mef - the g-8 plus brazil , china , india , mexico , south africa , australia , indonesia and south korea -rrb- are to meet in l 'aquila to discuss climate change .
the absence of chinese premier hu jintao , who returned home to deal with ethnic unrest in the country 's west , however , is likely to be a setback , and ahead of the meeting , developing countries resisted suggestions that they should endorse the 2050 goal .
asked whether a deal with china , india and other major developing economies would be reached on thursday , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said : " that is another question . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worldwide emissions cut could be difficult to achieve reinfeldt was present at the meeting as the current holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
light on details what specific measures might be taken to reach the carbon emissions goals , how the cuts will be financed , as well as when emissions would have to begin declining was not addressed in the statement .
" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .
" one year ago it was not possible -lrb- to agree to the two-degree limit -rrb- , our american partners did not accept that , now they accept it .
so there is progress , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
other topics on the agenda for the remainder of the summit include the nuclear ambitions of north korea , the politically volatile situation in iran , and food security. mrh / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i recommend to the government that we return to the people to seek their approval for ireland to ratify the treaty , " said cowen .
the prime minister stressed the concessions that ireland had won at the eu at a summit in brussels last month in his endorsement of the treaty .
ireland was granted assurances that it would retain control over tax policy and family law , as well as maintaining its longtime military neutrality .

irish voters threw the lisbon treaty approval process into disarray on june 5 , 2008 , when 54.4 percent cast ballots against it .
next october 2 , the result may be different .
recent polls show the bias of voters for and against the treaty has reversed since the time of last year 's referendum .
moreover , the popular movement which fuelled the ' no ' vote campaign , funded by libertas party founder and millionaire entrepreneur , declan ganley , appears to have petered out .
libertas was dealt a crushing defeat in ireland 's recent european parliament elections , ganley announced his withdrawal from politics , and remaining libertas leaders have since come out in favor of the lisbon treaty .
still , ireland 's political classes are not sure they 've convinced the voters .

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .

these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .

the swedish operators said the head of the reactor had broken an agreement with german authorities to install discharge detectors on a transformer . it was a short-circuit on one of the transformers that caused the kruemmel plant to shut down last weekend , thus restricting power supplies across much of the city of hamburg . vattenfall has now said it will not repair the electrical transformers , responsible for the supply of power to on-site machinery , but will replace them entirely .
as a result , the reactor will not resume operations for several months . repeated technical failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2007 fire put kruemmel out of action for two years the latest incident at kruemmel , just one of many problems that have dogged the plant over the past years , has sparked furious political debate over the security of nuclear fuel technology . in 2007 , a fire in a previous transformer at the site led to its closure for two years .
the facility had only been up and running again for two short weeks when saturday 's short-circuit threw it off the national grid once again . social democrat and green politicians have turned the incident into an election campaign issue .
they are calling for germany to speed up nuclear phase-out , currently scheduled for the end of 2020 . call to consumers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have plenty of other electricity suppliers to choose from in an interview in berlin 's tagesspiegel daily , leader of the greens renate kuenast appealed to german consumers to boycott vattenfall to show their growing lack of trust in the company 's operations . " vattenfall customers should put nuclear phase-out first and switch to an eco-electricity provider , " she told the paper . there are 17 nuclear reactors at 12 sites in germany , producing around a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the then-governing social democrat-greens coalition decided in 2000 to decommission all german reactors by 2020 . peter harry carstensen , state premier of schleswig holstein - where the kruemmel plant is located - said he would grant vattenfall " one last chance " to get on top of the problems at the reactor . " if there is one more incident like this , i will see to it that this power station is shut down , " the christian democratic politician told vattenfall head tuomo hatakka in kiel on tuesday . tkw / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de merkel stands firm on nuclear power chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , cdu have rejected opposition calls to accelerate the country 's nuclear phase-out .
they say germany should extend the operational life of the nation 's reactors .
-lrb- 07.07.2009 -rrb- history of vattenfall nuclear power errors stretches back two years the kruemmel nuclear power plant in northern germany had only been back online for two weeks before a malfunction saw it taken back off the power grid .

" i recommend to the government that we return to the people to seek their approval for ireland to ratify the treaty , " said cowen .
the prime minister stressed the concessions that ireland had won at the eu at a summit in brussels last month in his endorsement of the treaty .
ireland was granted assurances that it would retain control over tax policy and family law , as well as maintaining its longtime military neutrality .

irish voters threw the lisbon treaty approval process into disarray on june 5 , 2008 , when 54.4 percent cast ballots against it .
next october 2 , the result may be different .
recent polls show the bias of voters for and against the treaty has reversed since the time of last year 's referendum .
moreover , the popular movement which fuelled the ' no ' vote campaign , funded by libertas party founder and millionaire entrepreneur , declan ganley , appears to have petered out .
libertas was dealt a crushing defeat in ireland 's recent european parliament elections , ganley announced his withdrawal from politics , and remaining libertas leaders have since come out in favor of the lisbon treaty .
still , ireland 's political classes are not sure they 've convinced the voters .
" i would not underestimate the strength of feeling of confusion that is out there .
i am not in any way led by opinion polls at this stage which indicate this is just an exercise to be gone through , " said edna kenny , leader of the opposition fine gael party , which supports the treaty .
fine gael , along with prime minister brian cowen 's ruling fianna fail party , both plan to take the case for lisbon to the voters more strongly , ahead of the october 2 vote. mrh / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news follows an announcement on tuesday that industrial orders had also surged in may . the economics ministry said overall output in europe 's largest economy jumped 3.7 percent in may from the previous month , saying that " industrial production may have bottomed out . "
a breakdown of the output data showed that manufacturing of capital goods , which includes cars , leapt 8.3 percent in may on the month , in part due to the government 's cash-for-clunkers car trade-in scheme , which pays drivers 2,500 euros to scrap an old vehicle and buy a new one .
commerzbank analyst ralf solveen said that foreign demand for german cars also helped and that it was " presumably not just due to the government incentives . "
on a year-to-year basis , however , adjusted overall industrial output fell by nearly 18 percent , indicating how much the economy had contracted in the last year. gb / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 08.07.2009 berlin city palace architect under fire as interior plans are revealed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the architect of the new city palace has come under fire after years of controversy , debate over berlin 's spreeinsel continues .
the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .
17 , 2010 . topics like migration , exchange and power are addressed with exhibits that feature everything from african masks to microscopes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world war two took a toll on the palace even after the clouds over stella 's eligibility have cleared , there promises to be further debate in the future over how the vision for the humboldt forum can best be implemented . for how long this question will occupy the city of berlin is anyone 's guess . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .
on thursday , the leaders of the major economies forum -lrb- mef - the g-8 plus brazil , china , india , mexico , south africa , australia , indonesia and south korea -rrb- are to meet in l 'aquila to discuss climate change .
the absence of chinese premier hu jintao , who returned home to deal with ethnic unrest in the country 's west , however , is likely to be a setback , and ahead of the meeting , developing countries resisted suggestions that they should endorse the 2050 goal .
asked whether a deal with china , india and other major developing economies would be reached on thursday , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said : " that is another question . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worldwide emissions cut could be difficult to achieve reinfeldt was present at the meeting as the current holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
light on details what specific measures might be taken to reach the carbon emissions goals , how the cuts will be financed , as well as when emissions would have to begin declining was not addressed in the statement .
" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .
" one year ago it was not possible -lrb- to agree to the two-degree limit -rrb- , our american partners did not accept that , now they accept it .
so there is progress , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .

these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world war two took a toll on the palace even after the clouds over stella 's eligibility have cleared , there promises to be further debate in the future over how the vision for the humboldt forum can best be implemented . for how long this question will occupy the city of berlin is anyone 's guess . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .
on thursday , the leaders of the major economies forum -lrb- mef - the g-8 plus brazil , china , india , mexico , south africa , australia , indonesia and south korea -rrb- are to meet in l 'aquila to discuss climate change .
the absence of chinese premier hu jintao , who returned home to deal with ethnic unrest in the country 's west , however , is likely to be a setback , and ahead of the meeting , developing countries resisted suggestions that they should endorse the 2050 goal .
asked whether a deal with china , india and other major developing economies would be reached on thursday , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said : " that is another question . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worldwide emissions cut could be difficult to achieve reinfeldt was present at the meeting as the current holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
light on details what specific measures might be taken to reach the carbon emissions goals , how the cuts will be financed , as well as when emissions would have to begin declining was not addressed in the statement .
" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .
" one year ago it was not possible -lrb- to agree to the two-degree limit -rrb- , our american partners did not accept that , now they accept it .
so there is progress , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "

netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report marked the first time that the imf has sounded an optimistic note since the financial crisis struck last october .
" financial conditions have improved more than expected , " the report says , " owing mainly to public intervention , and recent data suggest that the rate of decline in economic activity is moderating , although to varying degrees among regions . "
the report , released on wednesday in time for the g-8 summit in italy , predicts that the world economy will shrink by 1.4 percent this year , but grow by 2.5 percent in 2010 .
this compares to a forecast in april of a 1.3 percent contraction in 2009 and growth of 1.9 percent next year .

"
the imf projected trade volume would plunge by 12.2 percent this year , a sharp 1.2 points more than forecast in its april weo .
trade would grow 1.0 percent next year , a gain of 0.4 percent from its prior forecast , it said .
the imf urged policymakers to remain vigilant and supportive until growth resumes and deflationary risks recede .
it also said that concerns about rising government debt levels , as a result of higher government spending to shore up economies , highlight the need for stronger medium-term fiscal policy frameworks .
the imf stressed that the world 's economies now needed to begin thinking about rebuilding their financial balances to ensure that sustainable debt loads can be maintained after economic growth has been solidified. gb / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

knut became a global media sensation when his mother rejected him at birth in the berlin animal park , though he never officially belonged to them .

merchandise with the bear 's image , including - stamps , candies , and toys - has flown off the shelves .
in 2007 , knut brought in more than five million euros in extra revenue to the berlin zoo and neumuenster sued for a slice of the earnings .
however , judges urged berlin to buy the bear instead .
following an initial request of 700,000 euros for knut , berlin zoo officials said they were only willing to pay neumuenster 350,000 euros , “ the going rate for polar bears ” .
the final settlement of 430,000 euros means that berliners can now rest assured that the now three-year-old knut - the first polar bear to be born and raised there in over 30 years - will remain in the capital permanently. vj / afp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 08.07.2009 berlin city palace architect under fire as interior plans are revealed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the architect of the new city palace has come under fire after years of controversy , debate over berlin 's spreeinsel continues .
the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .
17 , 2010 . topics like migration , exchange and power are addressed with exhibits that feature everything from african masks to microscopes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world war two took a toll on the palace even after the clouds over stella 's eligibility have cleared , there promises to be further debate in the future over how the vision for the humboldt forum can best be implemented . for how long this question will occupy the city of berlin is anyone 's guess . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world war two took a toll on the palace even after the clouds over stella 's eligibility have cleared , there promises to be further debate in the future over how the vision for the humboldt forum can best be implemented . for how long this question will occupy the city of berlin is anyone 's guess . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "
and that , say scientists , could have catastrophic consequences , such as more heat waves , floods and droughts as well as the extinction of species .

but the last-minute mef meeting , called to offer leaders a chance to agree a united front on climate change ahead of talks on the subject at the g-8 summit in l 'aquila , did not produce a timetable for implementation .
nor indeed , did the talks induce countries such as china and india to agree to a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .
on thursday , the leaders of the major economies forum -lrb- mef - the g-8 plus brazil , china , india , mexico , south africa , australia , indonesia and south korea -rrb- are to meet in l 'aquila to discuss climate change .
the absence of chinese premier hu jintao , who returned home to deal with ethnic unrest in the country 's west , however , is likely to be a setback , and ahead of the meeting , developing countries resisted suggestions that they should endorse the 2050 goal .

light on details what specific measures might be taken to reach the carbon emissions goals , how the cuts will be financed , as well as when emissions would have to begin declining was not addressed in the statement .
" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .
" one year ago it was not possible -lrb- to agree to the two-degree limit -rrb- , our american partners did not accept that , now they accept it .
so there is progress , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .

leaders need to agree on goals and financing for a deal at major climate talks in december . kim carstensen is the head of the world wide fund for nature 's global climate initiative .
the wwf and allianz recently released the g-8 climate scorecards 2009 , which rank g-8 members according to their improvements since 1990 , their current status and their policies for the future . deutsche welle : how important of a role do the g-8 countries play in the potential success of climate talks at the end of the year in copenhagen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major economies need to carry the heaviest burden , says carstensen kim carstensen : the level of commitment from developed countries needs to be carried by the biggest and strongest economies , and they are the g-8 countries .
without the g-8 countries coming together and committing to targets , committing to finances , committing to action on adaptation and on support for developing countries - if we do n't get the g-8 countries to come forward and commit to that then it 's going to be impossible to get a strong enough deal in copenhagen in december . looking at the current status of g-8 countries in the wwf report , japan and italy have earned some of the highest scores .
what are they doing that the other six nations are n't ? they have a situation where their actual emissions in italy are relatively low so they have a relatively high efficiency in their economy - so the status they have is relatively good .
but they are not very strong in terms of their action and policies for the future .
japan also has a relatively energy efficient economy and made some very good progress even before the kyoto protocol was established , and therefore its current status is still relatively good . when it comes to plans for the future , the top three g-8 countries - as far as climate change action is concerned - are germany , the united kingdom and france .
are they on target to stay that way ? looking at the policies for the future , none of these countries is actually doing enough to save the world from dangerous climate change and that is the real concern that this exercise shows .
we are not on track to really solve the problem even in the best cases of countries like germany , the uk and france .
even they do not do enough to live up to what they really need to do . if they do n't get competition from the other countries , everything is going to go wrong in terms of climate change .
if they do get competition , they are still not yet on track - and nobody is at the moment . click on the link in the audio section below to listen to the entire interview with kim carstensen , the head of the global climate initiative at wwf international . interview : mark mattox -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 08.07.2009 steinmeier ends mideast trip urging leaders to embrace chance for peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier urged al-hariri to use the opportunity for peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has ended his whirlwind trip to the middle east with the message that leaders in the region must make use of the " window of opportunity " for peace opened there by the us . steinmeier had travelled to the middle east in an effort to push for a restart in negotiations over the israeli-palestinian conflict .
the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "
and that , say scientists , could have catastrophic consequences , such as more heat waves , floods and droughts as well as the extinction of species .
room for greater improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such plumes of smoke are poison to the environment " we do n't have the choice between climate change and no climate change , " gabriel added .
" we have to decide between dangerous and controlable climate change . "
but the last-minute mef meeting , called to offer leaders a chance to agree a united front on climate change ahead of talks on the subject at the g-8 summit in l 'aquila , did not produce a timetable for implementation .
nor indeed , did the talks induce countries such as china and india to agree to a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
but gabriel said he was optimistic that further negotiations ahead of the 15th united nations climate conference at the end of the year , would yield the results the environment needs. tkw / dpa / reuters / ard editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 08.07.2009 italy divided on citizen squads patrolling the streets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city angels have been patrolling the streets in italy for over 15 years they 're known in italy as " ronde " or vigilante groups patrolling major cities .
those who volunteer for them say they help deter street crime .
but critics say they 're a platform for politically motivated bullies . italy 's parliament last week legalized private patrol groups as part of a controversial set of laws aimed at clamping down on crime .
interior minister roberto maroni of the right-wing party lega nord has defended the measure .
maroni said this legislation will help make sure that existing groups adhere to strict regulations : small groups , armed only with mobile phones or walkie-talkies to alert the police .
giorgio marchesich , who is in charge of the regional branch of the volontari verdi in trieste said his group was very happy about the new law .
" now , nobody can accuse us of acting like sheriffs , " marchesich said .
" we do this for the good of the citizens .
there 's a lot of crime around here and we ca n't live in a police state . "
the legislation enables local councils to fund vigilante groups .
in milan , the milano sicura said they were planning new patrols in the coming weeks .
" we 're having a meeting with the residents of an area full of drug dealing , " said member alessandro morelli .
" they 've asked for our help . "
legitimizing vigilantism ?
for years , groups of private citizens - known as " ronde " - have been getting together to patrol the streets of italy 's major cities at night .
some italians have welcomed their presence as a means of discouraging crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do italian police need the extra help ?
but critics said groups like these are intimidating and even racist .
the police union sap is among the strongest voices of opposition .
its president gianni tonelli said police are concerned it is just a way to mask the lack of police officers on the beat .
" it 's a grave error to try to create surrogate law enforcers , " tonelli said .
" the government needs to address the real issue : that every 10 police officers who retire are replaced by just two new officers . "
tonelli said he was hopeful the measure will discipline vigilantes , but is worried they wo n't have the training to deal with situations they encounter .
" we ca n't be their guardian angels , " tonelli said .
gigi leri from the police union silp agreed .
" there 's the risk of racist episodes , clashes between political factions , with fights between vigilantes and anti-vigilantes giving us more work not less , " leri said .
" then the risk , particularly in the south , that organized crime groups could infiltrate these institutionalized security networks thereby gaining even stronger territorial power .
and we , the state police force , would n't be able to do anything about it . "
political implications michele caianiello , professor of criminal law at bologna university , said the legislation risked being interpreted in a non-democratic way .
according to caianiello , it was " uncomfortably reminiscent " of the " ronde nere " or blackshirts - fascist paramilitary patrols organized by benito mussolini after world war one .
" it would have been better to leave this to the spontaneous initiative of local authorities , " caianiello said .
" officially recognizing this way of controlling the territory could give rise to a new kind of association , only apparently private but , in reality , linked to political parties . "
he said he feared supporters of the governing local political party would be favored for approval and funding .
the seasoned patroller mario furlan founded his patrol group , the city angels , in 1994 .
he said he 's concerned about the new squads that have been appearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : furlan says the city angels make the streets more friendly and secure " i 'm afraid new groups wo n't have our humanitarian spirit , " furlan said .
" the classic vigilante is a person who goes on the streets to look for an enemy .
we go on the streets to look for people to help . "
members of the city angels receive three months of training in psychology , communication , first-aid and self-defense .
furlan said his squad helped citizens in bad areas .
" people feel safe when we are there , " furlan said .
" the homeless feel we are friends and criminals see us as a visual deterrent . "
but they are not the police and are not only focusing on security , he said .

those who volunteer for them say they help deter street crime .
but critics say they 're a platform for politically motivated bullies . italy 's parliament last week legalized private patrol groups as part of a controversial set of laws aimed at clamping down on crime .
interior minister roberto maroni of the right-wing party lega nord has defended the measure .
maroni said this legislation will help make sure that existing groups adhere to strict regulations : small groups , armed only with mobile phones or walkie-talkies to alert the police .
giorgio marchesich , who is in charge of the regional branch of the volontari verdi in trieste said his group was very happy about the new law .
" now , nobody can accuse us of acting like sheriffs , " marchesich said .
" we do this for the good of the citizens .
there 's a lot of crime around here and we ca n't live in a police state . "
the legislation enables local councils to fund vigilante groups .
in milan , the milano sicura said they were planning new patrols in the coming weeks .
" we 're having a meeting with the residents of an area full of drug dealing , " said member alessandro morelli .
" they 've asked for our help . "
legitimizing vigilantism ?
for years , groups of private citizens - known as " ronde " - have been getting together to patrol the streets of italy 's major cities at night .
some italians have welcomed their presence as a means of discouraging crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do italian police need the extra help ?
but critics said groups like these are intimidating and even racist .
the police union sap is among the strongest voices of opposition .
its president gianni tonelli said police are concerned it is just a way to mask the lack of police officers on the beat .
" it 's a grave error to try to create surrogate law enforcers , " tonelli said .
" the government needs to address the real issue : that every 10 police officers who retire are replaced by just two new officers . "
tonelli said he was hopeful the measure will discipline vigilantes , but is worried they wo n't have the training to deal with situations they encounter .
" we ca n't be their guardian angels , " tonelli said .
gigi leri from the police union silp agreed .
" there 's the risk of racist episodes , clashes between political factions , with fights between vigilantes and anti-vigilantes giving us more work not less , " leri said .
" then the risk , particularly in the south , that organized crime groups could infiltrate these institutionalized security networks thereby gaining even stronger territorial power .

those who volunteer for them say they help deter street crime .
but critics say they 're a platform for politically motivated bullies . italy 's parliament last week legalized private patrol groups as part of a controversial set of laws aimed at clamping down on crime .
interior minister roberto maroni of the right-wing party lega nord has defended the measure .
maroni said this legislation will help make sure that existing groups adhere to strict regulations : small groups , armed only with mobile phones or walkie-talkies to alert the police .
giorgio marchesich , who is in charge of the regional branch of the volontari verdi in trieste said his group was very happy about the new law .
" now , nobody can accuse us of acting like sheriffs , " marchesich said .
" we do this for the good of the citizens .
there 's a lot of crime around here and we ca n't live in a police state . "
the legislation enables local councils to fund vigilante groups .
in milan , the milano sicura said they were planning new patrols in the coming weeks .
" we 're having a meeting with the residents of an area full of drug dealing , " said member alessandro morelli .
" they 've asked for our help . "
legitimizing vigilantism ?
for years , groups of private citizens - known as " ronde " - have been getting together to patrol the streets of italy 's major cities at night .
some italians have welcomed their presence as a means of discouraging crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do italian police need the extra help ?
but critics said groups like these are intimidating and even racist .
the police union sap is among the strongest voices of opposition .
its president gianni tonelli said police are concerned it is just a way to mask the lack of police officers on the beat .
" it 's a grave error to try to create surrogate law enforcers , " tonelli said .
" the government needs to address the real issue : that every 10 police officers who retire are replaced by just two new officers . "
tonelli said he was hopeful the measure will discipline vigilantes , but is worried they wo n't have the training to deal with situations they encounter .
" we ca n't be their guardian angels , " tonelli said .
gigi leri from the police union silp agreed .
" there 's the risk of racist episodes , clashes between political factions , with fights between vigilantes and anti-vigilantes giving us more work not less , " leri said .
" then the risk , particularly in the south , that organized crime groups could infiltrate these institutionalized security networks thereby gaining even stronger territorial power .
and we , the state police force , would n't be able to do anything about it . "
political implications michele caianiello , professor of criminal law at bologna university , said the legislation risked being interpreted in a non-democratic way .
according to caianiello , it was " uncomfortably reminiscent " of the " ronde nere " or blackshirts - fascist paramilitary patrols organized by benito mussolini after world war one .
" it would have been better to leave this to the spontaneous initiative of local authorities , " caianiello said .
" officially recognizing this way of controlling the territory could give rise to a new kind of association , only apparently private but , in reality , linked to political parties . "
he said he feared supporters of the governing local political party would be favored for approval and funding .
the seasoned patroller mario furlan founded his patrol group , the city angels , in 1994 .
he said he 's concerned about the new squads that have been appearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : furlan says the city angels make the streets more friendly and secure " i 'm afraid new groups wo n't have our humanitarian spirit , " furlan said .
" the classic vigilante is a person who goes on the streets to look for an enemy .
we go on the streets to look for people to help . "
members of the city angels receive three months of training in psychology , communication , first-aid and self-defense .
furlan said his squad helped citizens in bad areas .
" people feel safe when we are there , " furlan said .
" the homeless feel we are friends and criminals see us as a visual deterrent . "
but they are not the police and are not only focusing on security , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 08.07.2009 berlin city palace architect under fire as interior plans are revealed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the architect of the new city palace has come under fire after years of controversy , debate over berlin 's spreeinsel continues .
the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .
17 , 2010 . topics like migration , exchange and power are addressed with exhibits that feature everything from african masks to microscopes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world war two took a toll on the palace even after the clouds over stella 's eligibility have cleared , there promises to be further debate in the future over how the vision for the humboldt forum can best be implemented . for how long this question will occupy the city of berlin is anyone 's guess . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 08.07.2009 berlin city palace architect under fire as interior plans are revealed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the architect of the new city palace has come under fire after years of controversy , debate over berlin 's spreeinsel continues .
the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .
17 , 2010 . topics like migration , exchange and power are addressed with exhibits that feature everything from african masks to microscopes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world war two took a toll on the palace even after the clouds over stella 's eligibility have cleared , there promises to be further debate in the future over how the vision for the humboldt forum can best be implemented . for how long this question will occupy the city of berlin is anyone 's guess . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report marked the first time that the imf has sounded an optimistic note since the financial crisis struck last october .
" financial conditions have improved more than expected , " the report says , " owing mainly to public intervention , and recent data suggest that the rate of decline in economic activity is moderating , although to varying degrees among regions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 08.07.2009 berlin city palace architect under fire as interior plans are revealed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the architect of the new city palace has come under fire after years of controversy , debate over berlin 's spreeinsel continues .
the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .
17 , 2010 . topics like migration , exchange and power are addressed with exhibits that feature everything from african masks to microscopes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world war two took a toll on the palace even after the clouds over stella 's eligibility have cleared , there promises to be further debate in the future over how the vision for the humboldt forum can best be implemented . for how long this question will occupy the city of berlin is anyone 's guess . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i recommend to the government that we return to the people to seek their approval for ireland to ratify the treaty , " said cowen .
the prime minister stressed the concessions that ireland had won at the eu at a summit in brussels last month in his endorsement of the treaty .
ireland was granted assurances that it would retain control over tax policy and family law , as well as maintaining its longtime military neutrality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen hopes the concessions he won will be enough " i believe these concerns have been addressed now in the shape of legal guarantees , " cowen told parliament .
about to say yes ?
irish voters threw the lisbon treaty approval process into disarray on june 5 , 2008 , when 54.4 percent cast ballots against it .
next october 2 , the result may be different .
recent polls show the bias of voters for and against the treaty has reversed since the time of last year 's referendum .
moreover , the popular movement which fuelled the ' no ' vote campaign , funded by libertas party founder and millionaire entrepreneur , declan ganley , appears to have petered out .
libertas was dealt a crushing defeat in ireland 's recent european parliament elections , ganley announced his withdrawal from politics , and remaining libertas leaders have since come out in favor of the lisbon treaty .
still , ireland 's political classes are not sure they 've convinced the voters .
" i would not underestimate the strength of feeling of confusion that is out there .
i am not in any way led by opinion polls at this stage which indicate this is just an exercise to be gone through , " said edna kenny , leader of the opposition fine gael party , which supports the treaty .

the offer from china hinges on gm agreeing to share propulsion know-how regarding fuel cell and hybrid technologies .
" as you may know , industrialization of a developing country such as china needs to have access to intellectual property .
this is a top priority for the chinese government .
this is the key driver to beijing auto 's potential acquisition of opel newco , " said the offer to general motors .
the offer from baic comes just as gm and magna continue to negotiate the final details of magna 's acquisition of opel .
baic said that it would only need a load of 2.64 billion euros , while magna has said that it will need at least 4.5 billion euros .
the german government gave opel a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan in may of this year .
according to baic , it plans to build up a network of 400 dealerships in china with a goal of selling up to half a million opels in china by 2015 .
baic said that it wants to invest up to $ 2.25 billion in its domestic production capacity which would begin in 2012 .
if its bid is successful , baic has said that it would eliminate just over 7,500 opel jobs , 3,000 of which are in germany. av / reuters / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .

a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .
on thursday , the leaders of the major economies forum -lrb- mef - the g-8 plus brazil , china , india , mexico , south africa , australia , indonesia and south korea -rrb- are to meet in l 'aquila to discuss climate change .
the absence of chinese premier hu jintao , who returned home to deal with ethnic unrest in the country 's west , however , is likely to be a setback , and ahead of the meeting , developing countries resisted suggestions that they should endorse the 2050 goal .
asked whether a deal with china , india and other major developing economies would be reached on thursday , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said : " that is another question . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worldwide emissions cut could be difficult to achieve reinfeldt was present at the meeting as the current holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
light on details what specific measures might be taken to reach the carbon emissions goals , how the cuts will be financed , as well as when emissions would have to begin declining was not addressed in the statement .
" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .
" one year ago it was not possible -lrb- to agree to the two-degree limit -rrb- , our american partners did not accept that , now they accept it .
so there is progress , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
other topics on the agenda for the remainder of the summit include the nuclear ambitions of north korea , the politically volatile situation in iran , and food security. mrh / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

knut became a global media sensation when his mother rejected him at birth in the berlin animal park , though he never officially belonged to them .
his father , lars , had merely been on loan to berlin for mating , and a contract had pre-determined that his first-born offspring , which happened to be knut , would belong to neumuenster zoo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has generated millions of euros for the berlin zoo however , neither zoo could have predicted just how beloved and lucrative the fluffy , white cub would become .
since his birth , tourists and camera crews have n't been able to get enough of the orphaned bear who had to be hand-raised and bottle-fed by zoo staff .
merchandise with the bear 's image , including - stamps , candies , and toys - has flown off the shelves .
in 2007 , knut brought in more than five million euros in extra revenue to the berlin zoo and neumuenster sued for a slice of the earnings .
however , judges urged berlin to buy the bear instead .
following an initial request of 700,000 euros for knut , berlin zoo officials said they were only willing to pay neumuenster 350,000 euros , “ the going rate for polar bears ” .
the final settlement of 430,000 euros means that berliners can now rest assured that the now three-year-old knut - the first polar bear to be born and raised there in over 30 years - will remain in the capital permanently. vj / afp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 08.07.2009 g-8 may discuss chinese skepticism over dollar as " world currency " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china thinks it 's time to reconsider the supremacy of the dollar china may not yet be a member of the g-8 group of leading industrial nations .
but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

the report marked the first time that the imf has sounded an optimistic note since the financial crisis struck last october .
" financial conditions have improved more than expected , " the report says , " owing mainly to public intervention , and recent data suggest that the rate of decline in economic activity is moderating , although to varying degrees among regions . "
the report , released on wednesday in time for the g-8 summit in italy , predicts that the world economy will shrink by 1.4 percent this year , but grow by 2.5 percent in 2010 .
this compares to a forecast in april of a 1.3 percent contraction in 2009 and growth of 1.9 percent next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf is hopeful that the world economy will soon be going in the other direction global recession not yet over the report went on to say , however , that " despite these positive signs , the global recession is not over , and the recovery is still expected to be slow , as financial systems remain impaired . "
the imf projected trade volume would plunge by 12.2 percent this year , a sharp 1.2 points more than forecast in its april weo .
trade would grow 1.0 percent next year , a gain of 0.4 percent from its prior forecast , it said .
the imf urged policymakers to remain vigilant and supportive until growth resumes and deflationary risks recede .
it also said that concerns about rising government debt levels , as a result of higher government spending to shore up economies , highlight the need for stronger medium-term fiscal policy frameworks .
the imf stressed that the world 's economies now needed to begin thinking about rebuilding their financial balances to ensure that sustainable debt loads can be maintained after economic growth has been solidified. gb / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is a top priority for the chinese government .

the offer from china hinges on gm agreeing to share propulsion know-how regarding fuel cell and hybrid technologies .
" as you may know , industrialization of a developing country such as china needs to have access to intellectual property .
this is a top priority for the chinese government .
this is the key driver to beijing auto 's potential acquisition of opel newco , " said the offer to general motors .
the offer from baic comes just as gm and magna continue to negotiate the final details of magna 's acquisition of opel .
baic said that it would only need a load of 2.64 billion euros , while magna has said that it will need at least 4.5 billion euros .
the german government gave opel a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan in may of this year .
according to baic , it plans to build up a network of 400 dealerships in china with a goal of selling up to half a million opels in china by 2015 .
baic said that it wants to invest up to $ 2.25 billion in its domestic production capacity which would begin in 2012 .
if its bid is successful , baic has said that it would eliminate just over 7,500 opel jobs , 3,000 of which are in germany. av / reuters / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "
and that , say scientists , could have catastrophic consequences , such as more heat waves , floods and droughts as well as the extinction of species .
room for greater improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such plumes of smoke are poison to the environment " we do n't have the choice between climate change and no climate change , " gabriel added .
" we have to decide between dangerous and controlable climate change . "
but the last-minute mef meeting , called to offer leaders a chance to agree a united front on climate change ahead of talks on the subject at the g-8 summit in l 'aquila , did not produce a timetable for implementation .
nor indeed , did the talks induce countries such as china and india to agree to a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
but gabriel said he was optimistic that further negotiations ahead of the 15th united nations climate conference at the end of the year , would yield the results the environment needs. tkw / dpa / reuters / ard editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .

steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "

steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "
and that , say scientists , could have catastrophic consequences , such as more heat waves , floods and droughts as well as the extinction of species .
room for greater improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such plumes of smoke are poison to the environment " we do n't have the choice between climate change and no climate change , " gabriel added .
" we have to decide between dangerous and controlable climate change . "
but the last-minute mef meeting , called to offer leaders a chance to agree a united front on climate change ahead of talks on the subject at the g-8 summit in l 'aquila , did not produce a timetable for implementation .
nor indeed , did the talks induce countries such as china and india to agree to a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
but gabriel said he was optimistic that further negotiations ahead of the 15th united nations climate conference at the end of the year , would yield the results the environment needs. tkw / dpa / reuters / ard editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .

but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 08.07.2009 g-8 may discuss chinese skepticism over dollar as " world currency " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china thinks it 's time to reconsider the supremacy of the dollar china may not yet be a member of the g-8 group of leading industrial nations .
but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .

leaders need to agree on goals and financing for a deal at major climate talks in december . kim carstensen is the head of the world wide fund for nature 's global climate initiative .
the wwf and allianz recently released the g-8 climate scorecards 2009 , which rank g-8 members according to their improvements since 1990 , their current status and their policies for the future . deutsche welle : how important of a role do the g-8 countries play in the potential success of climate talks at the end of the year in copenhagen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major economies need to carry the heaviest burden , says carstensen kim carstensen : the level of commitment from developed countries needs to be carried by the biggest and strongest economies , and they are the g-8 countries .
without the g-8 countries coming together and committing to targets , committing to finances , committing to action on adaptation and on support for developing countries - if we do n't get the g-8 countries to come forward and commit to that then it 's going to be impossible to get a strong enough deal in copenhagen in december . looking at the current status of g-8 countries in the wwf report , japan and italy have earned some of the highest scores .
what are they doing that the other six nations are n't ? they have a situation where their actual emissions in italy are relatively low so they have a relatively high efficiency in their economy - so the status they have is relatively good .
but they are not very strong in terms of their action and policies for the future .
japan also has a relatively energy efficient economy and made some very good progress even before the kyoto protocol was established , and therefore its current status is still relatively good . when it comes to plans for the future , the top three g-8 countries - as far as climate change action is concerned - are germany , the united kingdom and france .
are they on target to stay that way ? looking at the policies for the future , none of these countries is actually doing enough to save the world from dangerous climate change and that is the real concern that this exercise shows .
we are not on track to really solve the problem even in the best cases of countries like germany , the uk and france .
even they do not do enough to live up to what they really need to do . if they do n't get competition from the other countries , everything is going to go wrong in terms of climate change .

demjanjuk was extradited to germany earlier this year to stand trial for being an accessory to murder at the sobibor concentration camp during world war ii .

his lawyers told associated press that he would appeal to the european court of human rights .

prosecutors in munich have accused him of being a guard at the death camp in nazi-occupied poland and have charged him as an accessory to the murder of 29,000 people .

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "
and that , say scientists , could have catastrophic consequences , such as more heat waves , floods and droughts as well as the extinction of species .
room for greater improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such plumes of smoke are poison to the environment " we do n't have the choice between climate change and no climate change , " gabriel added .
" we have to decide between dangerous and controlable climate change . "
but the last-minute mef meeting , called to offer leaders a chance to agree a united front on climate change ahead of talks on the subject at the g-8 summit in l 'aquila , did not produce a timetable for implementation .
nor indeed , did the talks induce countries such as china and india to agree to a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
but gabriel said he was optimistic that further negotiations ahead of the 15th united nations climate conference at the end of the year , would yield the results the environment needs. tkw / dpa / reuters / ard editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "

these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "
this would include arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with israel even before a palestinian state is created. dfm / hf / glb / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the initiative by us president barack obama " creates many opportunities that we need to use now , " he said after meeting with lebanese prime minister designate saad al-hariri in beirut on tuesday .
" that 's why all the partners must take part constructively in this process and make their positions clear quickly before the window of opportunity closes . "
the obama administration has repeatedly called on israel to halt settlement activity in the occupied west bank and has demanded that the jewish state endorse a two-state solution , which would see the creation of a palestinian state next to israel .
steinmeier , who is also german deputy chancellor , went on to congratulate al-hariri on his recent election victory and wish him success in forming a new cabinet .
his election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country , steinmeier added .
steinmeier said that he and al-hariri " agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by us president barack obama " in furthering the middle east peace process .
syrian stopover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called on syria to " do its part " the german foreign minister had arrived in lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in syria and israel .
steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad were unable to reach an agreement on resuming contact between israel and syria during their talks in damascus , which also involved syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem .
" syria has an objective interest in the success of the middle east peace process , " said steinmeier , " and i call on syria and also my counterpart mr. al-moallem to do their part . "
contact between israel and syria was suspended after israel 's military offensive on the gaza strip , which began in december last year and continued through to january .
al-moallem reiterated that syria would not give up its claim on the golan heights , which israel has occupied since the six day war in 1967 .
steinmeier specifically named hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process .
the lebanon-based organization relies on syria for some financial support .
the talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in syria , as the european union has promised to support damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record .
steinmeier said he would call on syria to continue its trend of openness , which he said had improved in recent months .
israeli talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria 's foreign minister says his country will maintain its claim to the golan heights another hot topic was syria 's close relationship with iran .
during meetings with israeli president shimon peres on monday , steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in syria .
peres asked steinmeier to tell the syrian president that , if damascus continued to have such close ties with iran , israel would be hesitant to return the golan heights to syria .
steinmeier had traveled to syria from jerusalem , where he 'd also met with the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , on monday .
the german foreign minister welcomed netanyahu 's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of palestinians in the west bank a " small start . "
he added that the " road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the palestinian side .
my personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution . "
reciprocity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier welcomed netanyahu 's endorsement of the two-state solution netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution , but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized palestinian state in a june 14 policy speech , following intense pressure from the us and europe . despite this , netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , which the palestinians , along with nations including egypt and jordan , have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations .
netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of " reciprocity , " insisting on palestinian and arab counter-steps in exchange for any israeli " concessions . "

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .
on thursday , the leaders of the major economies forum -lrb- mef - the g-8 plus brazil , china , india , mexico , south africa , australia , indonesia and south korea -rrb- are to meet in l 'aquila to discuss climate change .
the absence of chinese premier hu jintao , who returned home to deal with ethnic unrest in the country 's west , however , is likely to be a setback , and ahead of the meeting , developing countries resisted suggestions that they should endorse the 2050 goal .
asked whether a deal with china , india and other major developing economies would be reached on thursday , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said : " that is another question . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worldwide emissions cut could be difficult to achieve reinfeldt was present at the meeting as the current holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
light on details what specific measures might be taken to reach the carbon emissions goals , how the cuts will be financed , as well as when emissions would have to begin declining was not addressed in the statement .
" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .
" one year ago it was not possible -lrb- to agree to the two-degree limit -rrb- , our american partners did not accept that , now they accept it .
so there is progress , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
other topics on the agenda for the remainder of the summit include the nuclear ambitions of north korea , the politically volatile situation in iran , and food security. mrh / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .
on thursday , the leaders of the major economies forum -lrb- mef - the g-8 plus brazil , china , india , mexico , south africa , australia , indonesia and south korea -rrb- are to meet in l 'aquila to discuss climate change .
the absence of chinese premier hu jintao , who returned home to deal with ethnic unrest in the country 's west , however , is likely to be a setback , and ahead of the meeting , developing countries resisted suggestions that they should endorse the 2050 goal .
asked whether a deal with china , india and other major developing economies would be reached on thursday , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said : " that is another question . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worldwide emissions cut could be difficult to achieve reinfeldt was present at the meeting as the current holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
light on details what specific measures might be taken to reach the carbon emissions goals , how the cuts will be financed , as well as when emissions would have to begin declining was not addressed in the statement .
" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .
" one year ago it was not possible -lrb- to agree to the two-degree limit -rrb- , our american partners did not accept that , now they accept it .
so there is progress , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
other topics on the agenda for the remainder of the summit include the nuclear ambitions of north korea , the politically volatile situation in iran , and food security. mrh / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

knut became a global media sensation when his mother rejected him at birth in the berlin animal park , though he never officially belonged to them .
his father , lars , had merely been on loan to berlin for mating , and a contract had pre-determined that his first-born offspring , which happened to be knut , would belong to neumuenster zoo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has generated millions of euros for the berlin zoo however , neither zoo could have predicted just how beloved and lucrative the fluffy , white cub would become .
since his birth , tourists and camera crews have n't been able to get enough of the orphaned bear who had to be hand-raised and bottle-fed by zoo staff .
merchandise with the bear 's image , including - stamps , candies , and toys - has flown off the shelves .
in 2007 , knut brought in more than five million euros in extra revenue to the berlin zoo and neumuenster sued for a slice of the earnings .
however , judges urged berlin to buy the bear instead .
following an initial request of 700,000 euros for knut , berlin zoo officials said they were only willing to pay neumuenster 350,000 euros , “ the going rate for polar bears ” .
the final settlement of 430,000 euros means that berliners can now rest assured that the now three-year-old knut - the first polar bear to be born and raised there in over 30 years - will remain in the capital permanently. vj / afp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i recommend to the government that we return to the people to seek their approval for ireland to ratify the treaty , " said cowen .
the prime minister stressed the concessions that ireland had won at the eu at a summit in brussels last month in his endorsement of the treaty .
ireland was granted assurances that it would retain control over tax policy and family law , as well as maintaining its longtime military neutrality .

irish voters threw the lisbon treaty approval process into disarray on june 5 , 2008 , when 54.4 percent cast ballots against it .

moreover , the popular movement which fuelled the ' no ' vote campaign , funded by libertas party founder and millionaire entrepreneur , declan ganley , appears to have petered out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 08.07.2009 g-8 may discuss chinese skepticism over dollar as " world currency " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china thinks it 's time to reconsider the supremacy of the dollar china may not yet be a member of the g-8 group of leading industrial nations .
but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

the swedish operators said the head of the reactor had broken an agreement with german authorities to install discharge detectors on a transformer . it was a short-circuit on one of the transformers that caused the kruemmel plant to shut down last weekend , thus restricting power supplies across much of the city of hamburg . vattenfall has now said it will not repair the electrical transformers , responsible for the supply of power to on-site machinery , but will replace them entirely .

the offer from china hinges on gm agreeing to share propulsion know-how regarding fuel cell and hybrid technologies .
" as you may know , industrialization of a developing country such as china needs to have access to intellectual property .
this is a top priority for the chinese government .
this is the key driver to beijing auto 's potential acquisition of opel newco , " said the offer to general motors .
the offer from baic comes just as gm and magna continue to negotiate the final details of magna 's acquisition of opel .
baic said that it would only need a load of 2.64 billion euros , while magna has said that it will need at least 4.5 billion euros .
the german government gave opel a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan in may of this year .
according to baic , it plans to build up a network of 400 dealerships in china with a goal of selling up to half a million opels in china by 2015 .
baic said that it wants to invest up to $ 2.25 billion in its domestic production capacity which would begin in 2012 .
if its bid is successful , baic has said that it would eliminate just over 7,500 opel jobs , 3,000 of which are in germany. av / reuters / dpa / ap editor : michael lawton michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "
and that , say scientists , could have catastrophic consequences , such as more heat waves , floods and droughts as well as the extinction of species .
room for greater improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such plumes of smoke are poison to the environment " we do n't have the choice between climate change and no climate change , " gabriel added .
" we have to decide between dangerous and controlable climate change . "
but the last-minute mef meeting , called to offer leaders a chance to agree a united front on climate change ahead of talks on the subject at the g-8 summit in l 'aquila , did not produce a timetable for implementation .
nor indeed , did the talks induce countries such as china and india to agree to a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
but gabriel said he was optimistic that further negotiations ahead of the 15th united nations climate conference at the end of the year , would yield the results the environment needs. tkw / dpa / reuters / ard editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "
and that , say scientists , could have catastrophic consequences , such as more heat waves , floods and droughts as well as the extinction of species .

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .

" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .
" one year ago it was not possible -lrb- to agree to the two-degree limit -rrb- , our american partners did not accept that , now they accept it .

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .
on thursday , the leaders of the major economies forum -lrb- mef - the g-8 plus brazil , china , india , mexico , south africa , australia , indonesia and south korea -rrb- are to meet in l 'aquila to discuss climate change .

" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .
" one year ago it was not possible -lrb- to agree to the two-degree limit -rrb- , our american partners did not accept that , now they accept it .
so there is progress , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .

leaders need to agree on goals and financing for a deal at major climate talks in december . kim carstensen is the head of the world wide fund for nature 's global climate initiative .
the wwf and allianz recently released the g-8 climate scorecards 2009 , which rank g-8 members according to their improvements since 1990 , their current status and their policies for the future . deutsche welle : how important of a role do the g-8 countries play in the potential success of climate talks at the end of the year in copenhagen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major economies need to carry the heaviest burden , says carstensen kim carstensen : the level of commitment from developed countries needs to be carried by the biggest and strongest economies , and they are the g-8 countries .
without the g-8 countries coming together and committing to targets , committing to finances , committing to action on adaptation and on support for developing countries - if we do n't get the g-8 countries to come forward and commit to that then it 's going to be impossible to get a strong enough deal in copenhagen in december . looking at the current status of g-8 countries in the wwf report , japan and italy have earned some of the highest scores .
what are they doing that the other six nations are n't ? they have a situation where their actual emissions in italy are relatively low so they have a relatively high efficiency in their economy - so the status they have is relatively good .
but they are not very strong in terms of their action and policies for the future .
japan also has a relatively energy efficient economy and made some very good progress even before the kyoto protocol was established , and therefore its current status is still relatively good . when it comes to plans for the future , the top three g-8 countries - as far as climate change action is concerned - are germany , the united kingdom and france .
are they on target to stay that way ? looking at the policies for the future , none of these countries is actually doing enough to save the world from dangerous climate change and that is the real concern that this exercise shows .
we are not on track to really solve the problem even in the best cases of countries like germany , the uk and france .
even they do not do enough to live up to what they really need to do . if they do n't get competition from the other countries , everything is going to go wrong in terms of climate change .
if they do get competition , they are still not yet on track - and nobody is at the moment . click on the link in the audio section below to listen to the entire interview with kim carstensen , the head of the global climate initiative at wwf international . interview : mark mattox -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

irish voters threw the lisbon treaty approval process into disarray on june 5 , 2008 , when 54.4 percent cast ballots against it .

recent polls show the bias of voters for and against the treaty has reversed since the time of last year 's referendum .
moreover , the popular movement which fuelled the ' no ' vote campaign , funded by libertas party founder and millionaire entrepreneur , declan ganley , appears to have petered out .
libertas was dealt a crushing defeat in ireland 's recent european parliament elections , ganley announced his withdrawal from politics , and remaining libertas leaders have since come out in favor of the lisbon treaty .
still , ireland 's political classes are not sure they 've convinced the voters .
" i would not underestimate the strength of feeling of confusion that is out there .
i am not in any way led by opinion polls at this stage which indicate this is just an exercise to be gone through , " said edna kenny , leader of the opposition fine gael party , which supports the treaty .

knut became a global media sensation when his mother rejected him at birth in the berlin animal park , though he never officially belonged to them .
his father , lars , had merely been on loan to berlin for mating , and a contract had pre-determined that his first-born offspring , which happened to be knut , would belong to neumuenster zoo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has generated millions of euros for the berlin zoo however , neither zoo could have predicted just how beloved and lucrative the fluffy , white cub would become .
since his birth , tourists and camera crews have n't been able to get enough of the orphaned bear who had to be hand-raised and bottle-fed by zoo staff .
merchandise with the bear 's image , including - stamps , candies , and toys - has flown off the shelves .
in 2007 , knut brought in more than five million euros in extra revenue to the berlin zoo and neumuenster sued for a slice of the earnings .
however , judges urged berlin to buy the bear instead .
following an initial request of 700,000 euros for knut , berlin zoo officials said they were only willing to pay neumuenster 350,000 euros , “ the going rate for polar bears ” .
the final settlement of 430,000 euros means that berliners can now rest assured that the now three-year-old knut - the first polar bear to be born and raised there in over 30 years - will remain in the capital permanently. vj / afp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .
on thursday , the leaders of the major economies forum -lrb- mef - the g-8 plus brazil , china , india , mexico , south africa , australia , indonesia and south korea -rrb- are to meet in l 'aquila to discuss climate change .
the absence of chinese premier hu jintao , who returned home to deal with ethnic unrest in the country 's west , however , is likely to be a setback , and ahead of the meeting , developing countries resisted suggestions that they should endorse the 2050 goal .
asked whether a deal with china , india and other major developing economies would be reached on thursday , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said : " that is another question . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worldwide emissions cut could be difficult to achieve reinfeldt was present at the meeting as the current holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
light on details what specific measures might be taken to reach the carbon emissions goals , how the cuts will be financed , as well as when emissions would have to begin declining was not addressed in the statement .
" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .
" one year ago it was not possible -lrb- to agree to the two-degree limit -rrb- , our american partners did not accept that , now they accept it .
so there is progress , " european commission president jose manuel barroso told reporters .
other topics on the agenda for the remainder of the summit include the nuclear ambitions of north korea , the politically volatile situation in iran , and food security. mrh / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.07.2009 imf upbeat about economic growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf sees concerted effort to combat recession paying off the international monetary fund has raised its global economic growth forecast for 2010 to 2.5 percent , but says the recovery from recession will be sluggish . in its updated forecast , the world economic outlook , the imf said the world economy was beginning to stabilize and the recession would come to an end in the second half of this year .
the report marked the first time that the imf has sounded an optimistic note since the financial crisis struck last october .
" financial conditions have improved more than expected , " the report says , " owing mainly to public intervention , and recent data suggest that the rate of decline in economic activity is moderating , although to varying degrees among regions . "
the report , released on wednesday in time for the g-8 summit in italy , predicts that the world economy will shrink by 1.4 percent this year , but grow by 2.5 percent in 2010 .
this compares to a forecast in april of a 1.3 percent contraction in 2009 and growth of 1.9 percent next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf is hopeful that the world economy will soon be going in the other direction global recession not yet over the report went on to say , however , that " despite these positive signs , the global recession is not over , and the recovery is still expected to be slow , as financial systems remain impaired . "
the imf projected trade volume would plunge by 12.2 percent this year , a sharp 1.2 points more than forecast in its april weo .
trade would grow 1.0 percent next year , a gain of 0.4 percent from its prior forecast , it said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 08.07.2009 berlin city palace architect under fire as interior plans are revealed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the architect of the new city palace has come under fire after years of controversy , debate over berlin 's spreeinsel continues .
the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .
17 , 2010 . topics like migration , exchange and power are addressed with exhibits that feature everything from african masks to microscopes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world war two took a toll on the palace even after the clouds over stella 's eligibility have cleared , there promises to be further debate in the future over how the vision for the humboldt forum can best be implemented . for how long this question will occupy the city of berlin is anyone 's guess . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says there is evidence of a new willingness to work towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . in an interview with german public radio ard in rome , environment minister gabriel said the most important threshold countries had begun to wake up to their own climate responsibilities .
gabriel said that countries such as india and china had accepted that they , as well as industrialised nations , have to cut their greenhouse gas emissions .
the minister added that the 17 countries attending the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in rome had recognised the importance of not letting the average global temperature rise above two degrees celsius .
" these are two great results , " gabriel told the radio broadcaster .
" if we were to carry on as we have been until now , temperatures would rise by four , five or six degrees . "
and that , say scientists , could have catastrophic consequences , such as more heat waves , floods and droughts as well as the extinction of species .
room for greater improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such plumes of smoke are poison to the environment " we do n't have the choice between climate change and no climate change , " gabriel added .
" we have to decide between dangerous and controlable climate change . "
but the last-minute mef meeting , called to offer leaders a chance to agree a united front on climate change ahead of talks on the subject at the g-8 summit in l 'aquila , did not produce a timetable for implementation .
nor indeed , did the talks induce countries such as china and india to agree to a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
but gabriel said he was optimistic that further negotiations ahead of the 15th united nations climate conference at the end of the year , would yield the results the environment needs. tkw / dpa / reuters / ard editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .
on thursday , the leaders of the major economies forum -lrb- mef - the g-8 plus brazil , china , india , mexico , south africa , australia , indonesia and south korea -rrb- are to meet in l 'aquila to discuss climate change .
the absence of chinese premier hu jintao , who returned home to deal with ethnic unrest in the country 's west , however , is likely to be a setback , and ahead of the meeting , developing countries resisted suggestions that they should endorse the 2050 goal .

" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .

leaders need to agree on goals and financing for a deal at major climate talks in december . kim carstensen is the head of the world wide fund for nature 's global climate initiative .
the wwf and allianz recently released the g-8 climate scorecards 2009 , which rank g-8 members according to their improvements since 1990 , their current status and their policies for the future . deutsche welle : how important of a role do the g-8 countries play in the potential success of climate talks at the end of the year in copenhagen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major economies need to carry the heaviest burden , says carstensen kim carstensen : the level of commitment from developed countries needs to be carried by the biggest and strongest economies , and they are the g-8 countries .
without the g-8 countries coming together and committing to targets , committing to finances , committing to action on adaptation and on support for developing countries - if we do n't get the g-8 countries to come forward and commit to that then it 's going to be impossible to get a strong enough deal in copenhagen in december . looking at the current status of g-8 countries in the wwf report , japan and italy have earned some of the highest scores .
what are they doing that the other six nations are n't ? they have a situation where their actual emissions in italy are relatively low so they have a relatively high efficiency in their economy - so the status they have is relatively good .
but they are not very strong in terms of their action and policies for the future .
japan also has a relatively energy efficient economy and made some very good progress even before the kyoto protocol was established , and therefore its current status is still relatively good . when it comes to plans for the future , the top three g-8 countries - as far as climate change action is concerned - are germany , the united kingdom and france .
are they on target to stay that way ? looking at the policies for the future , none of these countries is actually doing enough to save the world from dangerous climate change and that is the real concern that this exercise shows .
we are not on track to really solve the problem even in the best cases of countries like germany , the uk and france .
even they do not do enough to live up to what they really need to do . if they do n't get competition from the other countries , everything is going to go wrong in terms of climate change .
if they do get competition , they are still not yet on track - and nobody is at the moment . click on the link in the audio section below to listen to the entire interview with kim carstensen , the head of the global climate initiative at wwf international . interview : mark mattox -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the architect chosen to rebuild the palace that once stood on the site is under fire and plans for the interior are anything but laid in stone . after nearly 20 years of debate over the construction of the city palace , the german government launched an architecture competition in 2007 to find a suitable design . the jury deliberated for a year before revealing the winning design , penned by the little-known italian architect francesco stella . winning architect accused of being ineligible only stella 's design adhered to the " stringent demands we made with this competition , " said wolfgang tiefensee , germany 's minister for transport and urban development .
particular praise was awarded to the inclusion of a spacious interior courtyard and the building 's seamless integration into the capital 's distinctive skyline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was long debate over the exterior of the palace ; now the interior is being considered but the realization of stella 's vision for the city palace may be in jeopardy . earlier this week , the berlin architect hans kollhoff lodged a formal protest with the german federal office for building and planning , claiming that stella " did not fulfill all the requirements necessary to participate in the competition . " kolhoff had been a contender himself , but only managed to secure a joint third place together with three other design studios .
the accusations arise from claims that , between 2004 and 2006 , stella did not earn the required minimum salary of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 419,000 -rrb- and did not employ three full-time employees in his studio , as stipulated in the contest rules . the italian architect denies these allegations .
this is no doubt an embarrassing revelation for the german government , which failed to check the eligibility of the competition 's participants beforehand . after initially expressing public doubt , hermann parzinger , president of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , stepped forward and threw his support behind stella . " franco stella understands the needs of the building 's future users very well , " he said . plans for the interior revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original city palace is pictured on a color postcard from before 1913 after long debate over the future use of berlin 's spreeinsel and much deliberation over the exterior plans , attention can finally be turned to the palace 's interior spaces . it is planned that the city palace facade will house the humboldt forum , envisaged as a center for culture , art , and science .
the " future users " of the building are slated to be the foundation of prussian cultural heritage , the humboldt university , and the berlin regional library .
representatives of the three organizations told reporters wednesday in berlin that the humboldt forum would offer nothing less than " a new view of the world . "
wednesday evening , german presdient horst koehler revealed plans of how the interior could look , opening a preliminary exhibition which runs through jan .
17 , 2010 . topics like migration , exchange and power are addressed with exhibits that feature everything from african masks to microscopes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city palace is seen here around the year 1900 parzinger described the concept as one of " mobility " and experimentation , reported the berliner morgenpost .
these principles apparently leave room for changes to the forum 's contents at any time - an approach that corresponds well to the path the city palace project has taken thus far .
a never-ending project ?
the plot of land on which the east german parliament once stood has been the subject of intense debate for more than two decades . after having been found to be contaminated by asbestos , the announcement of the building 's closure just prior to german reunification in 1990 raised a number of questions that would occupy the minds of berliners for many years . should the building be restored or demolished ? what would take its place and what form would the replacement take ? although these questions have been answered , new ones have already been risen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world war two took a toll on the palace even after the clouds over stella 's eligibility have cleared , there promises to be further debate in the future over how the vision for the humboldt forum can best be implemented . for how long this question will occupy the city of berlin is anyone 's guess . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report marked the first time that the imf has sounded an optimistic note since the financial crisis struck last october .
" financial conditions have improved more than expected , " the report says , " owing mainly to public intervention , and recent data suggest that the rate of decline in economic activity is moderating , although to varying degrees among regions . "
the report , released on wednesday in time for the g-8 summit in italy , predicts that the world economy will shrink by 1.4 percent this year , but grow by 2.5 percent in 2010 .
this compares to a forecast in april of a 1.3 percent contraction in 2009 and growth of 1.9 percent next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf is hopeful that the world economy will soon be going in the other direction global recession not yet over the report went on to say , however , that " despite these positive signs , the global recession is not over , and the recovery is still expected to be slow , as financial systems remain impaired . "
the imf projected trade volume would plunge by 12.2 percent this year , a sharp 1.2 points more than forecast in its april weo .
trade would grow 1.0 percent next year , a gain of 0.4 percent from its prior forecast , it said .
the imf urged policymakers to remain vigilant and supportive until growth resumes and deflationary risks recede .
it also said that concerns about rising government debt levels , as a result of higher government spending to shore up economies , highlight the need for stronger medium-term fiscal policy frameworks .
the imf stressed that the world 's economies now needed to begin thinking about rebuilding their financial balances to ensure that sustainable debt loads can be maintained after economic growth has been solidified. gb / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 08.07.2009 g-8 may discuss chinese skepticism over dollar as " world currency " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china thinks it 's time to reconsider the supremacy of the dollar china may not yet be a member of the g-8 group of leading industrial nations .
but it is expected to raise the most controversial issue of the current summit - whether the world should get away from the us dollar . most of the leaders at the summit would probably be content with emphasizing the fragile signs that the world economy is stabilizing .
but china may try to shift the focus to the dollar when it joins the proceedings as a guest .
china , which according to some estimates could be holding some 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion -lrb- 1.4 trillion euros -rrb- reserves in us dollars , has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks the world should take a cold hard look at the greenback as a global reference currency .
it is unclear what has motivated the remarks form beijing , but they could be an attempt to pressure washington into preventing inflation - which could benefit the us economy but damage china 's reserves .
another possibility , suggests friedrich heinemann , a financial expert at germany 's center for economic research , could be national vanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao will be attending the summit in italy " currency issues are always questions of prestige , " heinemann told dw-world.de.
" china may think that the financial crisis , which started in the us , means that america should no longer be the world 's unchallenged economic leader .
they may also feel their own currency is undervalued and that exchange rates do n't reflect recent global changes . "
but given china 's emphasis on dollars in its own reserves , beijing may be pursuing a risky strategy .
" it 's is a bit difficult to understand entirely , " heinemann said .
" china missed the opportunity to transfer resources into euros .
it 's baffling , especially as most people expect the us to recover . "
few open ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george washington ca n't believe his eyes in this cartoon bank note belief and expectations have played a huge role in the current economic crisis , and much of the politicians ' rhetoric about recovery is about restoring faith .
so the experts think it 's unlikely that western leaders will get behind the chinese initiative .
" it 's improbable , " said heinemann .
" the leaders have entirely different problems , and it would be impossible for them to send obama back home with the news that the dollar is going to be replaced as the world currency . "
in a statement last week , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty flatly dismissed the idea .
" in the midst of what is still a significant global recession , it 's important that we aim for stability , and stability has been based on the us dollar as the global currency , " flaherty told reporters .
china could use its influence to get the issue mentioned in the official statement coming out of the g-8 .
but reuters news agency quoted an unnamed official close to the g-8 as saying the wording of such a statement would be so watered down as to be " meaningless . "
and the g-8 , of course , has no official authority in this area .
" politicians ca n't decide to change the world currency , " heinemann said .
" investors do that when they decide which currency to conclude contracts and transactions in . "
pressure on the dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 will almost certainly back barack obama over beijing still , the mere idea of such a debate taking place is likely to affect global currency markets in the short term .
" there is caution that talks on the dollar as an international reserve currency would trigger dollar selling , " masato otsubo , a currency analyst at resona bank , told afp news agency .
other experts concur .
" the fact alone that heads of government could comment on the role of the dollar is putting pressure on the greenback , " said commerzbank analyst ulrich leuchtmann to afp , adding , though , that the pressure would likely disappear after the summit .
indeed , after china broached the topic last week , the dollar suffered slight falls against other major world currencies .
such fluctuations underscored the fact that the dollar has not been investors ' currency of choice in this economic slowdown , as it has been in past ones .
" the safe-haven appeal of the dollar has been undermined recently by increased concerns over accelerated reserve diversification , leaving it vulnerable in the week ahead to further comments around the sidelines at this week 's g-8 meeting questioning its role as a store of value , " bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj economist lee hardman told afp .
there is little to no chance that the dollar will lose its status as the world 's premier currency .
but if currency matters are always questions of prestige , it 's clear that america 's prestige has taken a dent .

they also agreed to new carbon emissions cut targets , pledging to cut emissions from within their borders by 80 percent by 2050 .
g-8 leaders also expressed hope that they would be able to convince rapidly developing nations to limit their own emissions , pitching in on an effort to cut worldwide emissions by 50 percent over that time .
" we have agreed for the first time -lsb- in the g-8 -rsb- that average global temperatures must rise by no more than two degrees … we hope that we will get that agreement tomorrow too , " british prime minister gordon brown said during a break in talks at the summit of g-8 leaders in the italian town of l 'aquila .
on thursday , the leaders of the major economies forum -lrb- mef - the g-8 plus brazil , china , india , mexico , south africa , australia , indonesia and south korea -rrb- are to meet in l 'aquila to discuss climate change .
the absence of chinese premier hu jintao , who returned home to deal with ethnic unrest in the country 's west , however , is likely to be a setback , and ahead of the meeting , developing countries resisted suggestions that they should endorse the 2050 goal .
asked whether a deal with china , india and other major developing economies would be reached on thursday , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said : " that is another question . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worldwide emissions cut could be difficult to achieve reinfeldt was present at the meeting as the current holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
light on details what specific measures might be taken to reach the carbon emissions goals , how the cuts will be financed , as well as when emissions would have to begin declining was not addressed in the statement .
" we recognize the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees , " the meeting 's final draft stated .
that is in line with scientific warnings that if the world 's average temperature rises by more than two degrees , it will cause catastrophic changes to world weather patterns , triggering widespread storms , flooding , droughts and famines .
last year , g-8 leaders called for world emissions to fall by 50 per cent by 2050 , but failed to endorse the two-degree goal .
" one year ago it was not possible -lrb- to agree to the two-degree limit -rrb- , our american partners did not accept that , now they accept it .

analysts and industry watchers said the power of the web was displayed in its ability to let people interact , share and also produce content on the day .
global web traffic was as high as 33 % above normal during the event at the staples centre in los angeles .
" the web lets us connect and see the story from multiple views unlike tv , " said mashable 's ben parr .
" this is more than a turning point .
it 's about giving users more than one view as well as opportunities to not only be a consumer but a producer .
" i have seen people with their iphone 3gs 's recording video from inside the staples center and sharing it with the world , " said mr parr who is an associate editor with mashable , the world 's largest blog focusing on social media .
mr parr said he believed this service would turn out to be one of the biggest events on the web .
akamai , which delivers more than 20 % of the world 's internet traffic , said it was the second-largest day on its network .
the company reported nearly four million visitors per minute as of 10am pacific time , around the time the ceremony started at the staples centre .
the biggest day was on 25 june when news of michael jackson 's death first hit the web .
over 4.2 million global visitors per minute visited news sites that day .
" mass experience " at facebook , the world 's biggest social networking site , a total of about one million users posted around 800,000 status updates related to online broadcasts hosted by cnn , e !
online , abc and mtv .
the company said that even though there were 1.8 million updates with the word " obama " during the president 's inauguration , that event was known about and planned for months in advance .
" the site has become a central place to view the news about michael jackson and share in a tribute to his life and the mourning of his death , " said facebook 's elizabeth linder .
ustream said the memorial was the " largest ever " event hosted by the site .
it served 4.6 million video streams from around the world in partnership with cbs .
viewers taking part in the chat rooms left over 12,000 messages per minute .
on the bbc traffic also increased but not to a record setting amount .
the corporation 's gareth owen said " while more users than normal tuned into the bbc 's live coverage on the web , it was about a third of the traffic that tuned in the day after michael jackson died . "
yahoo said the ceremony was the single most streamed in its history with 5 million total streams .
" i thought the first screen became the second screen and the web won out over tv , " said mark ghuneim , founder of trendrr which tracks and reports on social and digital media .
" the immediacy of the live web and its ability to let people collaborate and share was better than watching it on the tube .
the tv showed itself as a much more isolated experience .
" michael jackson had the effect of bringing people together and it was another of those mass experiences that acted in the same way as the presidential inauguration but in order of magnitude world-wide .
this was a great day for the real live web , " said mr ghuneim .
but not everyone agrees that it was a slam dunk for the internet .
" the web gets bragging rights for having broken the story of michael jackson 's death on the tmz entertainment site , " said professor robert thompson , the director of the center for popular television at syracuse university .
" i do n't know of any internet or website that was actually there with their cameras covering the staples event .
you might have watched on the web but the pictures were still coming through the traditional pipes provided by television . "
performance throughout the star studded ceremony , a host of firms kept track of how well the web performed in the spotlight and under pressure from the tens of millions of people tuning in to watch online .
" in general the internet held up very nicely , " said imad mouline the chief technology officer for gomez inc , a website performance measuring company .
" there were no major issues and fortunately we did not see any huge impact across the board as far as the internet was concerned .
there was some slowing and rebuffering of internet feeds and some news sites took longer to load their homes pages , " mr mouline told the bbc .
while the company would not name the seven news sites it monitored , it said that the time it took for a site to load its home page had slowed .
response times ranged from 6.5 seconds to 18.5 seconds compared to a normal span of 3.5 seconds to 7.3 seconds .
keynote system said it also saw some slowing down but that overall the internet performed well .
on the day that michael jackson died the web was overwhelmed as fans and well-wishers rushed for information and confirmation of his passing .
at one point google news thought it was under attack and put out an error messaging that warned users " your query looks similar to automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application " .
" over-covered " not everyone has been impressed by the floods of attention and headlines devoted to the michael jackson story .
a pew research center poll published last week found that 64 % of those surveyed said jackson 's death has received too much coverage .
" i would say this have been over-covered , " agreed professor thompson from syracuse university .
" it was an important story but it was a cultural story .
michael jackson was a force and influence in the late 20th century .
" i do n't think there would be that many people , including myself , who would say this deserved to be covered in a way that knocked every other story off the screen here in the united states , " professor thompson told bbc news .

analysts and industry watchers said the power of the web was displayed in its ability to let people interact , share and also produce content on the day .
global web traffic was as high as 33 % above normal during the event at the staples centre in los angeles .
" the web lets us connect and see the story from multiple views unlike tv , " said mashable 's ben parr .
" this is more than a turning point .
it 's about giving users more than one view as well as opportunities to not only be a consumer but a producer .
" i have seen people with their iphone 3gs 's recording video from inside the staples center and sharing it with the world , " said mr parr who is an associate editor with mashable , the world 's largest blog focusing on social media .
mr parr said he believed this service would turn out to be one of the biggest events on the web .
akamai , which delivers more than 20 % of the world 's internet traffic , said it was the second-largest day on its network .
the company reported nearly four million visitors per minute as of 10am pacific time , around the time the ceremony started at the staples centre .
the biggest day was on 25 june when news of michael jackson 's death first hit the web .
over 4.2 million global visitors per minute visited news sites that day .
" mass experience " at facebook , the world 's biggest social networking site , a total of about one million users posted around 800,000 status updates related to online broadcasts hosted by cnn , e !
online , abc and mtv .
jackson is officially facebook 's most popular person with 7 + million fans the company said that even though there were 1.8 million updates with the word " obama " during the president 's inauguration , that event was known about and planned for months in advance .
" the site has become a central place to view the news about michael jackson and share in a tribute to his life and the mourning of his death , " said facebook 's elizabeth linder .
ustream said the memorial was the " largest ever " event hosted by the site .
it served 4.6 million video streams from around the world in partnership with cbs .
viewers taking part in the chat rooms left over 12,000 messages per minute .
on the bbc traffic also increased but not to a record setting amount .
the corporation 's gareth owen said " while more users than normal tuned into the bbc 's live coverage on the web , it was about a third of the traffic that tuned in the day after michael jackson died . "
yahoo said the ceremony was the single most streamed in its history with 5 million total streams .
" i thought the first screen became the second screen and the web won out over tv , " said mark ghuneim , founder of trendrr which tracks and reports on social and digital media .
" the immediacy of the live web and its ability to let people collaborate and share was better than watching it on the tube .
the tv showed itself as a much more isolated experience .
" michael jackson had the effect of bringing people together and it was another of those mass experiences that acted in the same way as the presidential inauguration but in order of magnitude world-wide .
this was a great day for the real live web , " said mr ghuneim .
but not everyone agrees that it was a slam dunk for the internet .
" the web gets bragging rights for having broken the story of michael jackson 's death on the tmz entertainment site , " said professor robert thompson , the director of the center for popular television at syracuse university .
" i do n't know of any internet or website that was actually there with their cameras covering the staples event .
you might have watched on the web but the pictures were still coming through the traditional pipes provided by television . "
performance throughout the star studded ceremony , a host of firms kept track of how well the web performed in the spotlight and under pressure from the tens of millions of people tuning in to watch online .
" in general the internet held up very nicely , " said imad mouline the chief technology officer for gomez inc , a website performance measuring company .
google thought it was under attack on the day jackson died " there were no major issues and fortunately we did not see any huge impact across the board as far as the internet was concerned .
there was some slowing and rebuffering of internet feeds and some news sites took longer to load their homes pages , " mr mouline told the bbc .
while the company would not name the seven news sites it monitored , it said that the time it took for a site to load its home page had slowed .
response times ranged from 6.5 seconds to 18.5 seconds compared to a normal span of 3.5 seconds to 7.3 seconds .
keynote system said it also saw some slowing down but that overall the internet performed well .
on the day that michael jackson died the web was overwhelmed as fans and well-wishers rushed for information and confirmation of his passing .
at one point google news thought it was under attack and put out an error messaging that warned users " your query looks similar to automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application " .
" over-covered " not everyone has been impressed by the floods of attention and headlines devoted to the michael jackson story .
a pew research center poll published last week found that 64 % of those surveyed said jackson 's death has received too much coverage .
michael jackson 's memorial could top a worldwide audience of over 1 billion " i would say this have been over-covered , " agreed professor thompson from syracuse university .
" it was an important story but it was a cultural story .
michael jackson was a force and influence in the late 20th century .
" i do n't think there would be that many people , including myself , who would say this deserved to be covered in a way that knocked every other story off the screen here in the united states , " professor thompson told bbc news .

architen landrell in chepstow , monmouthshire , were approached by the main architects only a few months ago to provide the fabric elements .
the irish band kicked off the european stage of their 31-city tour in barcelona last month .
the designers had to make three stages to be used in rotation - one live , one being dismantled and one being set up .
the stage was a collaboration between the lead architects mark fisher studio , structural engineers atelier one and steel company stage co as well as architen landrell , which has had a base in chepstow for the past 20 years .
architen landrell made the green pvc fabric which covers the structure , an estimated 1,500 sq m in total for each stage .
teams of employees from the 45-strong staff were flown to barcelona for the first two shows last month to set up the stage and to provide guidance and assistance while the shows ran .
each stage will be assembled and dismantled 45 times kate cox , project manager from architen landrell for the stage , told the bbc wales news website : " this is just by far one of the largest staging structures , if not the largest , ever to be put together .
" we 've worked with rock and pop a lot over the years and it 's working with the same people who say , ' oh yeah i remember the stones in ' 89 ' or whatever .
" with rock and pop , everything happens really fast so it 's quite exciting and exhilarating .
" we were approached in early spring to do the fabric for it .
it 's a very fast-track project and there were so many aspects - from a staging perspective it 's awesome , from a trucking perspective it 's awesome .
" because of the way it tours , there are three stage sets so they sort of hopscotch each other .
one will be playing , one will be being dismantled and a third will be being transported and erected . "
ms cox explained the fabric was a blackout fabric so the steelwork underneath would be concealed .
" the outer is a very light green colour chosen by the band .
it 's just not white and not green .
i think it was mostly for lighting - it 's close enough to white so it does n't interfere with it . "
ms cox has never seen u2 in concert but hopes to see the finished product in action in the uk , with the british leg concluding in the millennium stadium in cardiff on 22 august .
it then moves on to north america .

architen landrell in chepstow , monmouthshire , were approached by the main architects only a few months ago to provide the fabric elements .
the irish band kicked off the european stage of their 31-city tour in barcelona last month .
the designers had to make three stages to be used in rotation - one live , one being dismantled and one being set up .
the stage was a collaboration between the lead architects mark fisher studio , structural engineers atelier one and steel company stage co as well as architen landrell , which has had a base in chepstow for the past 20 years .
architen landrell made the green pvc fabric which covers the structure , an estimated 1,500 sq m in total for each stage .
teams of employees from the 45-strong staff were flown to barcelona for the first two shows last month to set up the stage and to provide guidance and assistance while the shows ran .
each stage will be assembled and dismantled 45 times kate cox , project manager from architen landrell for the stage , told the bbc wales news website : " this is just by far one of the largest staging structures , if not the largest , ever to be put together .
" we 've worked with rock and pop a lot over the years and it 's working with the same people who say , ' oh yeah i remember the stones in ' 89 ' or whatever .
" with rock and pop , everything happens really fast so it 's quite exciting and exhilarating .
" we were approached in early spring to do the fabric for it .
it 's a very fast-track project and there were so many aspects - from a staging perspective it 's awesome , from a trucking perspective it 's awesome .
" because of the way it tours , there are three stage sets so they sort of hopscotch each other .
one will be playing , one will be being dismantled and a third will be being transported and erected . "
ms cox explained the fabric was a blackout fabric so the steelwork underneath would be concealed .
" the outer is a very light green colour chosen by the band .
it 's just not white and not green .
i think it was mostly for lighting - it 's close enough to white so it does n't interfere with it . "
ms cox has never seen u2 in concert but hopes to see the finished product in action in the uk , with the british leg concluding in the millennium stadium in cardiff on 22 august .

john naylor spent £ 275,000 developing leighton park model farm in 1849 and the rest of his estate near welshpool .
but in the early part of the 20th century it was broken up to pay for death duties and in 1931 the farm was sold to the local authority .
it needs repairs , but owners powys council said they could cost £ 2m .
the council said last year it could not afford the long-term renovation costs .
the leighton park estate was given to john naylor by his uncle as a wedding present .
keeping pace between 1848 and 1856 he invested about £ 275,000 in it .
more than 150 years on , the farm has nine tenant farmers who share 473 acres .
an area called leighton centre , which is also owned by the council , has eight commercial and two residential tenants .
but the farm estate 's age is catching up with it and during the last few years it has fallen into disrepair .
in a report in july 2008 , powys council said it had spent more than £ 150,000 in maintenance costs since 2003 , but that was not keeping pace with the " buildings ' rate of deterioration " .
a council survey a few years ago found it would cost £ 2m to bring the property up to scratch .
the prince 's regeneration trust has tried to find possible uses for the farm , and in 2007 prince charles visited the farm and leighton centre .
the 2008 council report highlighted the importance of the farm and the surrounding buildings .
it said : " the leighton centre includes 16 separately listed grade ii -lrb- star -rrb- buildings and seven separately listed grade ii buildings .
" a concentration of so many grade ii -lrb- star -rrb- farm buildings is extremely unusual and indicative of the significance of leighton .
" leighton centre therefore represents a heritage asset of the greatest importance nationally , however , therein lies the problems for the county council who as landlord have the responsibility for their upkeep . "
the report added : " a recent condition survey identified the need to spend up to £ 2m to bring them up to a satisfactory condition and addresses dry rot and poor roofs .
" it is considered that the council is not in a position to spend large sums of money on the up keep of leighton centre and over recent years alternative uses and possible ownerships have been sought to no avail . "

john naylor spent £ 275,000 developing leighton park model farm in 1849 and the rest of his estate near welshpool .
but in the early part of the 20th century it was broken up to pay for death duties and in 1931 the farm was sold to the local authority .
it needs repairs , but owners powys council said they could cost £ 2m .
the council said last year it could not afford the long-term renovation costs .
the leighton park estate was given to john naylor by his uncle as a wedding present .
keeping pace between 1848 and 1856 he invested about £ 275,000 in it .
more than 150 years on , the farm has nine tenant farmers who share 473 acres .
an area called leighton centre , which is also owned by the council , has eight commercial and two residential tenants .
but the farm estate 's age is catching up with it and during the last few years it has fallen into disrepair .
in a report in july 2008 , powys council said it had spent more than £ 150,000 in maintenance costs since 2003 , but that was not keeping pace with the " buildings ' rate of deterioration " .
a council survey a few years ago found it would cost £ 2m to bring the property up to scratch .
the prince 's regeneration trust has tried to find possible uses for the farm , and in 2007 prince charles visited the farm and leighton centre .
the 2008 council report highlighted the importance of the farm and the surrounding buildings .
it said : " the leighton centre includes 16 separately listed grade ii -lrb- star -rrb- buildings and seven separately listed grade ii buildings .
" a concentration of so many grade ii -lrb- star -rrb- farm buildings is extremely unusual and indicative of the significance of leighton .
" leighton centre therefore represents a heritage asset of the greatest importance nationally , however , therein lies the problems for the county council who as landlord have the responsibility for their upkeep . "
the report added : " a recent condition survey identified the need to spend up to £ 2m to bring them up to a satisfactory condition and addresses dry rot and poor roofs .
" it is considered that the council is not in a position to spend large sums of money on the up keep of leighton centre and over recent years alternative uses and possible ownerships have been sought to no avail . "

' management sulking ' he added : " it 's now clear that royal mail management is the biggest block to modernisation .
" management seem to be sulking because the prospect of privatisation and increased executive pay has disappeared .
