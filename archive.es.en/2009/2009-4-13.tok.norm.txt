according to iran 's isna news agency , jalili , who is a top official at iran 's supreme national security council , spoke to solana on the telephone .
isna on monday quoted jalili as saying that tehran would soon declare its official stance on the matter .
in brussels , a spokeswoman for solana confirmed that he and jalili " had a constructive conversation , " and " agreed to remain in contact . "
last wednesday , the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , britain , russia , china , and france - together with germany tasked solana with inviting iran to discuss its nuclear program .
the west suspects tehran is secretly making atomic weapons and has repeatedly called on the country to stop its uranium enrichment program .
iran says its nuclear program is designed purely for generating electricity .
a new beginning on the persian new year day , us president barack obama advocated a " new beginning " in the relationship between the arch-foes , marking a major shift in us policy under the new administration .
while inaugurating iran 's first nuclear fuel plant last week , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said the islamic republic would be ready for talks with the west if they were based on respect and justice .
in washington , state department spokesman robert wood repeated the us offer to hold talks with iran without any preconditions , but said iran needed to show the international community that its nuclear program is a peaceful one .
“ right now , the international community is very skeptical about that , " wood said. db / nw / nk , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his comments have caused outraged among german atheist organizations . " without god , everything is permitted . "
with this famous quote from russian writer fyodor dostoyevsky , the bishop of the southern bavarian town of augsburg wanted to warn his congregation of what he sees as the dangers of atheism .
bishop mixa told churchgoers that a society without god was " hell on earth " and could result in bloody regimes such as those led by adolf hitler or the soviet union .
" decades past have proven the inhumanity of atheism through the godless regimes of national socialism and communism , with their penal camps , secret police and mass murder , " he said .
" wherever god is denied or fought against , there , humans and their dignity will also be denied and violated , " he added .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six million jews are believed to have died during wwii ladwig told german news magazine spiegel that mixa 's comments were part of a long-running strategy by the church to incorrectly rewrite its own historical dealings with fascism .

bishop mixa was also criticized by michael schmidt-salomon from the giordano bruno foundation , a german organization in support of evolutionary humanism .
schmidt-salomon told spiegel the argument that national socialism was godless was a " grand falsification . "
" evidence shows that the majority of the nazi elite considered themselves christian , " schmidt-salomon said .
a history of controversial comments bishop mixa is known in germany as being outspoken and has ruffled feathers on more than one occasion .
in just one example in february , mixa compared the number of jews murdered by the nazis to the number of abortions over the past few decades .
he also upset politicians two years ago when he criticized government plans to expand childcare facilities in germany .

about half of the documents have been pulled from the rubble , but now more work must be done to preserve the material . for the past several weeks , more than 60 firemen and volunteers have been spending most of their days at the site where the archive once stood .
with scoops , cranes and even their bare hands , they search through the rubble not for bodies , but for paper . that is because the documented history of the entire region now lays buried under 60 tons of rock and other debris . " today we just found a document from the 11th century , " said cologne fireman thomas buergermann .
" this is what we are doing , looking and searching for archival material , 12 hours a day every day , with the exception of sunday . " since the collapse of the archive building on march 3 , workers have been present at the site .
they plan to stay until the last document has been uncovered . " we 'll do this job until the last historical items have been found , said johannes feirer , cologne 's deputy fire chief .

bildunterschrift : workers and volunteers have been at the site non-stop a " safe haven " for uncovered documents the archive materials are being brought to a furniture warehouse located about 20 kilometers outside of cologne .
as soon as the firemen find something they believe to be of significance , they record exactly where in the rubble they found the item , pack it in a box , and ship it to the furniture warehouse in porz , one of the city 's suburbs . in the long halls of the warehouse , there are hundreds of boxes full of random parchments , scrolls , papers , and books .
some are clean and dry , others dirty and wet .
dressed in white plastic suits and wearing hoods and protective masks , archivists , restorers , and volunteers from the rhineland and beyond have come here to begin the mindboggling task of preserving and organizing the recovered materials . the archivists and restorers are especially concerned with water-damaged documents .
for once the document begins to mold , the chance of preserving it is next to none .
archivists use dry ice to freeze documents before they can begin the long process of being restored . documents that were exposed to water while buried under the rubble must remain frozen for months before being dried .
this is the only way to prevent mold from forming . max plassman , one of four main archivists responsible for the preservation of the recovered documents , said this process would be unthinkable without the help of volunteers . " we have to stress the fact that most of the work here is done by volunteers , " he said .

it 's unbelievable . " crucial to the rhineland the efforts to preserve the documents of cologne 's archive are really efforts to preserve cologne 's history , which dates back to the roman empire . for the historians of the rhineland , the archive collapse is especially devastating .

franz muentefering , chairman of the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- party which shares power with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the chancellor would have to consider taking a stake in opel if other rescue efforts failed .
in an interview with bild am sonntag newspaper , muentefering said there were 25,000 jobs at stake and the company was too important to simply let it fail if no investor was found .

according to the new york times , the us government has ordered gm to file for bankruptcy by june 1 .
the idea is to effectuate a " surgical bankruptcy , " which would divide gm 's " good " assets from its unhealthy ones .
muentefering says too many jobs at stake the new york times report was based on unnamed sources .

in berlin , a political battle is being waged over whether or not the state will step in and take a stake in opel to help it through the tough times .
franz muentefering , chairman of the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- party which shares power with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the chancellor would have to consider taking a stake in opel if other rescue efforts failed .
in an interview with bild am sonntag newspaper , muentefering said there were 25,000 jobs at stake and the company was too important to simply let it fail if no investor was found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering says the state may have to step in for opel " frau merkel will not be able to continue refusing state participation in opel if that turns out to be the only way to rescue opel , " said muentefering , who added that he and his party also would prefer a private investor taking a stake in opel .
" there are too many jobs on the line , " said muentefering .
the spd chairman also pointed out that leaders of four german states where opel plants are based have also signalled that a government rescue can not be ruled out .
they include three cdu state premiers - roland koch of hesse , juergen ruettgers of north rhine-westphalia and dieter althaus of thuringia - as well as spd state premier kurt beck in rhineland-palatinate .
but angela merkel 's chief of staff , thomas de maiziere , once again denied that the state would be taking over all or part of opel .

over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .

a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .

last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .

but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .
“ we 're from the generation that has known war , ” one older woman said .
“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .

the government said the deaths occurred when red-clad demonstrators clashed with local residents , who had armed themselves and set up roadblocks to counter the protesters near government house , the seat of thai government .
elsewhere , anti-government protesters clashed with security forces , leaving over 20 troops injured , and set fire to a government ministry with molotov cocktails . making it clear they were prepared for a " final stand , " the so-called red shirt protesters later retreated to their camp near the offices of prime minister abhisit , just one day after the embattled premier imposed a state of emergency in the capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have used live munition to disperse protesters abhisit warns protesters " those who want to help the government restore normality can return home , " abhisit said in a televised address .

the taliban have carried out similar assassinations in kandahar in recent years .

officials said scores of people were wounded as troops enforcing a state of emergency clashed with protesters . police estimated that up to 30,000 red-shirted anti-government protesters had gathered around the capital , bangkok , on sunday . in a telephone address to protesters gathered outside the prime minister 's offices , thaksin attacked the government 's response to the demonstrations , and held out the possibility of returning to thailand to lead the protesters ' movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaksin is wanted in thailand on corruption charges " now that they have tanks on the streets , it is time for the people to come out in revolution , " he said .
" and when it is necessary , i will come back to the country .
let us be strong to fight for true democracy for our people . " thaksin , who has been living in exile since a coup forced him from power in 2006 , said the protests were a " golden opportunity " to dislodge the current government , which he described as illegitimate . he also thanked soldiers who refused to enforce the government 's emergency measures and urged the military to join the so-called " red shirt " movement to oust prime minister abhisit vejjajiva . " the troops who have already come out can come and join the red shirts to help us to get democracy for the people , " he said . state of emergency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors want to see the current prime minister gone earlier , the thai government declared a state of emergency in bangkok and surrounding areas after protesters forced the cancellation of an association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- summit on saturday . the announcement came as hundreds of protesters stormed the interior ministry , demanding premier abhisit vejjajiva 's resigantion .
abhisit managed to escape the complex by car after soldiers guarding him fired shots in the air to keep demonstrators at bay .
in a tv address , abhisit said the nation was " in danger " because of unreasonable , self-serving people .
government officials said soldiers and armored vehicles had been deployed to secure public buildings , intersections and public transportation at 50 locations throughout the city .
authorities did not say how long the state of emergency would be in force , but abhisit said the next three to four days would be " crucial to returning to peace . "
the measure bans public gatherings of more than five people and allows security forces to detain suspects for up to 30 days without charge .
officials can also enforce strict controls on media and all other forms of communication .
this is the third time a state of emergency has been called in the capital since september 2008 .
thai police arrest protest leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protest leader arisman pongreungrong may be feeling less victorious after his arrest the interior ministry was stormed after thai police arrested the leader of saturday 's anti-government protests .
arisman pongruengrong 's arrest came as the prime minister promised to take legal action against thaksin 's supporters .
in his weekly televised address to the nation , abhisit described the protesters as " enemies of thailand " and vowed to bring order and peace back to the divided country .
ongoing uncertainty thaksin 's supporters are demanding abhisit 's resignation and new elections just four months after he took office .
abhisit was installed as prime minister in a parliamentary vote after a court ruling removed thaksin 's allies from power in response to anti-thaksin protesters occupying two thai airports for a week .
four prime ministers over the last 15 months have failed in their attempts to stabilize the country and saturday 's dramatic evacuation of foreign leaders from the asean summit venue by helicopter is another embarrassment for the thai government .
ahead of the summit , the thai government had given assurances that it would take whatever measures necessary to prevent such a situation .
officials have now acknowledged that security forces had failed to do just that .
missed opportunities at cancelled summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao was meant to announce a multi-billion dollar investment fund at the summit the summit was meant to bring together southeast asian leaders with ministers from china , south korea , japan , india , australia and new zealand and un secretary general ban ki-moon to discuss the global financial crisis and north korea 's recent rocket launch .
asian leaders were also expected to sign an investment pact with china .
china has announced an offer of $ 15 billion in credit to asean countries and a $ 10 billion infrastructure investment fund .
the asean meeting had already been delayed by previous clashes between anti-government and pro-government supporters .
thai officials now say talks will be held in about two months ' time . sje / pfd / tt , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said scores of people were wounded as troops enforcing a state of emergency clashed with protesters . police estimated that up to 30,000 red-shirted anti-government protesters had gathered around the capital , bangkok , on sunday . in a telephone address to protesters gathered outside the prime minister 's offices , thaksin attacked the government 's response to the demonstrations , and held out the possibility of returning to thailand to lead the protesters ' movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaksin is wanted in thailand on corruption charges " now that they have tanks on the streets , it is time for the people to come out in revolution , " he said .
" and when it is necessary , i will come back to the country .
let us be strong to fight for true democracy for our people . " thaksin , who has been living in exile since a coup forced him from power in 2006 , said the protests were a " golden opportunity " to dislodge the current government , which he described as illegitimate . he also thanked soldiers who refused to enforce the government 's emergency measures and urged the military to join the so-called " red shirt " movement to oust prime minister abhisit vejjajiva . " the troops who have already come out can come and join the red shirts to help us to get democracy for the people , " he said . state of emergency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors want to see the current prime minister gone earlier , the thai government declared a state of emergency in bangkok and surrounding areas after protesters forced the cancellation of an association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- summit on saturday . the announcement came as hundreds of protesters stormed the interior ministry , demanding premier abhisit vejjajiva 's resigantion .
abhisit managed to escape the complex by car after soldiers guarding him fired shots in the air to keep demonstrators at bay .
in a tv address , abhisit said the nation was " in danger " because of unreasonable , self-serving people .
government officials said soldiers and armored vehicles had been deployed to secure public buildings , intersections and public transportation at 50 locations throughout the city .
authorities did not say how long the state of emergency would be in force , but abhisit said the next three to four days would be " crucial to returning to peace . "
the measure bans public gatherings of more than five people and allows security forces to detain suspects for up to 30 days without charge .
officials can also enforce strict controls on media and all other forms of communication .
this is the third time a state of emergency has been called in the capital since september 2008 .
thai police arrest protest leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protest leader arisman pongreungrong may be feeling less victorious after his arrest the interior ministry was stormed after thai police arrested the leader of saturday 's anti-government protests .
arisman pongruengrong 's arrest came as the prime minister promised to take legal action against thaksin 's supporters .
in his weekly televised address to the nation , abhisit described the protesters as " enemies of thailand " and vowed to bring order and peace back to the divided country .
ongoing uncertainty thaksin 's supporters are demanding abhisit 's resignation and new elections just four months after he took office .
abhisit was installed as prime minister in a parliamentary vote after a court ruling removed thaksin 's allies from power in response to anti-thaksin protesters occupying two thai airports for a week .
four prime ministers over the last 15 months have failed in their attempts to stabilize the country and saturday 's dramatic evacuation of foreign leaders from the asean summit venue by helicopter is another embarrassment for the thai government .
ahead of the summit , the thai government had given assurances that it would take whatever measures necessary to prevent such a situation .
officials have now acknowledged that security forces had failed to do just that .
missed opportunities at cancelled summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao was meant to announce a multi-billion dollar investment fund at the summit the summit was meant to bring together southeast asian leaders with ministers from china , south korea , japan , india , australia and new zealand and un secretary general ban ki-moon to discuss the global financial crisis and north korea 's recent rocket launch .
asian leaders were also expected to sign an investment pact with china .
china has announced an offer of $ 15 billion in credit to asean countries and a $ 10 billion infrastructure investment fund .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.04.2009 easter marches march on ... or is that limping ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those rainbows stand for peace leaders of germany ’ s peace movement were talking up the positives from this year ’ s more than 70 easter marches nationwide .
but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .
“ we 're from the generation that has known war , ” one older woman said .
“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .
the german easter march movement , which began as an echo of an anti-nuclear march led by bertrand russell in london , started in 1960 , meaning the 2010 marching season will be the movement 's 50th . mrh / jen , dpa / epd / wdr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

achikzai and her husband , a doctor and university lecturer , had returned from exile to work in the southern afghan city of kandahar , leaving their son and daughter in germany .
the taliban have carried out similar assassinations in kandahar in recent years .
last year they admitted to murdering the country 's highest profile female police officer , and they are believed to have been behind the 2006 assassination of the head of the provincial women 's affairs department .
two years ago , zarghona kakar , another woman on the kandahar provincial council , survived a taliban assassination attempt in which her husband was killed .
taliban members also sprayed acid into the faces of schoolgirls in kandahar in november last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.04.2009 easter marches march on ... or is that limping ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those rainbows stand for peace leaders of germany ’ s peace movement were talking up the positives from this year ’ s more than 70 easter marches nationwide .
but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .
“ we 're from the generation that has known war , ” one older woman said .
“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .
the german easter march movement , which began as an echo of an anti-nuclear march led by bertrand russell in london , started in 1960 , meaning the 2010 marching season will be the movement 's 50th . mrh / jen , dpa / epd / wdr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about half of the documents have been pulled from the rubble , but now more work must be done to preserve the material . for the past several weeks , more than 60 firemen and volunteers have been spending most of their days at the site where the archive once stood .
with scoops , cranes and even their bare hands , they search through the rubble not for bodies , but for paper . that is because the documented history of the entire region now lays buried under 60 tons of rock and other debris . " today we just found a document from the 11th century , " said cologne fireman thomas buergermann .
" this is what we are doing , looking and searching for archival material , 12 hours a day every day , with the exception of sunday . " since the collapse of the archive building on march 3 , workers have been present at the site .
they plan to stay until the last document has been uncovered . " we 'll do this job until the last historical items have been found , said johannes feirer , cologne 's deputy fire chief .
" i think that we have already recovered more than half of the historical materials , " he said .
bildunterschrift : workers and volunteers have been at the site non-stop a " safe haven " for uncovered documents the archive materials are being brought to a furniture warehouse located about 20 kilometers outside of cologne .
as soon as the firemen find something they believe to be of significance , they record exactly where in the rubble they found the item , pack it in a box , and ship it to the furniture warehouse in porz , one of the city 's suburbs . in the long halls of the warehouse , there are hundreds of boxes full of random parchments , scrolls , papers , and books .
some are clean and dry , others dirty and wet .
dressed in white plastic suits and wearing hoods and protective masks , archivists , restorers , and volunteers from the rhineland and beyond have come here to begin the mindboggling task of preserving and organizing the recovered materials . the archivists and restorers are especially concerned with water-damaged documents .
for once the document begins to mold , the chance of preserving it is next to none .
archivists use dry ice to freeze documents before they can begin the long process of being restored . documents that were exposed to water while buried under the rubble must remain frozen for months before being dried .
this is the only way to prevent mold from forming . max plassman , one of four main archivists responsible for the preservation of the recovered documents , said this process would be unthinkable without the help of volunteers . " we have to stress the fact that most of the work here is done by volunteers , " he said .
" it is a very important fact for us , because we could n't handle this process on our own .
they are turning up daily by the hundreds here .
it 's unbelievable . " crucial to the rhineland the efforts to preserve the documents of cologne 's archive are really efforts to preserve cologne 's history , which dates back to the roman empire . for the historians of the rhineland , the archive collapse is especially devastating .
for the region 's universities , the preservation of recovered documents is absolutely critical . " you have to understand that the history of our region , the rhineland , is influenced very much by cologne , which was and is the largest city in the area , " said andreas rutz , an assistant professor of history at the university of bonn . " we have a number of phd students working on cologne subjects .
they 're writing their dissertations on the history of cologne .
for them above all it 's a big catastrophe .
they have no chance of actually finishing their dissertations the way they planned to .
so for them it would be great , if these things were found .
because then they would be able to continue . " author : gabriel borrud editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about half of the documents have been pulled from the rubble , but now more work must be done to preserve the material . for the past several weeks , more than 60 firemen and volunteers have been spending most of their days at the site where the archive once stood .
with scoops , cranes and even their bare hands , they search through the rubble not for bodies , but for paper . that is because the documented history of the entire region now lays buried under 60 tons of rock and other debris . " today we just found a document from the 11th century , " said cologne fireman thomas buergermann .
" this is what we are doing , looking and searching for archival material , 12 hours a day every day , with the exception of sunday . " since the collapse of the archive building on march 3 , workers have been present at the site .
they plan to stay until the last document has been uncovered . " we 'll do this job until the last historical items have been found , said johannes feirer , cologne 's deputy fire chief .
" i think that we have already recovered more than half of the historical materials , " he said .
bildunterschrift : workers and volunteers have been at the site non-stop a " safe haven " for uncovered documents the archive materials are being brought to a furniture warehouse located about 20 kilometers outside of cologne .

the goal now : saving face . bayern munich president franz beckenbauer described the first half of the game in barcelona , when lionel messi scored twice and thierry henry and samuel eto 'o also got on the scoresheet , as the worst half of football he had ever seen played by a bayern team .
there were calls in some quarters for the dismissal of coach jurgen klinsmann but the pressure on the former germany boss has abated somewhat in the wake of a 4-0 demolition of eintracht frankfurt in the bundesliga at the weekend .
on tuesday , the team will be playing mostly for pride .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said the first leg was the worst he had ever seen " we are not going to beat them by four goals , that 's clear to us , " said klinsmann .
" however , we will show that we have integrity and character and do our best to give the people a champions league game . "
klinsmann admitted the defeat had been a blow for him but said he never thought of quitting his post .
" i 've had extreme moments before .
three months before the world cup , we went down 4-1 to italy and then went on to have a summer fairy tale , " said the 44-year-old in reference to germany 's run to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup on home soil .

they are also still in the spanish cup .
" we are close to three titles and do n't want to let any of them escape us , " said playmaker xavi .
captain says ribery should go meanwhile bayern munich 's french midfielder franck ribery has been told by his own captain that he should join barcelona next season .
" franck wants to play for barcelona , " bayern skipper mark van bommel told spain 's rac-1 radio on monday , in comments that will hardly go down well with the bayern board , who are desperate to hold on to their prize asset .

the government said the deaths occurred when red-clad demonstrators clashed with local residents , who had armed themselves and set up roadblocks to counter the protesters near government house , the seat of thai government .
elsewhere , anti-government protesters clashed with security forces , leaving over 20 troops injured , and set fire to a government ministry with molotov cocktails . making it clear they were prepared for a " final stand , " the so-called red shirt protesters later retreated to their camp near the offices of prime minister abhisit , just one day after the embattled premier imposed a state of emergency in the capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have used live munition to disperse protesters abhisit warns protesters " those who want to help the government restore normality can return home , " abhisit said in a televised address .

his troops would not instigate violence , he said , but they did reserve the right to self-defense if attacked .
thailand has been caught up in turmoil ever since the military toppled prime minister thaksin shinawatra in a coup in 2006 .
the protesters want abhisit , who only took office in december , to step down , saying he came to power through an undemocratic parliamentary vote following a court ruling that drove thaksin 's allies from power . db / jen , ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elsewhere , anti-government protesters clashed with security forces , leaving over 20 troops injured , and set fire to a government ministry with molotov cocktails . making it clear they were prepared for a " final stand , " the so-called red shirt protesters later retreated to their camp near the offices of prime minister abhisit , just one day after the embattled premier imposed a state of emergency in the capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have used live munition to disperse protesters abhisit warns protesters " those who want to help the government restore normality can return home , " abhisit said in a televised address .
" the government has carefully mapped out a plan to implement the law . "
abhisit is under intense pressure after the red shirts stormed the venue of an asian summit on saturday .
the summit had to be postponed as leaders abandoned the venue , some by helicopter .
the unrest moved on to bangkok on sunday , when demonstrators attacked a convoy carrying abhisit out of the interior ministry .
much of the city was shut down on monday for the thai new year holiday of songkran .
military to restore order by all means supreme military commander songkitti jaggabatara has , meanwhile , pledged to restore order using " all possible means . ”
his troops would not instigate violence , he said , but they did reserve the right to self-defense if attacked .
thailand has been caught up in turmoil ever since the military toppled prime minister thaksin shinawatra in a coup in 2006 .
the protesters want abhisit , who only took office in december , to step down , saying he came to power through an undemocratic parliamentary vote following a court ruling that drove thaksin 's allies from power . db / jen , ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to iran 's isna news agency , jalili , who is a top official at iran 's supreme national security council , spoke to solana on the telephone .
isna on monday quoted jalili as saying that tehran would soon declare its official stance on the matter .
in brussels , a spokeswoman for solana confirmed that he and jalili " had a constructive conversation , " and " agreed to remain in contact . "
last wednesday , the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , britain , russia , china , and france - together with germany tasked solana with inviting iran to discuss its nuclear program .
the west suspects tehran is secretly making atomic weapons and has repeatedly called on the country to stop its uranium enrichment program .
iran says its nuclear program is designed purely for generating electricity .
a new beginning on the persian new year day , us president barack obama advocated a " new beginning " in the relationship between the arch-foes , marking a major shift in us policy under the new administration .
while inaugurating iran 's first nuclear fuel plant last week , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said the islamic republic would be ready for talks with the west if they were based on respect and justice .
in washington , state department spokesman robert wood repeated the us offer to hold talks with iran without any preconditions , but said iran needed to show the international community that its nuclear program is a peaceful one .
“ right now , the international community is very skeptical about that , " wood said. db / nw / nk , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his comments have caused outraged among german atheist organizations . " without god , everything is permitted . "
with this famous quote from russian writer fyodor dostoyevsky , the bishop of the southern bavarian town of augsburg wanted to warn his congregation of what he sees as the dangers of atheism .
bishop mixa told churchgoers that a society without god was " hell on earth " and could result in bloody regimes such as those led by adolf hitler or the soviet union .
" decades past have proven the inhumanity of atheism through the godless regimes of national socialism and communism , with their penal camps , secret police and mass murder , " he said .
" wherever god is denied or fought against , there , humans and their dignity will also be denied and violated , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.04.2009 easter marches march on ... or is that limping ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those rainbows stand for peace leaders of germany ’ s peace movement were talking up the positives from this year ’ s more than 70 easter marches nationwide .
but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .
“ we 're from the generation that has known war , ” one older woman said .
“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .
the german easter march movement , which began as an echo of an anti-nuclear march led by bertrand russell in london , started in 1960 , meaning the 2010 marching season will be the movement 's 50th . mrh / jen , dpa / epd / wdr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .
“ we 're from the generation that has known war , ” one older woman said .
“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .
the german easter march movement , which began as an echo of an anti-nuclear march led by bertrand russell in london , started in 1960 , meaning the 2010 marching season will be the movement 's 50th . mrh / jen , dpa / epd / wdr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu 's czech presidency called on protesters " to refrain from further violent action , " adding that they only risked harming " the stability and the reputation of their country . ”
a czech statement also said the eu hoped thailand 's political divide would be solved by democratic and parliamentary means , within the framework of the country 's constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest claimed the lives of two people on tuesday locals take up arms thai hospital officials say two people have been killed , and over 100 injured , in political violence on the streets of bangkok .
the government said the deaths occurred when red-clad demonstrators clashed with local residents , who had armed themselves and set up roadblocks to counter the protesters near government house , the seat of thai government .
elsewhere , anti-government protesters clashed with security forces , leaving over 20 troops injured , and set fire to a government ministry with molotov cocktails . making it clear they were prepared for a " final stand , " the so-called red shirt protesters later retreated to their camp near the offices of prime minister abhisit , just one day after the embattled premier imposed a state of emergency in the capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have used live munition to disperse protesters abhisit warns protesters " those who want to help the government restore normality can return home , " abhisit said in a televised address .
" the government has carefully mapped out a plan to implement the law . "
abhisit is under intense pressure after the red shirts stormed the venue of an asian summit on saturday .
the summit had to be postponed as leaders abandoned the venue , some by helicopter .
the unrest moved on to bangkok on sunday , when demonstrators attacked a convoy carrying abhisit out of the interior ministry .
much of the city was shut down on monday for the thai new year holiday of songkran .
military to restore order by all means supreme military commander songkitti jaggabatara has , meanwhile , pledged to restore order using " all possible means . ”
his troops would not instigate violence , he said , but they did reserve the right to self-defense if attacked .
thailand has been caught up in turmoil ever since the military toppled prime minister thaksin shinawatra in a coup in 2006 .
the protesters want abhisit , who only took office in december , to step down , saying he came to power through an undemocratic parliamentary vote following a court ruling that drove thaksin 's allies from power . db / jen , ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering says the state may have to step in for opel " frau merkel will not be able to continue refusing state participation in opel if that turns out to be the only way to rescue opel , " said muentefering , who added that he and his party also would prefer a private investor taking a stake in opel .
" there are too many jobs on the line , " said muentefering .
the spd chairman also pointed out that leaders of four german states where opel plants are based have also signalled that a government rescue can not be ruled out .
they include three cdu state premiers - roland koch of hesse , juergen ruettgers of north rhine-westphalia and dieter althaus of thuringia - as well as spd state premier kurt beck in rhineland-palatinate .
but angela merkel 's chief of staff , thomas de maiziere , once again denied that the state would be taking over all or part of opel .
it is " important " that opel find private investors , he told the saechsische zeitung newspaper . nk / rwd / jen , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about half of the documents have been pulled from the rubble , but now more work must be done to preserve the material . for the past several weeks , more than 60 firemen and volunteers have been spending most of their days at the site where the archive once stood .
with scoops , cranes and even their bare hands , they search through the rubble not for bodies , but for paper . that is because the documented history of the entire region now lays buried under 60 tons of rock and other debris . " today we just found a document from the 11th century , " said cologne fireman thomas buergermann .
" this is what we are doing , looking and searching for archival material , 12 hours a day every day , with the exception of sunday . " since the collapse of the archive building on march 3 , workers have been present at the site .

the goal now : saving face . bayern munich president franz beckenbauer described the first half of the game in barcelona , when lionel messi scored twice and thierry henry and samuel eto 'o also got on the scoresheet , as the worst half of football he had ever seen played by a bayern team .
there were calls in some quarters for the dismissal of coach jurgen klinsmann but the pressure on the former germany boss has abated somewhat in the wake of a 4-0 demolition of eintracht frankfurt in the bundesliga at the weekend .
on tuesday , the team will be playing mostly for pride .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said the first leg was the worst he had ever seen " we are not going to beat them by four goals , that 's clear to us , " said klinsmann .
" however , we will show that we have integrity and character and do our best to give the people a champions league game . "
klinsmann admitted the defeat had been a blow for him but said he never thought of quitting his post .
" i 've had extreme moments before .
three months before the world cup , we went down 4-1 to italy and then went on to have a summer fairy tale , " said the 44-year-old in reference to germany 's run to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup on home soil .
klinsi : ' i will see this through ' however , chants calling for klinsmann 's removal could be heard from the stands during bayern 's victory over frankfurt .
the coach said they would not affect him .
" we are putting everything into bayern every day and i am going to see this through , " said klinsmann .
barcelona coach josep guardiola , who will have to watch his 50th competitive game in charge of the catalan giants from the stands of the allianz arena after being sent off in the first leg , is expected to rest several key players against the german champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should frenchman ribery go to barca ?
messi and henry , who tormented bayern a week ago , are expected to start on the bench while defender rafael marquez is expected to remain in barcelona after picking up a yellow card in the first leg .
as well as performing strongly in europe , barca currently top the primera liga and maintained their six-point lead over real madrid with a 2-0 victory over recreativo de huelva on saturday .
they are also still in the spanish cup .
" we are close to three titles and do n't want to let any of them escape us , " said playmaker xavi .
captain says ribery should go meanwhile bayern munich 's french midfielder franck ribery has been told by his own captain that he should join barcelona next season .
" franck wants to play for barcelona , " bayern skipper mark van bommel told spain 's rac-1 radio on monday , in comments that will hardly go down well with the bayern board , who are desperate to hold on to their prize asset .
" more than that , i think it would be a good thing if barca buys him , he would adapt easily , " said the dutchman , who won a champions league title with barcelona in 2006 . jen , ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .
“ we 're from the generation that has known war , ” one older woman said .
“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .
the german easter march movement , which began as an echo of an anti-nuclear march led by bertrand russell in london , started in 1960 , meaning the 2010 marching season will be the movement 's 50th . mrh / jen , dpa / epd / wdr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 13.04.2009 german bishop : atheism responsible for nazis and mass murder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop mixa has made controversial comments on several occasions a german bishop has told his easter congregation that mass murder and other crimes committed by the nazis are evidence that atheism is inhumane .
his comments have caused outraged among german atheist organizations . " without god , everything is permitted . "
with this famous quote from russian writer fyodor dostoyevsky , the bishop of the southern bavarian town of augsburg wanted to warn his congregation of what he sees as the dangers of atheism .
bishop mixa told churchgoers that a society without god was " hell on earth " and could result in bloody regimes such as those led by adolf hitler or the soviet union .
" decades past have proven the inhumanity of atheism through the godless regimes of national socialism and communism , with their penal camps , secret police and mass murder , " he said .
" wherever god is denied or fought against , there , humans and their dignity will also be denied and violated , " he added .
falsification of history rudolf ladwig , the head of german atheist organization ibka , said bishop mixa 's comments were completely " untenable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six million jews are believed to have died during wwii ladwig told german news magazine spiegel that mixa 's comments were part of a long-running strategy by the church to incorrectly rewrite its own historical dealings with fascism .
" resistance from the church -lsb- to national socialism -rsb- only came from individuals , " he said .
bishop mixa was also criticized by michael schmidt-salomon from the giordano bruno foundation , a german organization in support of evolutionary humanism .
schmidt-salomon told spiegel the argument that national socialism was godless was a " grand falsification . "
" evidence shows that the majority of the nazi elite considered themselves christian , " schmidt-salomon said .
a history of controversial comments bishop mixa is known in germany as being outspoken and has ruffled feathers on more than one occasion .
in just one example in february , mixa compared the number of jews murdered by the nazis to the number of abortions over the past few decades .
he also upset politicians two years ago when he criticized government plans to expand childcare facilities in germany .
mixa said the plans used federal aid to entice women to entrust their children to state care shortly after birth , degrading women to " birthing machines . " ca / ncy , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his comments have caused outraged among german atheist organizations . " without god , everything is permitted . "
with this famous quote from russian writer fyodor dostoyevsky , the bishop of the southern bavarian town of augsburg wanted to warn his congregation of what he sees as the dangers of atheism .
bishop mixa told churchgoers that a society without god was " hell on earth " and could result in bloody regimes such as those led by adolf hitler or the soviet union .
" decades past have proven the inhumanity of atheism through the godless regimes of national socialism and communism , with their penal camps , secret police and mass murder , " he said .

in just one example in february , mixa compared the number of jews murdered by the nazis to the number of abortions over the past few decades .

the goal now : saving face . bayern munich president franz beckenbauer described the first half of the game in barcelona , when lionel messi scored twice and thierry henry and samuel eto 'o also got on the scoresheet , as the worst half of football he had ever seen played by a bayern team .
there were calls in some quarters for the dismissal of coach jurgen klinsmann but the pressure on the former germany boss has abated somewhat in the wake of a 4-0 demolition of eintracht frankfurt in the bundesliga at the weekend .
on tuesday , the team will be playing mostly for pride .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said the first leg was the worst he had ever seen " we are not going to beat them by four goals , that 's clear to us , " said klinsmann .
" however , we will show that we have integrity and character and do our best to give the people a champions league game . "
klinsmann admitted the defeat had been a blow for him but said he never thought of quitting his post .
" i 've had extreme moments before .
three months before the world cup , we went down 4-1 to italy and then went on to have a summer fairy tale , " said the 44-year-old in reference to germany 's run to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup on home soil .
klinsi : ' i will see this through ' however , chants calling for klinsmann 's removal could be heard from the stands during bayern 's victory over frankfurt .
the coach said they would not affect him .
" we are putting everything into bayern every day and i am going to see this through , " said klinsmann .
barcelona coach josep guardiola , who will have to watch his 50th competitive game in charge of the catalan giants from the stands of the allianz arena after being sent off in the first leg , is expected to rest several key players against the german champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should frenchman ribery go to barca ?
messi and henry , who tormented bayern a week ago , are expected to start on the bench while defender rafael marquez is expected to remain in barcelona after picking up a yellow card in the first leg .
as well as performing strongly in europe , barca currently top the primera liga and maintained their six-point lead over real madrid with a 2-0 victory over recreativo de huelva on saturday .
they are also still in the spanish cup .
" we are close to three titles and do n't want to let any of them escape us , " said playmaker xavi .

let us be strong to fight for true democracy for our people . " thaksin , who has been living in exile since a coup forced him from power in 2006 , said the protests were a " golden opportunity " to dislodge the current government , which he described as illegitimate . he also thanked soldiers who refused to enforce the government 's emergency measures and urged the military to join the so-called " red shirt " movement to oust prime minister abhisit vejjajiva .

authorities did not say how long the state of emergency would be in force , but abhisit said the next three to four days would be " crucial to returning to peace . "
the measure bans public gatherings of more than five people and allows security forces to detain suspects for up to 30 days without charge .

officials said scores of people were wounded as troops enforcing a state of emergency clashed with protesters . police estimated that up to 30,000 red-shirted anti-government protesters had gathered around the capital , bangkok , on sunday . in a telephone address to protesters gathered outside the prime minister 's offices , thaksin attacked the government 's response to the demonstrations , and held out the possibility of returning to thailand to lead the protesters ' movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaksin is wanted in thailand on corruption charges " now that they have tanks on the streets , it is time for the people to come out in revolution , " he said .
" and when it is necessary , i will come back to the country .
let us be strong to fight for true democracy for our people . " thaksin , who has been living in exile since a coup forced him from power in 2006 , said the protests were a " golden opportunity " to dislodge the current government , which he described as illegitimate . he also thanked soldiers who refused to enforce the government 's emergency measures and urged the military to join the so-called " red shirt " movement to oust prime minister abhisit vejjajiva . " the troops who have already come out can come and join the red shirts to help us to get democracy for the people , " he said . state of emergency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors want to see the current prime minister gone earlier , the thai government declared a state of emergency in bangkok and surrounding areas after protesters forced the cancellation of an association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- summit on saturday . the announcement came as hundreds of protesters stormed the interior ministry , demanding premier abhisit vejjajiva 's resigantion .
abhisit managed to escape the complex by car after soldiers guarding him fired shots in the air to keep demonstrators at bay .
in a tv address , abhisit said the nation was " in danger " because of unreasonable , self-serving people .
government officials said soldiers and armored vehicles had been deployed to secure public buildings , intersections and public transportation at 50 locations throughout the city .
authorities did not say how long the state of emergency would be in force , but abhisit said the next three to four days would be " crucial to returning to peace . "
the measure bans public gatherings of more than five people and allows security forces to detain suspects for up to 30 days without charge .
officials can also enforce strict controls on media and all other forms of communication .
this is the third time a state of emergency has been called in the capital since september 2008 .

arisman pongruengrong 's arrest came as the prime minister promised to take legal action against thaksin 's supporters .
in his weekly televised address to the nation , abhisit described the protesters as " enemies of thailand " and vowed to bring order and peace back to the divided country .
ongoing uncertainty thaksin 's supporters are demanding abhisit 's resignation and new elections just four months after he took office .
abhisit was installed as prime minister in a parliamentary vote after a court ruling removed thaksin 's allies from power in response to anti-thaksin protesters occupying two thai airports for a week .
four prime ministers over the last 15 months have failed in their attempts to stabilize the country and saturday 's dramatic evacuation of foreign leaders from the asean summit venue by helicopter is another embarrassment for the thai government .
ahead of the summit , the thai government had given assurances that it would take whatever measures necessary to prevent such a situation .
officials have now acknowledged that security forces had failed to do just that .

about half of the documents have been pulled from the rubble , but now more work must be done to preserve the material . for the past several weeks , more than 60 firemen and volunteers have been spending most of their days at the site where the archive once stood .
with scoops , cranes and even their bare hands , they search through the rubble not for bodies , but for paper . that is because the documented history of the entire region now lays buried under 60 tons of rock and other debris . " today we just found a document from the 11th century , " said cologne fireman thomas buergermann .
" this is what we are doing , looking and searching for archival material , 12 hours a day every day , with the exception of sunday . " since the collapse of the archive building on march 3 , workers have been present at the site .
they plan to stay until the last document has been uncovered . " we 'll do this job until the last historical items have been found , said johannes feirer , cologne 's deputy fire chief .
" i think that we have already recovered more than half of the historical materials , " he said .
bildunterschrift : workers and volunteers have been at the site non-stop a " safe haven " for uncovered documents the archive materials are being brought to a furniture warehouse located about 20 kilometers outside of cologne .
as soon as the firemen find something they believe to be of significance , they record exactly where in the rubble they found the item , pack it in a box , and ship it to the furniture warehouse in porz , one of the city 's suburbs . in the long halls of the warehouse , there are hundreds of boxes full of random parchments , scrolls , papers , and books .
some are clean and dry , others dirty and wet .
dressed in white plastic suits and wearing hoods and protective masks , archivists , restorers , and volunteers from the rhineland and beyond have come here to begin the mindboggling task of preserving and organizing the recovered materials . the archivists and restorers are especially concerned with water-damaged documents .
for once the document begins to mold , the chance of preserving it is next to none .
archivists use dry ice to freeze documents before they can begin the long process of being restored . documents that were exposed to water while buried under the rubble must remain frozen for months before being dried .
this is the only way to prevent mold from forming . max plassman , one of four main archivists responsible for the preservation of the recovered documents , said this process would be unthinkable without the help of volunteers . " we have to stress the fact that most of the work here is done by volunteers , " he said .
" it is a very important fact for us , because we could n't handle this process on our own .

for the region 's universities , the preservation of recovered documents is absolutely critical .

"
the man was reacting to a new york times newspaper report on monday , which said us big-three carmaker gm may undergo what it called a " surgical " bankruptcy as early as june 1 .
carl-peter forster , the head of gm europe , also said a possible bankruptcy at gm posed no danger to opel .
" our production and the sale of cars in europe wo n't be affected , " he said .
and , the head of the works council at the opel plant in eisenach , germany , harald lieske , added his voice to those assuring calm .
lieske told germany 's mdr radio station that , " opel belongs to the healthy part of the company .
we are of the opinion that legally , this so-called surgical bankruptcy will not have any direct impact on us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , with gm europe 's forster ; the chancellor opposes state aid on the contrary , some opel officials voiced the opinion that opel-vauxhall would come out of the economic squeeze more independent and stronger than before .
according to the new york times , the us government has ordered gm to file for bankruptcy by june 1 .
the idea is to effectuate a " surgical bankruptcy , " which would divide gm 's " good " assets from its unhealthy ones .
muentefering says too many jobs at stake the new york times report was based on unnamed sources .
but gm 's new chief executive , fritz henderson , recently told the canadian broadcasting company , " if we need to resort to bankruptcy , we have to do it quickly . ”
in berlin , a political battle is being waged over whether or not the state will step in and take a stake in opel to help it through the tough times .
franz muentefering , chairman of the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- party which shares power with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the chancellor would have to consider taking a stake in opel if other rescue efforts failed .
in an interview with bild am sonntag newspaper , muentefering said there were 25,000 jobs at stake and the company was too important to simply let it fail if no investor was found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering says the state may have to step in for opel " frau merkel will not be able to continue refusing state participation in opel if that turns out to be the only way to rescue opel , " said muentefering , who added that he and his party also would prefer a private investor taking a stake in opel .
" there are too many jobs on the line , " said muentefering .
the spd chairman also pointed out that leaders of four german states where opel plants are based have also signalled that a government rescue can not be ruled out .
they include three cdu state premiers - roland koch of hesse , juergen ruettgers of north rhine-westphalia and dieter althaus of thuringia - as well as spd state premier kurt beck in rhineland-palatinate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.04.2009 easter marches march on ... or is that limping ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those rainbows stand for peace leaders of germany ’ s peace movement were talking up the positives from this year ’ s more than 70 easter marches nationwide .
but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .
“ we 're from the generation that has known war , ” one older woman said .
“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .
the german easter march movement , which began as an echo of an anti-nuclear march led by bertrand russell in london , started in 1960 , meaning the 2010 marching season will be the movement 's 50th . mrh / jen , dpa / epd / wdr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

witnesses said the fire brigade only had ladders long enough to reach the first floor windows , and that many of the survivors jumped from the building to escape the flames .

fratczak said 20 people were taken to hospital with broken bones and other injuries after escaping the blaze .
" the fire spread at an incredible speed , " rescuer daniel kopalinski said at the scene .
" firefighters had to catch children thrown through windows by their parents , " he added .

his comments have caused outraged among german atheist organizations . " without god , everything is permitted . "
with this famous quote from russian writer fyodor dostoyevsky , the bishop of the southern bavarian town of augsburg wanted to warn his congregation of what he sees as the dangers of atheism .
bishop mixa told churchgoers that a society without god was " hell on earth " and could result in bloody regimes such as those led by adolf hitler or the soviet union .
" decades past have proven the inhumanity of atheism through the godless regimes of national socialism and communism , with their penal camps , secret police and mass murder , " he said .
" wherever god is denied or fought against , there , humans and their dignity will also be denied and violated , " he added .

bishop mixa was also criticized by michael schmidt-salomon from the giordano bruno foundation , a german organization in support of evolutionary humanism .
schmidt-salomon told spiegel the argument that national socialism was godless was a " grand falsification . "
" evidence shows that the majority of the nazi elite considered themselves christian , " schmidt-salomon said .
a history of controversial comments bishop mixa is known in germany as being outspoken and has ruffled feathers on more than one occasion .
in just one example in february , mixa compared the number of jews murdered by the nazis to the number of abortions over the past few decades .
he also upset politicians two years ago when he criticized government plans to expand childcare facilities in germany .

" and when it is necessary , i will come back to the country .
let us be strong to fight for true democracy for our people . " thaksin , who has been living in exile since a coup forced him from power in 2006 , said the protests were a " golden opportunity " to dislodge the current government , which he described as illegitimate . he also thanked soldiers who refused to enforce the government 's emergency measures and urged the military to join the so-called " red shirt " movement to oust prime minister abhisit vejjajiva .

abhisit managed to escape the complex by car after soldiers guarding him fired shots in the air to keep demonstrators at bay .
in a tv address , abhisit said the nation was " in danger " because of unreasonable , self-serving people .
government officials said soldiers and armored vehicles had been deployed to secure public buildings , intersections and public transportation at 50 locations throughout the city .
authorities did not say how long the state of emergency would be in force , but abhisit said the next three to four days would be " crucial to returning to peace . "
the measure bans public gatherings of more than five people and allows security forces to detain suspects for up to 30 days without charge .

four prime ministers over the last 15 months have failed in their attempts to stabilize the country and saturday 's dramatic evacuation of foreign leaders from the asean summit venue by helicopter is another embarrassment for the thai government .

officials said scores of people were wounded as troops enforcing a state of emergency clashed with protesters . police estimated that up to 30,000 red-shirted anti-government protesters had gathered around the capital , bangkok , on sunday . in a telephone address to protesters gathered outside the prime minister 's offices , thaksin attacked the government 's response to the demonstrations , and held out the possibility of returning to thailand to lead the protesters ' movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaksin is wanted in thailand on corruption charges " now that they have tanks on the streets , it is time for the people to come out in revolution , " he said .
" and when it is necessary , i will come back to the country .
let us be strong to fight for true democracy for our people . " thaksin , who has been living in exile since a coup forced him from power in 2006 , said the protests were a " golden opportunity " to dislodge the current government , which he described as illegitimate . he also thanked soldiers who refused to enforce the government 's emergency measures and urged the military to join the so-called " red shirt " movement to oust prime minister abhisit vejjajiva . " the troops who have already come out can come and join the red shirts to help us to get democracy for the people , " he said . state of emergency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors want to see the current prime minister gone earlier , the thai government declared a state of emergency in bangkok and surrounding areas after protesters forced the cancellation of an association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- summit on saturday . the announcement came as hundreds of protesters stormed the interior ministry , demanding premier abhisit vejjajiva 's resigantion .
abhisit managed to escape the complex by car after soldiers guarding him fired shots in the air to keep demonstrators at bay .
in a tv address , abhisit said the nation was " in danger " because of unreasonable , self-serving people .
government officials said soldiers and armored vehicles had been deployed to secure public buildings , intersections and public transportation at 50 locations throughout the city .
authorities did not say how long the state of emergency would be in force , but abhisit said the next three to four days would be " crucial to returning to peace . "
the measure bans public gatherings of more than five people and allows security forces to detain suspects for up to 30 days without charge .
officials can also enforce strict controls on media and all other forms of communication .
this is the third time a state of emergency has been called in the capital since september 2008 .
thai police arrest protest leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protest leader arisman pongreungrong may be feeling less victorious after his arrest the interior ministry was stormed after thai police arrested the leader of saturday 's anti-government protests .
arisman pongruengrong 's arrest came as the prime minister promised to take legal action against thaksin 's supporters .
in his weekly televised address to the nation , abhisit described the protesters as " enemies of thailand " and vowed to bring order and peace back to the divided country .
ongoing uncertainty thaksin 's supporters are demanding abhisit 's resignation and new elections just four months after he took office .
abhisit was installed as prime minister in a parliamentary vote after a court ruling removed thaksin 's allies from power in response to anti-thaksin protesters occupying two thai airports for a week .
four prime ministers over the last 15 months have failed in their attempts to stabilize the country and saturday 's dramatic evacuation of foreign leaders from the asean summit venue by helicopter is another embarrassment for the thai government .
ahead of the summit , the thai government had given assurances that it would take whatever measures necessary to prevent such a situation .
officials have now acknowledged that security forces had failed to do just that .
missed opportunities at cancelled summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao was meant to announce a multi-billion dollar investment fund at the summit the summit was meant to bring together southeast asian leaders with ministers from china , south korea , japan , india , australia and new zealand and un secretary general ban ki-moon to discuss the global financial crisis and north korea 's recent rocket launch .
asian leaders were also expected to sign an investment pact with china .
china has announced an offer of $ 15 billion in credit to asean countries and a $ 10 billion infrastructure investment fund .
the asean meeting had already been delayed by previous clashes between anti-government and pro-government supporters .
thai officials now say talks will be held in about two months ' time . sje / pfd / tt , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are too many jobs on the line , " said muentefering .
the spd chairman also pointed out that leaders of four german states where opel plants are based have also signalled that a government rescue can not be ruled out .
they include three cdu state premiers - roland koch of hesse , juergen ruettgers of north rhine-westphalia and dieter althaus of thuringia - as well as spd state premier kurt beck in rhineland-palatinate .

according to iran 's isna news agency , jalili , who is a top official at iran 's supreme national security council , spoke to solana on the telephone .
isna on monday quoted jalili as saying that tehran would soon declare its official stance on the matter .
in brussels , a spokeswoman for solana confirmed that he and jalili " had a constructive conversation , " and " agreed to remain in contact . "
last wednesday , the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , britain , russia , china , and france - together with germany tasked solana with inviting iran to discuss its nuclear program .
the west suspects tehran is secretly making atomic weapons and has repeatedly called on the country to stop its uranium enrichment program .
iran says its nuclear program is designed purely for generating electricity .
a new beginning on the persian new year day , us president barack obama advocated a " new beginning " in the relationship between the arch-foes , marking a major shift in us policy under the new administration .
while inaugurating iran 's first nuclear fuel plant last week , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said the islamic republic would be ready for talks with the west if they were based on respect and justice .
in washington , state department spokesman robert wood repeated the us offer to hold talks with iran without any preconditions , but said iran needed to show the international community that its nuclear program is a peaceful one .
“ right now , the international community is very skeptical about that , " wood said. db / nw / nk , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu 's czech presidency called on protesters " to refrain from further violent action , " adding that they only risked harming " the stability and the reputation of their country . ”

the government said the deaths occurred when red-clad demonstrators clashed with local residents , who had armed themselves and set up roadblocks to counter the protesters near government house , the seat of thai government .
elsewhere , anti-government protesters clashed with security forces , leaving over 20 troops injured , and set fire to a government ministry with molotov cocktails . making it clear they were prepared for a " final stand , " the so-called red shirt protesters later retreated to their camp near the offices of prime minister abhisit , just one day after the embattled premier imposed a state of emergency in the capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have used live munition to disperse protesters abhisit warns protesters " those who want to help the government restore normality can return home , " abhisit said in a televised address .

but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .
“ we 're from the generation that has known war , ” one older woman said .
“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .

but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .
“ we 're from the generation that has known war , ” one older woman said .
“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .
the german easter march movement , which began as an echo of an anti-nuclear march led by bertrand russell in london , started in 1960 , meaning the 2010 marching season will be the movement 's 50th . mrh / jen , dpa / epd / wdr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a local taliban commander has claimed responsibility for killing the high-school teacher and provincial legislator .
achikzai and her husband , a doctor and university lecturer , had returned from exile to work in the southern afghan city of kandahar , leaving their son and daughter in germany .
the taliban have carried out similar assassinations in kandahar in recent years .
last year they admitted to murdering the country 's highest profile female police officer , and they are believed to have been behind the 2006 assassination of the head of the provincial women 's affairs department .
two years ago , zarghona kakar , another woman on the kandahar provincial council , survived a taliban assassination attempt in which her husband was killed .
taliban members also sprayed acid into the faces of schoolgirls in kandahar in november last year .
the taliban militia was established in kandahar province in the early 1990s and ruled afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 .
during their time in government , the taliban placed heavy restrictions on women , barring them from education and work outside the home . ch / ncy , afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.04.2009 easter marches march on ... or is that limping ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those rainbows stand for peace leaders of germany ’ s peace movement were talking up the positives from this year ’ s more than 70 easter marches nationwide .
but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .
“ we 're from the generation that has known war , ” one older woman said .
“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .
the german easter march movement , which began as an echo of an anti-nuclear march led by bertrand russell in london , started in 1960 , meaning the 2010 marching season will be the movement 's 50th . mrh / jen , dpa / epd / wdr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a local taliban commander has claimed responsibility for killing the high-school teacher and provincial legislator .
achikzai and her husband , a doctor and university lecturer , had returned from exile to work in the southern afghan city of kandahar , leaving their son and daughter in germany .
the taliban have carried out similar assassinations in kandahar in recent years .
last year they admitted to murdering the country 's highest profile female police officer , and they are believed to have been behind the 2006 assassination of the head of the provincial women 's affairs department .
two years ago , zarghona kakar , another woman on the kandahar provincial council , survived a taliban assassination attempt in which her husband was killed .
taliban members also sprayed acid into the faces of schoolgirls in kandahar in november last year .
the taliban militia was established in kandahar province in the early 1990s and ruled afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 .
during their time in government , the taliban placed heavy restrictions on women , barring them from education and work outside the home . ch / ncy , afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about half of the documents have been pulled from the rubble , but now more work must be done to preserve the material . for the past several weeks , more than 60 firemen and volunteers have been spending most of their days at the site where the archive once stood .
with scoops , cranes and even their bare hands , they search through the rubble not for bodies , but for paper . that is because the documented history of the entire region now lays buried under 60 tons of rock and other debris . " today we just found a document from the 11th century , " said cologne fireman thomas buergermann .
" this is what we are doing , looking and searching for archival material , 12 hours a day every day , with the exception of sunday . " since the collapse of the archive building on march 3 , workers have been present at the site .
they plan to stay until the last document has been uncovered . " we 'll do this job until the last historical items have been found , said johannes feirer , cologne 's deputy fire chief .
" i think that we have already recovered more than half of the historical materials , " he said .
bildunterschrift : workers and volunteers have been at the site non-stop a " safe haven " for uncovered documents the archive materials are being brought to a furniture warehouse located about 20 kilometers outside of cologne .
as soon as the firemen find something they believe to be of significance , they record exactly where in the rubble they found the item , pack it in a box , and ship it to the furniture warehouse in porz , one of the city 's suburbs . in the long halls of the warehouse , there are hundreds of boxes full of random parchments , scrolls , papers , and books .
some are clean and dry , others dirty and wet .
dressed in white plastic suits and wearing hoods and protective masks , archivists , restorers , and volunteers from the rhineland and beyond have come here to begin the mindboggling task of preserving and organizing the recovered materials . the archivists and restorers are especially concerned with water-damaged documents .
for once the document begins to mold , the chance of preserving it is next to none .
archivists use dry ice to freeze documents before they can begin the long process of being restored . documents that were exposed to water while buried under the rubble must remain frozen for months before being dried .
this is the only way to prevent mold from forming . max plassman , one of four main archivists responsible for the preservation of the recovered documents , said this process would be unthinkable without the help of volunteers . " we have to stress the fact that most of the work here is done by volunteers , " he said .
" it is a very important fact for us , because we could n't handle this process on our own .
they are turning up daily by the hundreds here .
it 's unbelievable . " crucial to the rhineland the efforts to preserve the documents of cologne 's archive are really efforts to preserve cologne 's history , which dates back to the roman empire . for the historians of the rhineland , the archive collapse is especially devastating .
for the region 's universities , the preservation of recovered documents is absolutely critical . " you have to understand that the history of our region , the rhineland , is influenced very much by cologne , which was and is the largest city in the area , " said andreas rutz , an assistant professor of history at the university of bonn . " we have a number of phd students working on cologne subjects .
they 're writing their dissertations on the history of cologne .
for them above all it 's a big catastrophe .
they have no chance of actually finishing their dissertations the way they planned to .
so for them it would be great , if these things were found .
because then they would be able to continue . " author : gabriel borrud editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said scores of people were wounded as troops enforcing a state of emergency clashed with protesters . police estimated that up to 30,000 red-shirted anti-government protesters had gathered around the capital , bangkok , on sunday . in a telephone address to protesters gathered outside the prime minister 's offices , thaksin attacked the government 's response to the demonstrations , and held out the possibility of returning to thailand to lead the protesters ' movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaksin is wanted in thailand on corruption charges " now that they have tanks on the streets , it is time for the people to come out in revolution , " he said .
" and when it is necessary , i will come back to the country .
let us be strong to fight for true democracy for our people . " thaksin , who has been living in exile since a coup forced him from power in 2006 , said the protests were a " golden opportunity " to dislodge the current government , which he described as illegitimate . he also thanked soldiers who refused to enforce the government 's emergency measures and urged the military to join the so-called " red shirt " movement to oust prime minister abhisit vejjajiva . " the troops who have already come out can come and join the red shirts to help us to get democracy for the people , " he said . state of emergency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors want to see the current prime minister gone earlier , the thai government declared a state of emergency in bangkok and surrounding areas after protesters forced the cancellation of an association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- summit on saturday . the announcement came as hundreds of protesters stormed the interior ministry , demanding premier abhisit vejjajiva 's resigantion .
abhisit managed to escape the complex by car after soldiers guarding him fired shots in the air to keep demonstrators at bay .
in a tv address , abhisit said the nation was " in danger " because of unreasonable , self-serving people .
government officials said soldiers and armored vehicles had been deployed to secure public buildings , intersections and public transportation at 50 locations throughout the city .
authorities did not say how long the state of emergency would be in force , but abhisit said the next three to four days would be " crucial to returning to peace . "
the measure bans public gatherings of more than five people and allows security forces to detain suspects for up to 30 days without charge .
officials can also enforce strict controls on media and all other forms of communication .
this is the third time a state of emergency has been called in the capital since september 2008 .

arisman pongruengrong 's arrest came as the prime minister promised to take legal action against thaksin 's supporters .
in his weekly televised address to the nation , abhisit described the protesters as " enemies of thailand " and vowed to bring order and peace back to the divided country .
ongoing uncertainty thaksin 's supporters are demanding abhisit 's resignation and new elections just four months after he took office .
abhisit was installed as prime minister in a parliamentary vote after a court ruling removed thaksin 's allies from power in response to anti-thaksin protesters occupying two thai airports for a week .
four prime ministers over the last 15 months have failed in their attempts to stabilize the country and saturday 's dramatic evacuation of foreign leaders from the asean summit venue by helicopter is another embarrassment for the thai government .
ahead of the summit , the thai government had given assurances that it would take whatever measures necessary to prevent such a situation .

his comments have caused outraged among german atheist organizations . " without god , everything is permitted . "
with this famous quote from russian writer fyodor dostoyevsky , the bishop of the southern bavarian town of augsburg wanted to warn his congregation of what he sees as the dangers of atheism .
bishop mixa told churchgoers that a society without god was " hell on earth " and could result in bloody regimes such as those led by adolf hitler or the soviet union .
" decades past have proven the inhumanity of atheism through the godless regimes of national socialism and communism , with their penal camps , secret police and mass murder , " he said .
" wherever god is denied or fought against , there , humans and their dignity will also be denied and violated , " he added .
falsification of history rudolf ladwig , the head of german atheist organization ibka , said bishop mixa 's comments were completely " untenable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six million jews are believed to have died during wwii ladwig told german news magazine spiegel that mixa 's comments were part of a long-running strategy by the church to incorrectly rewrite its own historical dealings with fascism .
" resistance from the church -lsb- to national socialism -rsb- only came from individuals , " he said .
bishop mixa was also criticized by michael schmidt-salomon from the giordano bruno foundation , a german organization in support of evolutionary humanism .
schmidt-salomon told spiegel the argument that national socialism was godless was a " grand falsification . "
" evidence shows that the majority of the nazi elite considered themselves christian , " schmidt-salomon said .
a history of controversial comments bishop mixa is known in germany as being outspoken and has ruffled feathers on more than one occasion .
in just one example in february , mixa compared the number of jews murdered by the nazis to the number of abortions over the past few decades .
he also upset politicians two years ago when he criticized government plans to expand childcare facilities in germany .
mixa said the plans used federal aid to entice women to entrust their children to state care shortly after birth , degrading women to " birthing machines . " ca / ncy , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the business model is seen to provide stability and security in tough times . already established in the banking and agricultural sectors , cooperatives in germany are beginning to expand to other fields as small and medium-sized enterprises look for security during the ongoing economic crisis . " we even notice new fields of activity like health care and the energy sector , " said eckhard ott , head of the german cooperative and raiffeisen confederation -lrb- dgrv -rrb- .
" due to the hard economic situation of many suppliers in the healthcare sector , medics and health care networks are founded as cooperatives . " cooperative members retain ownership of their individual businesses but benefit from being able to cooperate to increase profitability by negotiating better prices from suppliers , develop new business opportunities and share risk for large projects they may have otherwise been wary of taking on . " the decision to run the business as a cooperative was the result of a longer process with the intention to reorganize marketing and sales and increase knowledge exchange , " said dirk lukas , a spokesman for the buso cooperative for the solar heating industry . many reasons to form a co-op bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cooperatives have expanded to encompass the solar energy sector lukas said the cooperative model allowed the group 's 130 members to handle growing demand for their products with a system that meets the needs of manufacturers and installers who may not have otherwise been able to engage in large , profitable projects . germany is home to around 8,000 cooperatives with roughly 20 million members .
with 250 co-ops created last year , the number of cooperatives formed in germany has almost doubled in comparison to 2007 .
part of the renewed interest in the business model is due to a 2006 legal amendment making the associations easier to form , ott said . " new cooperatives now have the possibility to promote cultural or social objects , " he said , adding that it takes just three people to form a cooperative .
" that makes cooperatives attractive for cultural and social ventures like hospitals , senior citizen homes , cinemas , theaters or even indoor swimming pools . " the economic security provided by cooperatives also entices businesses to form cooperatives .
while the most recent data from the german statistics office shows about one percent of all german businesses were declared insolvent in 2005 , less than 0.1 percent of german cooperatives went bankrupt in 2008 , lukas said . " the cooperative structure is very safe in terms of economic ups and downs , " he added . author : steffen marquardt / sean sinico editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about half of the documents have been pulled from the rubble , but now more work must be done to preserve the material . for the past several weeks , more than 60 firemen and volunteers have been spending most of their days at the site where the archive once stood .
with scoops , cranes and even their bare hands , they search through the rubble not for bodies , but for paper . that is because the documented history of the entire region now lays buried under 60 tons of rock and other debris . " today we just found a document from the 11th century , " said cologne fireman thomas buergermann .
" this is what we are doing , looking and searching for archival material , 12 hours a day every day , with the exception of sunday . " since the collapse of the archive building on march 3 , workers have been present at the site .
they plan to stay until the last document has been uncovered . " we 'll do this job until the last historical items have been found , said johannes feirer , cologne 's deputy fire chief .
" i think that we have already recovered more than half of the historical materials , " he said .
bildunterschrift : workers and volunteers have been at the site non-stop a " safe haven " for uncovered documents the archive materials are being brought to a furniture warehouse located about 20 kilometers outside of cologne .
as soon as the firemen find something they believe to be of significance , they record exactly where in the rubble they found the item , pack it in a box , and ship it to the furniture warehouse in porz , one of the city 's suburbs . in the long halls of the warehouse , there are hundreds of boxes full of random parchments , scrolls , papers , and books .
some are clean and dry , others dirty and wet .
dressed in white plastic suits and wearing hoods and protective masks , archivists , restorers , and volunteers from the rhineland and beyond have come here to begin the mindboggling task of preserving and organizing the recovered materials . the archivists and restorers are especially concerned with water-damaged documents .
for once the document begins to mold , the chance of preserving it is next to none .
archivists use dry ice to freeze documents before they can begin the long process of being restored . documents that were exposed to water while buried under the rubble must remain frozen for months before being dried .
this is the only way to prevent mold from forming . max plassman , one of four main archivists responsible for the preservation of the recovered documents , said this process would be unthinkable without the help of volunteers . " we have to stress the fact that most of the work here is done by volunteers , " he said .
" it is a very important fact for us , because we could n't handle this process on our own .
they are turning up daily by the hundreds here .
it 's unbelievable . " crucial to the rhineland the efforts to preserve the documents of cologne 's archive are really efforts to preserve cologne 's history , which dates back to the roman empire . for the historians of the rhineland , the archive collapse is especially devastating .
for the region 's universities , the preservation of recovered documents is absolutely critical . " you have to understand that the history of our region , the rhineland , is influenced very much by cologne , which was and is the largest city in the area , " said andreas rutz , an assistant professor of history at the university of bonn . " we have a number of phd students working on cologne subjects .
they 're writing their dissertations on the history of cologne .
for them above all it 's a big catastrophe .
they have no chance of actually finishing their dissertations the way they planned to .
so for them it would be great , if these things were found .
because then they would be able to continue . " author : gabriel borrud editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about half of the documents have been pulled from the rubble , but now more work must be done to preserve the material . for the past several weeks , more than 60 firemen and volunteers have been spending most of their days at the site where the archive once stood .
with scoops , cranes and even their bare hands , they search through the rubble not for bodies , but for paper . that is because the documented history of the entire region now lays buried under 60 tons of rock and other debris . " today we just found a document from the 11th century , " said cologne fireman thomas buergermann .
" this is what we are doing , looking and searching for archival material , 12 hours a day every day , with the exception of sunday . " since the collapse of the archive building on march 3 , workers have been present at the site .
they plan to stay until the last document has been uncovered . " we 'll do this job until the last historical items have been found , said johannes feirer , cologne 's deputy fire chief .
" i think that we have already recovered more than half of the historical materials , " he said .
bildunterschrift : workers and volunteers have been at the site non-stop a " safe haven " for uncovered documents the archive materials are being brought to a furniture warehouse located about 20 kilometers outside of cologne .
as soon as the firemen find something they believe to be of significance , they record exactly where in the rubble they found the item , pack it in a box , and ship it to the furniture warehouse in porz , one of the city 's suburbs . in the long halls of the warehouse , there are hundreds of boxes full of random parchments , scrolls , papers , and books .
some are clean and dry , others dirty and wet .
dressed in white plastic suits and wearing hoods and protective masks , archivists , restorers , and volunteers from the rhineland and beyond have come here to begin the mindboggling task of preserving and organizing the recovered materials . the archivists and restorers are especially concerned with water-damaged documents .
for once the document begins to mold , the chance of preserving it is next to none .
archivists use dry ice to freeze documents before they can begin the long process of being restored . documents that were exposed to water while buried under the rubble must remain frozen for months before being dried .
this is the only way to prevent mold from forming . max plassman , one of four main archivists responsible for the preservation of the recovered documents , said this process would be unthinkable without the help of volunteers . " we have to stress the fact that most of the work here is done by volunteers , " he said .
" it is a very important fact for us , because we could n't handle this process on our own .
they are turning up daily by the hundreds here .
it 's unbelievable . " crucial to the rhineland the efforts to preserve the documents of cologne 's archive are really efforts to preserve cologne 's history , which dates back to the roman empire . for the historians of the rhineland , the archive collapse is especially devastating .
for the region 's universities , the preservation of recovered documents is absolutely critical . " you have to understand that the history of our region , the rhineland , is influenced very much by cologne , which was and is the largest city in the area , " said andreas rutz , an assistant professor of history at the university of bonn . " we have a number of phd students working on cologne subjects .
they 're writing their dissertations on the history of cologne .
for them above all it 's a big catastrophe .
they have no chance of actually finishing their dissertations the way they planned to .

"
the man was reacting to a new york times newspaper report on monday , which said us big-three carmaker gm may undergo what it called a " surgical " bankruptcy as early as june 1 .
carl-peter forster , the head of gm europe , also said a possible bankruptcy at gm posed no danger to opel .
" our production and the sale of cars in europe wo n't be affected , " he said .
and , the head of the works council at the opel plant in eisenach , germany , harald lieske , added his voice to those assuring calm .

the idea is to effectuate a " surgical bankruptcy , " which would divide gm 's " good " assets from its unhealthy ones .

franz muentefering , chairman of the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- party which shares power with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the chancellor would have to consider taking a stake in opel if other rescue efforts failed .
in an interview with bild am sonntag newspaper , muentefering said there were 25,000 jobs at stake and the company was too important to simply let it fail if no investor was found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering says the state may have to step in for opel " frau merkel will not be able to continue refusing state participation in opel if that turns out to be the only way to rescue opel , " said muentefering , who added that he and his party also would prefer a private investor taking a stake in opel .
" there are too many jobs on the line , " said muentefering .
the spd chairman also pointed out that leaders of four german states where opel plants are based have also signalled that a government rescue can not be ruled out .
they include three cdu state premiers - roland koch of hesse , juergen ruettgers of north rhine-westphalia and dieter althaus of thuringia - as well as spd state premier kurt beck in rhineland-palatinate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 13.04.2009 german bishop : atheism responsible for nazis and mass murder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop mixa has made controversial comments on several occasions a german bishop has told his easter congregation that mass murder and other crimes committed by the nazis are evidence that atheism is inhumane .
his comments have caused outraged among german atheist organizations . " without god , everything is permitted . "
with this famous quote from russian writer fyodor dostoyevsky , the bishop of the southern bavarian town of augsburg wanted to warn his congregation of what he sees as the dangers of atheism .
bishop mixa told churchgoers that a society without god was " hell on earth " and could result in bloody regimes such as those led by adolf hitler or the soviet union .
" decades past have proven the inhumanity of atheism through the godless regimes of national socialism and communism , with their penal camps , secret police and mass murder , " he said .
" wherever god is denied or fought against , there , humans and their dignity will also be denied and violated , " he added .
falsification of history rudolf ladwig , the head of german atheist organization ibka , said bishop mixa 's comments were completely " untenable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six million jews are believed to have died during wwii ladwig told german news magazine spiegel that mixa 's comments were part of a long-running strategy by the church to incorrectly rewrite its own historical dealings with fascism .
" resistance from the church -lsb- to national socialism -rsb- only came from individuals , " he said .
bishop mixa was also criticized by michael schmidt-salomon from the giordano bruno foundation , a german organization in support of evolutionary humanism .
schmidt-salomon told spiegel the argument that national socialism was godless was a " grand falsification . "
" evidence shows that the majority of the nazi elite considered themselves christian , " schmidt-salomon said .
a history of controversial comments bishop mixa is known in germany as being outspoken and has ruffled feathers on more than one occasion .
in just one example in february , mixa compared the number of jews murdered by the nazis to the number of abortions over the past few decades .
he also upset politicians two years ago when he criticized government plans to expand childcare facilities in germany .
mixa said the plans used federal aid to entice women to entrust their children to state care shortly after birth , degrading women to " birthing machines . " ca / ncy , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his comments have caused outraged among german atheist organizations . " without god , everything is permitted . "
with this famous quote from russian writer fyodor dostoyevsky , the bishop of the southern bavarian town of augsburg wanted to warn his congregation of what he sees as the dangers of atheism .
bishop mixa told churchgoers that a society without god was " hell on earth " and could result in bloody regimes such as those led by adolf hitler or the soviet union .
" decades past have proven the inhumanity of atheism through the godless regimes of national socialism and communism , with their penal camps , secret police and mass murder , " he said .
" wherever god is denied or fought against , there , humans and their dignity will also be denied and violated , " he added .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six million jews are believed to have died during wwii ladwig told german news magazine spiegel that mixa 's comments were part of a long-running strategy by the church to incorrectly rewrite its own historical dealings with fascism .
" resistance from the church -lsb- to national socialism -rsb- only came from individuals , " he said .
bishop mixa was also criticized by michael schmidt-salomon from the giordano bruno foundation , a german organization in support of evolutionary humanism .
schmidt-salomon told spiegel the argument that national socialism was godless was a " grand falsification . "
" evidence shows that the majority of the nazi elite considered themselves christian , " schmidt-salomon said .
a history of controversial comments bishop mixa is known in germany as being outspoken and has ruffled feathers on more than one occasion .
in just one example in february , mixa compared the number of jews murdered by the nazis to the number of abortions over the past few decades .
he also upset politicians two years ago when he criticized government plans to expand childcare facilities in germany .

about half of the documents have been pulled from the rubble , but now more work must be done to preserve the material . for the past several weeks , more than 60 firemen and volunteers have been spending most of their days at the site where the archive once stood .
with scoops , cranes and even their bare hands , they search through the rubble not for bodies , but for paper . that is because the documented history of the entire region now lays buried under 60 tons of rock and other debris . " today we just found a document from the 11th century , " said cologne fireman thomas buergermann .
" this is what we are doing , looking and searching for archival material , 12 hours a day every day , with the exception of sunday . " since the collapse of the archive building on march 3 , workers have been present at the site .
they plan to stay until the last document has been uncovered . " we 'll do this job until the last historical items have been found , said johannes feirer , cologne 's deputy fire chief .
" i think that we have already recovered more than half of the historical materials , " he said .
bildunterschrift : workers and volunteers have been at the site non-stop a " safe haven " for uncovered documents the archive materials are being brought to a furniture warehouse located about 20 kilometers outside of cologne .
as soon as the firemen find something they believe to be of significance , they record exactly where in the rubble they found the item , pack it in a box , and ship it to the furniture warehouse in porz , one of the city 's suburbs . in the long halls of the warehouse , there are hundreds of boxes full of random parchments , scrolls , papers , and books .
some are clean and dry , others dirty and wet .
dressed in white plastic suits and wearing hoods and protective masks , archivists , restorers , and volunteers from the rhineland and beyond have come here to begin the mindboggling task of preserving and organizing the recovered materials . the archivists and restorers are especially concerned with water-damaged documents .
for once the document begins to mold , the chance of preserving it is next to none .
archivists use dry ice to freeze documents before they can begin the long process of being restored . documents that were exposed to water while buried under the rubble must remain frozen for months before being dried .
this is the only way to prevent mold from forming . max plassman , one of four main archivists responsible for the preservation of the recovered documents , said this process would be unthinkable without the help of volunteers . " we have to stress the fact that most of the work here is done by volunteers , " he said .
" it is a very important fact for us , because we could n't handle this process on our own .
they are turning up daily by the hundreds here .
it 's unbelievable . " crucial to the rhineland the efforts to preserve the documents of cologne 's archive are really efforts to preserve cologne 's history , which dates back to the roman empire . for the historians of the rhineland , the archive collapse is especially devastating .
for the region 's universities , the preservation of recovered documents is absolutely critical . " you have to understand that the history of our region , the rhineland , is influenced very much by cologne , which was and is the largest city in the area , " said andreas rutz , an assistant professor of history at the university of bonn . " we have a number of phd students working on cologne subjects .

about half of the documents have been pulled from the rubble , but now more work must be done to preserve the material . for the past several weeks , more than 60 firemen and volunteers have been spending most of their days at the site where the archive once stood .
with scoops , cranes and even their bare hands , they search through the rubble not for bodies , but for paper . that is because the documented history of the entire region now lays buried under 60 tons of rock and other debris . " today we just found a document from the 11th century , " said cologne fireman thomas buergermann .
" this is what we are doing , looking and searching for archival material , 12 hours a day every day , with the exception of sunday . " since the collapse of the archive building on march 3 , workers have been present at the site .
they plan to stay until the last document has been uncovered . " we 'll do this job until the last historical items have been found , said johannes feirer , cologne 's deputy fire chief .
" i think that we have already recovered more than half of the historical materials , " he said .
bildunterschrift : workers and volunteers have been at the site non-stop a " safe haven " for uncovered documents the archive materials are being brought to a furniture warehouse located about 20 kilometers outside of cologne .
as soon as the firemen find something they believe to be of significance , they record exactly where in the rubble they found the item , pack it in a box , and ship it to the furniture warehouse in porz , one of the city 's suburbs . in the long halls of the warehouse , there are hundreds of boxes full of random parchments , scrolls , papers , and books .
some are clean and dry , others dirty and wet .
dressed in white plastic suits and wearing hoods and protective masks , archivists , restorers , and volunteers from the rhineland and beyond have come here to begin the mindboggling task of preserving and organizing the recovered materials . the archivists and restorers are especially concerned with water-damaged documents .
for once the document begins to mold , the chance of preserving it is next to none .
archivists use dry ice to freeze documents before they can begin the long process of being restored . documents that were exposed to water while buried under the rubble must remain frozen for months before being dried .
this is the only way to prevent mold from forming . max plassman , one of four main archivists responsible for the preservation of the recovered documents , said this process would be unthinkable without the help of volunteers . " we have to stress the fact that most of the work here is done by volunteers , " he said .
" it is a very important fact for us , because we could n't handle this process on our own .
they are turning up daily by the hundreds here .
it 's unbelievable . " crucial to the rhineland the efforts to preserve the documents of cologne 's archive are really efforts to preserve cologne 's history , which dates back to the roman empire . for the historians of the rhineland , the archive collapse is especially devastating .
for the region 's universities , the preservation of recovered documents is absolutely critical . " you have to understand that the history of our region , the rhineland , is influenced very much by cologne , which was and is the largest city in the area , " said andreas rutz , an assistant professor of history at the university of bonn . " we have a number of phd students working on cologne subjects .
they 're writing their dissertations on the history of cologne .
for them above all it 's a big catastrophe .
they have no chance of actually finishing their dissertations the way they planned to .
so for them it would be great , if these things were found .
because then they would be able to continue . " author : gabriel borrud editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said scores of people were wounded as troops enforcing a state of emergency clashed with protesters . police estimated that up to 30,000 red-shirted anti-government protesters had gathered around the capital , bangkok , on sunday . in a telephone address to protesters gathered outside the prime minister 's offices , thaksin attacked the government 's response to the demonstrations , and held out the possibility of returning to thailand to lead the protesters ' movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaksin is wanted in thailand on corruption charges " now that they have tanks on the streets , it is time for the people to come out in revolution , " he said .
" and when it is necessary , i will come back to the country .
let us be strong to fight for true democracy for our people . " thaksin , who has been living in exile since a coup forced him from power in 2006 , said the protests were a " golden opportunity " to dislodge the current government , which he described as illegitimate . he also thanked soldiers who refused to enforce the government 's emergency measures and urged the military to join the so-called " red shirt " movement to oust prime minister abhisit vejjajiva .

abhisit managed to escape the complex by car after soldiers guarding him fired shots in the air to keep demonstrators at bay .
in a tv address , abhisit said the nation was " in danger " because of unreasonable , self-serving people .
government officials said soldiers and armored vehicles had been deployed to secure public buildings , intersections and public transportation at 50 locations throughout the city .
authorities did not say how long the state of emergency would be in force , but abhisit said the next three to four days would be " crucial to returning to peace . "

" however , we will show that we have integrity and character and do our best to give the people a champions league game . "
klinsmann admitted the defeat had been a blow for him but said he never thought of quitting his post .
" i 've had extreme moments before .
three months before the world cup , we went down 4-1 to italy and then went on to have a summer fairy tale , " said the 44-year-old in reference to germany 's run to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup on home soil .

they are also still in the spanish cup .
" we are close to three titles and do n't want to let any of them escape us , " said playmaker xavi .

" franck wants to play for barcelona , " bayern skipper mark van bommel told spain 's rac-1 radio on monday , in comments that will hardly go down well with the bayern board , who are desperate to hold on to their prize asset .

but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .
“ we 're from the generation that has known war , ” one older woman said .
“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .
the german easter march movement , which began as an echo of an anti-nuclear march led by bertrand russell in london , started in 1960 , meaning the 2010 marching season will be the movement 's 50th . mrh / jen , dpa / epd / wdr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .

the business model is seen to provide stability and security in tough times . already established in the banking and agricultural sectors , cooperatives in germany are beginning to expand to other fields as small and medium-sized enterprises look for security during the ongoing economic crisis . " we even notice new fields of activity like health care and the energy sector , " said eckhard ott , head of the german cooperative and raiffeisen confederation -lrb- dgrv -rrb- .
" due to the hard economic situation of many suppliers in the healthcare sector , medics and health care networks are founded as cooperatives . " cooperative members retain ownership of their individual businesses but benefit from being able to cooperate to increase profitability by negotiating better prices from suppliers , develop new business opportunities and share risk for large projects they may have otherwise been wary of taking on . " the decision to run the business as a cooperative was the result of a longer process with the intention to reorganize marketing and sales and increase knowledge exchange , " said dirk lukas , a spokesman for the buso cooperative for the solar heating industry . many reasons to form a co-op bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cooperatives have expanded to encompass the solar energy sector lukas said the cooperative model allowed the group 's 130 members to handle growing demand for their products with a system that meets the needs of manufacturers and installers who may not have otherwise been able to engage in large , profitable projects . germany is home to around 8,000 cooperatives with roughly 20 million members .
with 250 co-ops created last year , the number of cooperatives formed in germany has almost doubled in comparison to 2007 .
part of the renewed interest in the business model is due to a 2006 legal amendment making the associations easier to form , ott said . " new cooperatives now have the possibility to promote cultural or social objects , " he said , adding that it takes just three people to form a cooperative .
" that makes cooperatives attractive for cultural and social ventures like hospitals , senior citizen homes , cinemas , theaters or even indoor swimming pools . " the economic security provided by cooperatives also entices businesses to form cooperatives .
while the most recent data from the german statistics office shows about one percent of all german businesses were declared insolvent in 2005 , less than 0.1 percent of german cooperatives went bankrupt in 2008 , lukas said . " the cooperative structure is very safe in terms of economic ups and downs , " he added . author : steffen marquardt / sean sinico editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the goal now : saving face . bayern munich president franz beckenbauer described the first half of the game in barcelona , when lionel messi scored twice and thierry henry and samuel eto 'o also got on the scoresheet , as the worst half of football he had ever seen played by a bayern team .
there were calls in some quarters for the dismissal of coach jurgen klinsmann but the pressure on the former germany boss has abated somewhat in the wake of a 4-0 demolition of eintracht frankfurt in the bundesliga at the weekend .
on tuesday , the team will be playing mostly for pride .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer said the first leg was the worst he had ever seen " we are not going to beat them by four goals , that 's clear to us , " said klinsmann .
" however , we will show that we have integrity and character and do our best to give the people a champions league game . "
klinsmann admitted the defeat had been a blow for him but said he never thought of quitting his post .
" i 've had extreme moments before .
three months before the world cup , we went down 4-1 to italy and then went on to have a summer fairy tale , " said the 44-year-old in reference to germany 's run to the semi-finals of the 2006 world cup on home soil .
klinsi : ' i will see this through ' however , chants calling for klinsmann 's removal could be heard from the stands during bayern 's victory over frankfurt .
the coach said they would not affect him .
" we are putting everything into bayern every day and i am going to see this through , " said klinsmann .
barcelona coach josep guardiola , who will have to watch his 50th competitive game in charge of the catalan giants from the stands of the allianz arena after being sent off in the first leg , is expected to rest several key players against the german champions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should frenchman ribery go to barca ?
messi and henry , who tormented bayern a week ago , are expected to start on the bench while defender rafael marquez is expected to remain in barcelona after picking up a yellow card in the first leg .
as well as performing strongly in europe , barca currently top the primera liga and maintained their six-point lead over real madrid with a 2-0 victory over recreativo de huelva on saturday .
they are also still in the spanish cup .
" we are close to three titles and do n't want to let any of them escape us , " said playmaker xavi .
captain says ribery should go meanwhile bayern munich 's french midfielder franck ribery has been told by his own captain that he should join barcelona next season .
" franck wants to play for barcelona , " bayern skipper mark van bommel told spain 's rac-1 radio on monday , in comments that will hardly go down well with the bayern board , who are desperate to hold on to their prize asset .
" more than that , i think it would be a good thing if barca buys him , he would adapt easily , " said the dutchman , who won a champions league title with barcelona in 2006 . jen , ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about half of the documents have been pulled from the rubble , but now more work must be done to preserve the material . for the past several weeks , more than 60 firemen and volunteers have been spending most of their days at the site where the archive once stood .
with scoops , cranes and even their bare hands , they search through the rubble not for bodies , but for paper . that is because the documented history of the entire region now lays buried under 60 tons of rock and other debris . " today we just found a document from the 11th century , " said cologne fireman thomas buergermann .
" this is what we are doing , looking and searching for archival material , 12 hours a day every day , with the exception of sunday . " since the collapse of the archive building on march 3 , workers have been present at the site .
they plan to stay until the last document has been uncovered . " we 'll do this job until the last historical items have been found , said johannes feirer , cologne 's deputy fire chief .
" i think that we have already recovered more than half of the historical materials , " he said .
bildunterschrift : workers and volunteers have been at the site non-stop a " safe haven " for uncovered documents the archive materials are being brought to a furniture warehouse located about 20 kilometers outside of cologne .
as soon as the firemen find something they believe to be of significance , they record exactly where in the rubble they found the item , pack it in a box , and ship it to the furniture warehouse in porz , one of the city 's suburbs . in the long halls of the warehouse , there are hundreds of boxes full of random parchments , scrolls , papers , and books .
some are clean and dry , others dirty and wet .
dressed in white plastic suits and wearing hoods and protective masks , archivists , restorers , and volunteers from the rhineland and beyond have come here to begin the mindboggling task of preserving and organizing the recovered materials . the archivists and restorers are especially concerned with water-damaged documents .
for once the document begins to mold , the chance of preserving it is next to none .
archivists use dry ice to freeze documents before they can begin the long process of being restored . documents that were exposed to water while buried under the rubble must remain frozen for months before being dried .
this is the only way to prevent mold from forming . max plassman , one of four main archivists responsible for the preservation of the recovered documents , said this process would be unthinkable without the help of volunteers . " we have to stress the fact that most of the work here is done by volunteers , " he said .
" it is a very important fact for us , because we could n't handle this process on our own .
they are turning up daily by the hundreds here .
it 's unbelievable . " crucial to the rhineland the efforts to preserve the documents of cologne 's archive are really efforts to preserve cologne 's history , which dates back to the roman empire . for the historians of the rhineland , the archive collapse is especially devastating .
for the region 's universities , the preservation of recovered documents is absolutely critical . " you have to understand that the history of our region , the rhineland , is influenced very much by cologne , which was and is the largest city in the area , " said andreas rutz , an assistant professor of history at the university of bonn . " we have a number of phd students working on cologne subjects .
they 're writing their dissertations on the history of cologne .
for them above all it 's a big catastrophe .
they have no chance of actually finishing their dissertations the way they planned to .
so for them it would be great , if these things were found .

officials said scores of people were wounded as troops enforcing a state of emergency clashed with protesters . police estimated that up to 30,000 red-shirted anti-government protesters had gathered around the capital , bangkok , on sunday . in a telephone address to protesters gathered outside the prime minister 's offices , thaksin attacked the government 's response to the demonstrations , and held out the possibility of returning to thailand to lead the protesters ' movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaksin is wanted in thailand on corruption charges " now that they have tanks on the streets , it is time for the people to come out in revolution , " he said .
" and when it is necessary , i will come back to the country .
let us be strong to fight for true democracy for our people . " thaksin , who has been living in exile since a coup forced him from power in 2006 , said the protests were a " golden opportunity " to dislodge the current government , which he described as illegitimate . he also thanked soldiers who refused to enforce the government 's emergency measures and urged the military to join the so-called " red shirt " movement to oust prime minister abhisit vejjajiva .

abhisit managed to escape the complex by car after soldiers guarding him fired shots in the air to keep demonstrators at bay .
in a tv address , abhisit said the nation was " in danger " because of unreasonable , self-serving people .
government officials said soldiers and armored vehicles had been deployed to secure public buildings , intersections and public transportation at 50 locations throughout the city .
authorities did not say how long the state of emergency would be in force , but abhisit said the next three to four days would be " crucial to returning to peace . "
the measure bans public gatherings of more than five people and allows security forces to detain suspects for up to 30 days without charge .

officials said scores of people were wounded as troops enforcing a state of emergency clashed with protesters . police estimated that up to 30,000 red-shirted anti-government protesters had gathered around the capital , bangkok , on sunday . in a telephone address to protesters gathered outside the prime minister 's offices , thaksin attacked the government 's response to the demonstrations , and held out the possibility of returning to thailand to lead the protesters ' movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaksin is wanted in thailand on corruption charges " now that they have tanks on the streets , it is time for the people to come out in revolution , " he said .
" and when it is necessary , i will come back to the country .
let us be strong to fight for true democracy for our people . " thaksin , who has been living in exile since a coup forced him from power in 2006 , said the protests were a " golden opportunity " to dislodge the current government , which he described as illegitimate . he also thanked soldiers who refused to enforce the government 's emergency measures and urged the military to join the so-called " red shirt " movement to oust prime minister abhisit vejjajiva . " the troops who have already come out can come and join the red shirts to help us to get democracy for the people , " he said . state of emergency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors want to see the current prime minister gone earlier , the thai government declared a state of emergency in bangkok and surrounding areas after protesters forced the cancellation of an association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- summit on saturday . the announcement came as hundreds of protesters stormed the interior ministry , demanding premier abhisit vejjajiva 's resigantion .
abhisit managed to escape the complex by car after soldiers guarding him fired shots in the air to keep demonstrators at bay .
in a tv address , abhisit said the nation was " in danger " because of unreasonable , self-serving people .
government officials said soldiers and armored vehicles had been deployed to secure public buildings , intersections and public transportation at 50 locations throughout the city .
authorities did not say how long the state of emergency would be in force , but abhisit said the next three to four days would be " crucial to returning to peace . "
the measure bans public gatherings of more than five people and allows security forces to detain suspects for up to 30 days without charge .
officials can also enforce strict controls on media and all other forms of communication .
this is the third time a state of emergency has been called in the capital since september 2008 .
thai police arrest protest leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protest leader arisman pongreungrong may be feeling less victorious after his arrest the interior ministry was stormed after thai police arrested the leader of saturday 's anti-government protests .
arisman pongruengrong 's arrest came as the prime minister promised to take legal action against thaksin 's supporters .
in his weekly televised address to the nation , abhisit described the protesters as " enemies of thailand " and vowed to bring order and peace back to the divided country .
ongoing uncertainty thaksin 's supporters are demanding abhisit 's resignation and new elections just four months after he took office .
abhisit was installed as prime minister in a parliamentary vote after a court ruling removed thaksin 's allies from power in response to anti-thaksin protesters occupying two thai airports for a week .
four prime ministers over the last 15 months have failed in their attempts to stabilize the country and saturday 's dramatic evacuation of foreign leaders from the asean summit venue by helicopter is another embarrassment for the thai government .
ahead of the summit , the thai government had given assurances that it would take whatever measures necessary to prevent such a situation .
officials have now acknowledged that security forces had failed to do just that .
missed opportunities at cancelled summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao was meant to announce a multi-billion dollar investment fund at the summit the summit was meant to bring together southeast asian leaders with ministers from china , south korea , japan , india , australia and new zealand and un secretary general ban ki-moon to discuss the global financial crisis and north korea 's recent rocket launch .
asian leaders were also expected to sign an investment pact with china .
china has announced an offer of $ 15 billion in credit to asean countries and a $ 10 billion infrastructure investment fund .
the asean meeting had already been delayed by previous clashes between anti-government and pro-government supporters .
thai officials now say talks will be held in about two months ' time . sje / pfd / tt , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his comments have caused outraged among german atheist organizations . " without god , everything is permitted . "
with this famous quote from russian writer fyodor dostoyevsky , the bishop of the southern bavarian town of augsburg wanted to warn his congregation of what he sees as the dangers of atheism .
bishop mixa told churchgoers that a society without god was " hell on earth " and could result in bloody regimes such as those led by adolf hitler or the soviet union .
" decades past have proven the inhumanity of atheism through the godless regimes of national socialism and communism , with their penal camps , secret police and mass murder , " he said .
" wherever god is denied or fought against , there , humans and their dignity will also be denied and violated , " he added .
falsification of history rudolf ladwig , the head of german atheist organization ibka , said bishop mixa 's comments were completely " untenable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six million jews are believed to have died during wwii ladwig told german news magazine spiegel that mixa 's comments were part of a long-running strategy by the church to incorrectly rewrite its own historical dealings with fascism .
" resistance from the church -lsb- to national socialism -rsb- only came from individuals , " he said .
bishop mixa was also criticized by michael schmidt-salomon from the giordano bruno foundation , a german organization in support of evolutionary humanism .
schmidt-salomon told spiegel the argument that national socialism was godless was a " grand falsification . "
" evidence shows that the majority of the nazi elite considered themselves christian , " schmidt-salomon said .
a history of controversial comments bishop mixa is known in germany as being outspoken and has ruffled feathers on more than one occasion .
in just one example in february , mixa compared the number of jews murdered by the nazis to the number of abortions over the past few decades .
he also upset politicians two years ago when he criticized government plans to expand childcare facilities in germany .
mixa said the plans used federal aid to entice women to entrust their children to state care shortly after birth , degrading women to " birthing machines . " ca / ncy , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .

“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .

“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .

a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .

“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .
the german easter march movement , which began as an echo of an anti-nuclear march led by bertrand russell in london , started in 1960 , meaning the 2010 marching season will be the movement 's 50th . mrh / jen , dpa / epd / wdr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu 's czech presidency called on protesters " to refrain from further violent action , " adding that they only risked harming " the stability and the reputation of their country . ”

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest claimed the lives of two people on tuesday locals take up arms thai hospital officials say two people have been killed , and over 100 injured , in political violence on the streets of bangkok .
the government said the deaths occurred when red-clad demonstrators clashed with local residents , who had armed themselves and set up roadblocks to counter the protesters near government house , the seat of thai government .
elsewhere , anti-government protesters clashed with security forces , leaving over 20 troops injured , and set fire to a government ministry with molotov cocktails . making it clear they were prepared for a " final stand , " the so-called red shirt protesters later retreated to their camp near the offices of prime minister abhisit , just one day after the embattled premier imposed a state of emergency in the capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have used live munition to disperse protesters abhisit warns protesters " those who want to help the government restore normality can return home , " abhisit said in a televised address .
" the government has carefully mapped out a plan to implement the law . "
abhisit is under intense pressure after the red shirts stormed the venue of an asian summit on saturday .
the summit had to be postponed as leaders abandoned the venue , some by helicopter .
the unrest moved on to bangkok on sunday , when demonstrators attacked a convoy carrying abhisit out of the interior ministry .
much of the city was shut down on monday for the thai new year holiday of songkran .
military to restore order by all means supreme military commander songkitti jaggabatara has , meanwhile , pledged to restore order using " all possible means . ”
his troops would not instigate violence , he said , but they did reserve the right to self-defense if attacked .
thailand has been caught up in turmoil ever since the military toppled prime minister thaksin shinawatra in a coup in 2006 .
the protesters want abhisit , who only took office in december , to step down , saying he came to power through an undemocratic parliamentary vote following a court ruling that drove thaksin 's allies from power . db / jen , ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

franz muentefering , chairman of the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- party which shares power with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the chancellor would have to consider taking a stake in opel if other rescue efforts failed .
in an interview with bild am sonntag newspaper , muentefering said there were 25,000 jobs at stake and the company was too important to simply let it fail if no investor was found .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.04.2009 easter marches march on ... or is that limping ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those rainbows stand for peace leaders of germany ’ s peace movement were talking up the positives from this year ’ s more than 70 easter marches nationwide .
but others noted that while there were a lot of marches , few of them drew many people . easter weekend , for germans of a certain political bent , means participating in easter marches .
over the five decades germans have made easter a time for marching for peace , participants have focused on a number of targets : protesting the stationing of nuclear warheads in the country , stopping the spread of nuclear power , preventing the spread of conflict in the middle east .
this year 's marches centered on criticizing nato strategy in afghanistan -lrb- especially the presence of german troops there -rrb- , the stalled peace process between israelis and palestinians , and the dream of a nuclear weapon-free world , which was recently rekindled by comments from us president barack obama .
according to march organizers , those causes brought out more than 20,000 germans over this easter weekend - a sum they considered a positive turnout .
dwindling attendance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the marchers say ' no ' to war , nato and nuclear weapons but others found the numbers less rosy .
a single protest , in fretzdorf , northwest of berlin , made up more than 10,000 of the weekend total , meaning elbow room at the other 70-odd marches was significantly easier to come by .
protests in berlin and dusseldorf drew about 500 people each , while munich 's march was an even smaller party of 300 .
moreover , the fretzdorf march , in the eastern state of brandenburg , was driven as much by a not-in-my-backyard impulse as by a concern for world peace .
the ministry of defense wants to reopen a soviet-era proving ground there that would give air force planes a place to practice low-flying bombing runs .
locals have dubbed the planned facility the ‘ bombodrome ' and are mostly against it .
“ we 're from the generation that has known war , ” one older woman said .
“ there will always be an anti-war faction among us , until we die . ”
another local man said , “ would you want to live here , when airplanes are constantly buzzing overhead ? ”
motivation needed organizers might have hoped for more people to come out and march for world peace , but they were n't expecting too many .
last year 's easter march numbers were also fairly small , and many say it 's natural for numbers to fluctuate , depending on the perceived urgency of peace as a political issue .
“ afghanistan just seems very far away for a lot of people , ” says manfred stenner , the director of the coperative peace network in bonn .
but he says too that recent polls have shown that a wide majority of germans are against having their troops in afghanistan .
“ we see ourselves as representative of that opinion , ” he said .
that situation might change , or another potential conflict could push peace to the forefront , where it was in past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1983 , protests brought the people out “ it 's natural to have fewer people come out now , compared with the 1980s , ” said stenner .
“ that was right at the high point of the cold war , when nuclear war could have broken out at any time , and almost did . ”
the early 1980s saw a string of anti-nuclear protests in germany that drew hundreds of thousands , culminating in one in germany 's then-capital bonn in 1983 that drew half a million by some estimates .
that sort of an attendance figure was matched only once since – in berlin in 2003 , against the iraq war , which was approaching at the time .
organizers will be hoping for a much bigger turnout next year .
the german easter march movement , which began as an echo of an anti-nuclear march led by bertrand russell in london , started in 1960 , meaning the 2010 marching season will be the movement 's 50th . mrh / jen , dpa / epd / wdr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the taliban have carried out similar assassinations in kandahar in recent years .

taliban members also sprayed acid into the faces of schoolgirls in kandahar in november last year .

" decades past have proven the inhumanity of atheism through the godless regimes of national socialism and communism , with their penal camps , secret police and mass murder , " he said .

his comments have caused outraged among german atheist organizations . " without god , everything is permitted . "
with this famous quote from russian writer fyodor dostoyevsky , the bishop of the southern bavarian town of augsburg wanted to warn his congregation of what he sees as the dangers of atheism .
bishop mixa told churchgoers that a society without god was " hell on earth " and could result in bloody regimes such as those led by adolf hitler or the soviet union .
" decades past have proven the inhumanity of atheism through the godless regimes of national socialism and communism , with their penal camps , secret police and mass murder , " he said .
" wherever god is denied or fought against , there , humans and their dignity will also be denied and violated , " he added .

in just one example in february , mixa compared the number of jews murdered by the nazis to the number of abortions over the past few decades .
he also upset politicians two years ago when he criticized government plans to expand childcare facilities in germany .

according to iran 's isna news agency , jalili , who is a top official at iran 's supreme national security council , spoke to solana on the telephone .
isna on monday quoted jalili as saying that tehran would soon declare its official stance on the matter .
in brussels , a spokeswoman for solana confirmed that he and jalili " had a constructive conversation , " and " agreed to remain in contact . "
last wednesday , the five permanent members of the un security council - the united states , britain , russia , china , and france - together with germany tasked solana with inviting iran to discuss its nuclear program .
the west suspects tehran is secretly making atomic weapons and has repeatedly called on the country to stop its uranium enrichment program .
iran says its nuclear program is designed purely for generating electricity .
a new beginning on the persian new year day , us president barack obama advocated a " new beginning " in the relationship between the arch-foes , marking a major shift in us policy under the new administration .
while inaugurating iran 's first nuclear fuel plant last week , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said the islamic republic would be ready for talks with the west if they were based on respect and justice .
in washington , state department spokesman robert wood repeated the us offer to hold talks with iran without any preconditions , but said iran needed to show the international community that its nuclear program is a peaceful one .

"
the man was reacting to a new york times newspaper report on monday , which said us big-three carmaker gm may undergo what it called a " surgical " bankruptcy as early as june 1 .

and , the head of the works council at the opel plant in eisenach , germany , harald lieske , added his voice to those assuring calm .

about half of the documents have been pulled from the rubble , but now more work must be done to preserve the material . for the past several weeks , more than 60 firemen and volunteers have been spending most of their days at the site where the archive once stood .
with scoops , cranes and even their bare hands , they search through the rubble not for bodies , but for paper . that is because the documented history of the entire region now lays buried under 60 tons of rock and other debris . " today we just found a document from the 11th century , " said cologne fireman thomas buergermann .
" this is what we are doing , looking and searching for archival material , 12 hours a day every day , with the exception of sunday . " since the collapse of the archive building on march 3 , workers have been present at the site .
they plan to stay until the last document has been uncovered . " we 'll do this job until the last historical items have been found , said johannes feirer , cologne 's deputy fire chief .
" i think that we have already recovered more than half of the historical materials , " he said .
bildunterschrift : workers and volunteers have been at the site non-stop a " safe haven " for uncovered documents the archive materials are being brought to a furniture warehouse located about 20 kilometers outside of cologne .
as soon as the firemen find something they believe to be of significance , they record exactly where in the rubble they found the item , pack it in a box , and ship it to the furniture warehouse in porz , one of the city 's suburbs . in the long halls of the warehouse , there are hundreds of boxes full of random parchments , scrolls , papers , and books .
some are clean and dry , others dirty and wet .
dressed in white plastic suits and wearing hoods and protective masks , archivists , restorers , and volunteers from the rhineland and beyond have come here to begin the mindboggling task of preserving and organizing the recovered materials . the archivists and restorers are especially concerned with water-damaged documents .
for once the document begins to mold , the chance of preserving it is next to none .
archivists use dry ice to freeze documents before they can begin the long process of being restored . documents that were exposed to water while buried under the rubble must remain frozen for months before being dried .
this is the only way to prevent mold from forming . max plassman , one of four main archivists responsible for the preservation of the recovered documents , said this process would be unthinkable without the help of volunteers . " we have to stress the fact that most of the work here is done by volunteers , " he said .
" it is a very important fact for us , because we could n't handle this process on our own .
they are turning up daily by the hundreds here .
it 's unbelievable . " crucial to the rhineland the efforts to preserve the documents of cologne 's archive are really efforts to preserve cologne 's history , which dates back to the roman empire . for the historians of the rhineland , the archive collapse is especially devastating .
for the region 's universities , the preservation of recovered documents is absolutely critical . " you have to understand that the history of our region , the rhineland , is influenced very much by cologne , which was and is the largest city in the area , " said andreas rutz , an assistant professor of history at the university of bonn . " we have a number of phd students working on cologne subjects .
they 're writing their dissertations on the history of cologne .
for them above all it 's a big catastrophe .
they have no chance of actually finishing their dissertations the way they planned to .
so for them it would be great , if these things were found .
because then they would be able to continue . " author : gabriel borrud editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under a 30-day state of emergency , newspapers and broadcasters are not allowed to carry stories critical of the army 's grip on power in fiji .
army chief commodore frank bainimarama has been reinstated as prime minister .
he regained office after the president scrapped the constitution and dismissed the judges who had declared the military government to be illegal .
editors at fiji 's newspapers as well as its television and radio stations have been ordered not to publish or broadcast any material that shows the military in a bad light .
journalists must submit any sensitive stories to government officials for approval .
should these directives be ignored then media organisations could be shut down .
defiance there has been some attempt by newspapers and broadcasters to voice their displeasure .
the fiji times left one of its pages blank except for a message which said that that certain stories could not be printed because of government regulations .
fiji television 's main evening news bulletin was cancelled in protest at the restrictions .
it was replaced by a programme about fishing .
the fiji media council said the censorship of the press was a tragedy for a country where free and vigorous reporting has become a proud tradition .
fiji has been run by its army chief , commodore frank bainimarama , since december 2006 , when troops ousted an elected government that senior officers said was corrupt and discriminating against the ethnic indian minority .
last week , the military take-over was declared illegal by the country 's court of appeal , which prompted commodore bainimarama to step down as interim prime minister .
fiji 's president , ratu josefa iloilo , who is a loyal supporter of the armed forces commander , responded by scrapping the constitution and dismissing the judiciary .
the military administration was reinstated , its grip on power now stronger than ever .
