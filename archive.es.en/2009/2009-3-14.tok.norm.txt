" i 'm very positive , i 'm very optimistic that we will be able to come to an agreement together with the united states , with emerging economies such as china and india , " she said saturday , march 14 .
" we have to come up with substantive results . " merkel added that the summit would " be a positive signal to the world that we want to promote growth . " brown also voiced confidence , saying the london summit would seek to agree on reshaping the international regulatory system .
" you 'll see massive change in the supervisory system , " he said . " it 's going to include tax and regulatory havens where it did n't before , " he said .
" we must act to reshape the regulatory system for the new times .
regulation in one country must cooperate more closely with regulation in another country . finance minister to pave the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance ministers are trying to set the groundwork for a deal their bosses can agree to the announcements came even as finance ministers from g20 nations engaged in separate talks to set the foundations for the heads of state meeting in april . splits seemed to have emerged in the g20 with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis . contrary to a the us position of spending more on stimulus packages to revive the economy , a german-french proposal focuses on international regulation to prevent future problems . ahead of the talks , alistair darling , britain 's finance minister and host of the ministers ' meeting , said he was " quite sure " progress would be made . " we are committed to deliver the scale of sustained effort necessary to restore growth , " said a g20 statement issued after talks between finance ministers and central bankers . extra imf funding expected finance ministers , however , seemed to have papered over differences between the american and european positions and instead focused on extra funding for the international monetary fund and other international agencies that loan money to struggling countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf is hoping to have its funding doubled " we need a commitment from countries that they will do whatever is necessary and as for long as necessary to support their economies , " darling said .
" we really must take action to stop damage being done to the emerging economies , who are seeing money coming out of their systems . " the united states has suggested that the imf 's lending capacity be tripled to $ 750 billion dollars , but european g20 leaders have come out in favor of doubling the bank 's resources for $ 500 billion .
the asian development bank is also hoping for more money . " the g20 is ready to significantly increase imf resources , " a european source told reporters , speaking on condition of anonymity , adding that no announcement on the size of the increase would be made saturday . world bank chief robert zoellick , who was also present at the finance ministers ' meeting , said additional spending would only provide a short-lived " sugar high " if governments failed to rid banks of toxic assets that continue to undermine confidence , trust and the desire to lend or invest . the g20 accounts for over 80 percent of the world 's output , which is expected to shrink this year and by more than any year since the 1930s . sms / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the grand coalition has had to make some compromises but it has shown itself to be capable of acting , " he said . in a separate interview , koehler added that he saw a growing gap between the public and the politicians meant to serve it .

" there is no leave of absence for the responsibility of governing , " he told the daily ruhr nachrichten on saturday , march 14 .
" as long as the coalition is presiding , it has to go respectably about its work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler 's duties are largely symbolic , but he has engaged the government at times pointing to the current global economic crisis , koehler said the people of germany had a right to demand their leaders work in the best interest of the country - not the political parties of which they are members . the president also said opposition parties should present their alternatives to the government 's plans rather than denouncing them out of hand . though none of the parties in the ruling coalition is thrilled with the partners it 's had to work with since the last election in 2005 , koehler said the government has not fallen into disarray . " the grand coalition has had to make some compromises but it has shown itself to be capable of acting , " he said . in a separate interview , koehler added that he saw a growing gap between the public and the politicians meant to serve it . " a rift has grown between the politicians and citizens , " he said in the passauer neue presse on saturday .

" we wo n't notice anything this season , but if there is a global economic crisis then soccer wo n't escape unscathed , " he said .
" we will feel the effects and suffer a few cuts and bruises .
however , it wo n't be a major threat to the business model as it is too stable for that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss sepp blatter says soccer will eventually be affected by the crisis seifert 's words were an echo of those by world soccer chief sepp blatter , who spoke of a so-far unscathed world game at a press conference in manchester , england , on wednesday . " soccer is not too much touched by this economical tsunami , " he said .
" but you 've got to guard against the second wave . " bad news for some clubs however , there are some black clouds on the horizon .
while all 18 top bundesliga clubs registered a profit after tax in the 2006-07 business year , last year just 15 remained in the black .
in the second division the number dropped from 12 to nine . " the figures are n't as good as in 2006-07 , but are still very respectable , " said dfl finance officer christian mueller . transfer costs rose from 164.5 million euros to 192.3 million , while wages also increased by 40 percent from 530 million euros to 627 million . while the 40-percent figure is significant , it compares favorably to the english premier league and france 's top division where wages in the same period rose by 63 and 64 percent respectively . transfers hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaas-jan huntelaar , left , and arjen robben , right , are now team mates at real madrid despite the optimism in the dfl boardroom , the global economic slowdown managed to drag down activity in the january transfer window for the 2008-09 season . while english premier league clubs forked out 172 million euros for new players in the window , the top clubs from europe 's four other major leagues could n't match this amount between them . " european transfer markets as a whole have been extraordinarily quiet , and much of the activity in england has been in the form of loans and short-term contracts , " simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university , told reuters news agency . in italy , spending dropped by about 43 percent from the previous season to around 29 million euros .
german clubs meanwhile spent a little over 16 million euros for 42 player transfers . real madrid were the only primera liga club to buy big , spending around 43 million euros to sign klaas-jan huntelaar from ajax amsterdam and lassana diarra from portsmouth . dfm / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

regulation in one country must cooperate more closely with regulation in another country . finance minister to pave the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance ministers are trying to set the groundwork for a deal their bosses can agree to the announcements came even as finance ministers from g20 nations engaged in separate talks to set the foundations for the heads of state meeting in april . splits seemed to have emerged in the g20 with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis . contrary to a the us position of spending more on stimulus packages to revive the economy , a german-french proposal focuses on international regulation to prevent future problems . ahead of the talks , alistair darling , britain 's finance minister and host of the ministers ' meeting , said he was " quite sure " progress would be made . " we are committed to deliver the scale of sustained effort necessary to restore growth , " said a g20 statement issued after talks between finance ministers and central bankers . extra imf funding expected finance ministers , however , seemed to have papered over differences between the american and european positions and instead focused on extra funding for the international monetary fund and other international agencies that loan money to struggling countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf is hoping to have its funding doubled " we need a commitment from countries that they will do whatever is necessary and as for long as necessary to support their economies , " darling said .
" we really must take action to stop damage being done to the emerging economies , who are seeing money coming out of their systems . " the united states has suggested that the imf 's lending capacity be tripled to $ 750 billion dollars , but european g20 leaders have come out in favor of doubling the bank 's resources for $ 500 billion .
the asian development bank is also hoping for more money . " the g20 is ready to significantly increase imf resources , " a european source told reporters , speaking on condition of anonymity , adding that no announcement on the size of the increase would be made saturday . world bank chief robert zoellick , who was also present at the finance ministers ' meeting , said additional spending would only provide a short-lived " sugar high " if governments failed to rid banks of toxic assets that continue to undermine confidence , trust and the desire to lend or invest . the g20 accounts for over 80 percent of the world 's output , which is expected to shrink this year and by more than any year since the 1930s . sms / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we wo n't notice anything this season , but if there is a global economic crisis then soccer wo n't escape unscathed , " he said .
" we will feel the effects and suffer a few cuts and bruises .
however , it wo n't be a major threat to the business model as it is too stable for that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss sepp blatter says soccer will eventually be affected by the crisis seifert 's words were an echo of those by world soccer chief sepp blatter , who spoke of a so-far unscathed world game at a press conference in manchester , england , on wednesday . " soccer is not too much touched by this economical tsunami , " he said .
" but you 've got to guard against the second wave . " bad news for some clubs however , there are some black clouds on the horizon .
while all 18 top bundesliga clubs registered a profit after tax in the 2006-07 business year , last year just 15 remained in the black .
in the second division the number dropped from 12 to nine . " the figures are n't as good as in 2006-07 , but are still very respectable , " said dfl finance officer christian mueller . transfer costs rose from 164.5 million euros to 192.3 million , while wages also increased by 40 percent from 530 million euros to 627 million . while the 40-percent figure is significant , it compares favorably to the english premier league and france 's top division where wages in the same period rose by 63 and 64 percent respectively . transfers hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaas-jan huntelaar , left , and arjen robben , right , are now team mates at real madrid despite the optimism in the dfl boardroom , the global economic slowdown managed to drag down activity in the january transfer window for the 2008-09 season . while english premier league clubs forked out 172 million euros for new players in the window , the top clubs from europe 's four other major leagues could n't match this amount between them . " european transfer markets as a whole have been extraordinarily quiet , and much of the activity in england has been in the form of loans and short-term contracts , " simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university , told reuters news agency . in italy , spending dropped by about 43 percent from the previous season to around 29 million euros .
german clubs meanwhile spent a little over 16 million euros for 42 player transfers . real madrid were the only primera liga club to buy big , spending around 43 million euros to sign klaas-jan huntelaar from ajax amsterdam and lassana diarra from portsmouth . dfm / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we wo n't notice anything this season , but if there is a global economic crisis then soccer wo n't escape unscathed , " he said .
" we will feel the effects and suffer a few cuts and bruises .
however , it wo n't be a major threat to the business model as it is too stable for that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss sepp blatter says soccer will eventually be affected by the crisis seifert 's words were an echo of those by world soccer chief sepp blatter , who spoke of a so-far unscathed world game at a press conference in manchester , england , on wednesday . " soccer is not too much touched by this economical tsunami , " he said .
" but you 've got to guard against the second wave . " bad news for some clubs however , there are some black clouds on the horizon .
while all 18 top bundesliga clubs registered a profit after tax in the 2006-07 business year , last year just 15 remained in the black .
in the second division the number dropped from 12 to nine . " the figures are n't as good as in 2006-07 , but are still very respectable , " said dfl finance officer christian mueller . transfer costs rose from 164.5 million euros to 192.3 million , while wages also increased by 40 percent from 530 million euros to 627 million . while the 40-percent figure is significant , it compares favorably to the english premier league and france 's top division where wages in the same period rose by 63 and 64 percent respectively . transfers hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaas-jan huntelaar , left , and arjen robben , right , are now team mates at real madrid despite the optimism in the dfl boardroom , the global economic slowdown managed to drag down activity in the january transfer window for the 2008-09 season . while english premier league clubs forked out 172 million euros for new players in the window , the top clubs from europe 's four other major leagues could n't match this amount between them . " european transfer markets as a whole have been extraordinarily quiet , and much of the activity in england has been in the form of loans and short-term contracts , " simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university , told reuters news agency . in italy , spending dropped by about 43 percent from the previous season to around 29 million euros .
german clubs meanwhile spent a little over 16 million euros for 42 player transfers . real madrid were the only primera liga club to buy big , spending around 43 million euros to sign klaas-jan huntelaar from ajax amsterdam and lassana diarra from portsmouth . dfm / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the grand coalition has had to make some compromises but it has shown itself to be capable of acting , " he said . in a separate interview , koehler added that he saw a growing gap between the public and the politicians meant to serve it . " a rift has grown between the politicians and citizens , " he said in the passauer neue presse on saturday .

" we wo n't notice anything this season , but if there is a global economic crisis then soccer wo n't escape unscathed , " he said .
" we will feel the effects and suffer a few cuts and bruises .
however , it wo n't be a major threat to the business model as it is too stable for that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss sepp blatter says soccer will eventually be affected by the crisis seifert 's words were an echo of those by world soccer chief sepp blatter , who spoke of a so-far unscathed world game at a press conference in manchester , england , on wednesday . " soccer is not too much touched by this economical tsunami , " he said .
" but you 've got to guard against the second wave . " bad news for some clubs however , there are some black clouds on the horizon .
while all 18 top bundesliga clubs registered a profit after tax in the 2006-07 business year , last year just 15 remained in the black .
in the second division the number dropped from 12 to nine . " the figures are n't as good as in 2006-07 , but are still very respectable , " said dfl finance officer christian mueller . transfer costs rose from 164.5 million euros to 192.3 million , while wages also increased by 40 percent from 530 million euros to 627 million . while the 40-percent figure is significant , it compares favorably to the english premier league and france 's top division where wages in the same period rose by 63 and 64 percent respectively . transfers hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaas-jan huntelaar , left , and arjen robben , right , are now team mates at real madrid despite the optimism in the dfl boardroom , the global economic slowdown managed to drag down activity in the january transfer window for the 2008-09 season . while english premier league clubs forked out 172 million euros for new players in the window , the top clubs from europe 's four other major leagues could n't match this amount between them . " european transfer markets as a whole have been extraordinarily quiet , and much of the activity in england has been in the form of loans and short-term contracts , " simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university , told reuters news agency . in italy , spending dropped by about 43 percent from the previous season to around 29 million euros .
german clubs meanwhile spent a little over 16 million euros for 42 player transfers . real madrid were the only primera liga club to buy big , spending around 43 million euros to sign klaas-jan huntelaar from ajax amsterdam and lassana diarra from portsmouth . dfm / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

authorities are still investigating the rampage that resulted in the death of 16 people , including the gunman . details about the life of the german teenager who shot dead 15 people including nine school pupils before killing himself continued to emerge saturday , march , 14 , three days after the shooting took place . investigators said tim k. , 17 , played " far cry 2 , " a first-person shooter video game in which players hunt arms traffickers in the jungle , the night before he went on a rampage at his former school in southwestern germany , the news magazine der spiegel reported on its web site saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teenage gunman killed 15 people before he died on wednesday , the teenager shot dead eight girls , one boy and three female teachers at the school , and killed three bystanders .
he died in a shootout with police around 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- from the school .
police say he shot himself . " to us , he was a calm young man , completely normal , " the gunman 's paternal grandmother told the mass-market bild newspaper on saturday .

" we wo n't notice anything this season , but if there is a global economic crisis then soccer wo n't escape unscathed , " he said .
" we will feel the effects and suffer a few cuts and bruises .
however , it wo n't be a major threat to the business model as it is too stable for that .

" but you 've got to guard against the second wave . " bad news for some clubs however , there are some black clouds on the horizon .
while all 18 top bundesliga clubs registered a profit after tax in the 2006-07 business year , last year just 15 remained in the black .
in the second division the number dropped from 12 to nine . " the figures are n't as good as in 2006-07 , but are still very respectable , " said dfl finance officer christian mueller . transfer costs rose from 164.5 million euros to 192.3 million , while wages also increased by 40 percent from 530 million euros to 627 million . while the 40-percent figure is significant , it compares favorably to the english premier league and france 's top division where wages in the same period rose by 63 and 64 percent respectively . transfers hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaas-jan huntelaar , left , and arjen robben , right , are now team mates at real madrid despite the optimism in the dfl boardroom , the global economic slowdown managed to drag down activity in the january transfer window for the 2008-09 season . while english premier league clubs forked out 172 million euros for new players in the window , the top clubs from europe 's four other major leagues could n't match this amount between them . " european transfer markets as a whole have been extraordinarily quiet , and much of the activity in england has been in the form of loans and short-term contracts , " simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university , told reuters news agency . in italy , spending dropped by about 43 percent from the previous season to around 29 million euros .
german clubs meanwhile spent a little over 16 million euros for 42 player transfers . real madrid were the only primera liga club to buy big , spending around 43 million euros to sign klaas-jan huntelaar from ajax amsterdam and lassana diarra from portsmouth . dfm / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will feel the effects and suffer a few cuts and bruises .
however , it wo n't be a major threat to the business model as it is too stable for that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss sepp blatter says soccer will eventually be affected by the crisis seifert 's words were an echo of those by world soccer chief sepp blatter , who spoke of a so-far unscathed world game at a press conference in manchester , england , on wednesday . " soccer is not too much touched by this economical tsunami , " he said .
" but you 've got to guard against the second wave . " bad news for some clubs however , there are some black clouds on the horizon .
while all 18 top bundesliga clubs registered a profit after tax in the 2006-07 business year , last year just 15 remained in the black .
in the second division the number dropped from 12 to nine . " the figures are n't as good as in 2006-07 , but are still very respectable , " said dfl finance officer christian mueller . transfer costs rose from 164.5 million euros to 192.3 million , while wages also increased by 40 percent from 530 million euros to 627 million . while the 40-percent figure is significant , it compares favorably to the english premier league and france 's top division where wages in the same period rose by 63 and 64 percent respectively . transfers hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaas-jan huntelaar , left , and arjen robben , right , are now team mates at real madrid despite the optimism in the dfl boardroom , the global economic slowdown managed to drag down activity in the january transfer window for the 2008-09 season . while english premier league clubs forked out 172 million euros for new players in the window , the top clubs from europe 's four other major leagues could n't match this amount between them . " european transfer markets as a whole have been extraordinarily quiet , and much of the activity in england has been in the form of loans and short-term contracts , " simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university , told reuters news agency . in italy , spending dropped by about 43 percent from the previous season to around 29 million euros .
german clubs meanwhile spent a little over 16 million euros for 42 player transfers . real madrid were the only primera liga club to buy big , spending around 43 million euros to sign klaas-jan huntelaar from ajax amsterdam and lassana diarra from portsmouth . dfm / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the second division the number dropped from 12 to nine . " the figures are n't as good as in 2006-07 , but are still very respectable , " said dfl finance officer christian mueller . transfer costs rose from 164.5 million euros to 192.3 million , while wages also increased by 40 percent from 530 million euros to 627 million . while the 40-percent figure is significant , it compares favorably to the english premier league and france 's top division where wages in the same period rose by 63 and 64 percent respectively . transfers hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaas-jan huntelaar , left , and arjen robben , right , are now team mates at real madrid despite the optimism in the dfl boardroom , the global economic slowdown managed to drag down activity in the january transfer window for the 2008-09 season . while english premier league clubs forked out 172 million euros for new players in the window , the top clubs from europe 's four other major leagues could n't match this amount between them . " european transfer markets as a whole have been extraordinarily quiet , and much of the activity in england has been in the form of loans and short-term contracts , " simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university , told reuters news agency . in italy , spending dropped by about 43 percent from the previous season to around 29 million euros .

" we wo n't notice anything this season , but if there is a global economic crisis then soccer wo n't escape unscathed , " he said .
" we will feel the effects and suffer a few cuts and bruises .
however , it wo n't be a major threat to the business model as it is too stable for that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss sepp blatter says soccer will eventually be affected by the crisis seifert 's words were an echo of those by world soccer chief sepp blatter , who spoke of a so-far unscathed world game at a press conference in manchester , england , on wednesday . " soccer is not too much touched by this economical tsunami , " he said .
" but you 've got to guard against the second wave . " bad news for some clubs however , there are some black clouds on the horizon .
while all 18 top bundesliga clubs registered a profit after tax in the 2006-07 business year , last year just 15 remained in the black .
in the second division the number dropped from 12 to nine . " the figures are n't as good as in 2006-07 , but are still very respectable , " said dfl finance officer christian mueller . transfer costs rose from 164.5 million euros to 192.3 million , while wages also increased by 40 percent from 530 million euros to 627 million . while the 40-percent figure is significant , it compares favorably to the english premier league and france 's top division where wages in the same period rose by 63 and 64 percent respectively . transfers hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaas-jan huntelaar , left , and arjen robben , right , are now team mates at real madrid despite the optimism in the dfl boardroom , the global economic slowdown managed to drag down activity in the january transfer window for the 2008-09 season . while english premier league clubs forked out 172 million euros for new players in the window , the top clubs from europe 's four other major leagues could n't match this amount between them . " european transfer markets as a whole have been extraordinarily quiet , and much of the activity in england has been in the form of loans and short-term contracts , " simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university , told reuters news agency . in italy , spending dropped by about 43 percent from the previous season to around 29 million euros .
german clubs meanwhile spent a little over 16 million euros for 42 player transfers . real madrid were the only primera liga club to buy big , spending around 43 million euros to sign klaas-jan huntelaar from ajax amsterdam and lassana diarra from portsmouth . dfm / sms / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm very positive , i 'm very optimistic that we will be able to come to an agreement together with the united states , with emerging economies such as china and india , " she said saturday , march 14 .
" we have to come up with substantive results . " merkel added that the summit would " be a positive signal to the world that we want to promote growth . " brown also voiced confidence , saying the london summit would seek to agree on reshaping the international regulatory system .
" you 'll see massive change in the supervisory system , " he said . " it 's going to include tax and regulatory havens where it did n't before , " he said .
" we must act to reshape the regulatory system for the new times .
regulation in one country must cooperate more closely with regulation in another country . finance minister to pave the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance ministers are trying to set the groundwork for a deal their bosses can agree to the announcements came even as finance ministers from g20 nations engaged in separate talks to set the foundations for the heads of state meeting in april . splits seemed to have emerged in the g20 with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis . contrary to a the us position of spending more on stimulus packages to revive the economy , a german-french proposal focuses on international regulation to prevent future problems . ahead of the talks , alistair darling , britain 's finance minister and host of the ministers ' meeting , said he was " quite sure " progress would be made . " we are committed to deliver the scale of sustained effort necessary to restore growth , " said a g20 statement issued after talks between finance ministers and central bankers . extra imf funding expected finance ministers , however , seemed to have papered over differences between the american and european positions and instead focused on extra funding for the international monetary fund and other international agencies that loan money to struggling countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf is hoping to have its funding doubled " we need a commitment from countries that they will do whatever is necessary and as for long as necessary to support their economies , " darling said .
" we really must take action to stop damage being done to the emerging economies , who are seeing money coming out of their systems . " the united states has suggested that the imf 's lending capacity be tripled to $ 750 billion dollars , but european g20 leaders have come out in favor of doubling the bank 's resources for $ 500 billion .
the asian development bank is also hoping for more money . " the g20 is ready to significantly increase imf resources , " a european source told reporters , speaking on condition of anonymity , adding that no announcement on the size of the increase would be made saturday . world bank chief robert zoellick , who was also present at the finance ministers ' meeting , said additional spending would only provide a short-lived " sugar high " if governments failed to rid banks of toxic assets that continue to undermine confidence , trust and the desire to lend or invest . the g20 accounts for over 80 percent of the world 's output , which is expected to shrink this year and by more than any year since the 1930s . sms / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm very positive , i 'm very optimistic that we will be able to come to an agreement together with the united states , with emerging economies such as china and india , " she said saturday , march 14 .
" we have to come up with substantive results . " merkel added that the summit would " be a positive signal to the world that we want to promote growth . " brown also voiced confidence , saying the london summit would seek to agree on reshaping the international regulatory system .
" you 'll see massive change in the supervisory system , " he said . " it 's going to include tax and regulatory havens where it did n't before , " he said .
" we must act to reshape the regulatory system for the new times .
regulation in one country must cooperate more closely with regulation in another country . finance minister to pave the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance ministers are trying to set the groundwork for a deal their bosses can agree to the announcements came even as finance ministers from g20 nations engaged in separate talks to set the foundations for the heads of state meeting in april . splits seemed to have emerged in the g20 with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis . contrary to a the us position of spending more on stimulus packages to revive the economy , a german-french proposal focuses on international regulation to prevent future problems . ahead of the talks , alistair darling , britain 's finance minister and host of the ministers ' meeting , said he was " quite sure " progress would be made . " we are committed to deliver the scale of sustained effort necessary to restore growth , " said a g20 statement issued after talks between finance ministers and central bankers . extra imf funding expected finance ministers , however , seemed to have papered over differences between the american and european positions and instead focused on extra funding for the international monetary fund and other international agencies that loan money to struggling countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf is hoping to have its funding doubled " we need a commitment from countries that they will do whatever is necessary and as for long as necessary to support their economies , " darling said .
" we really must take action to stop damage being done to the emerging economies , who are seeing money coming out of their systems . " the united states has suggested that the imf 's lending capacity be tripled to $ 750 billion dollars , but european g20 leaders have come out in favor of doubling the bank 's resources for $ 500 billion .
the asian development bank is also hoping for more money . " the g20 is ready to significantly increase imf resources , " a european source told reporters , speaking on condition of anonymity , adding that no announcement on the size of the increase would be made saturday . world bank chief robert zoellick , who was also present at the finance ministers ' meeting , said additional spending would only provide a short-lived " sugar high " if governments failed to rid banks of toxic assets that continue to undermine confidence , trust and the desire to lend or invest . the g20 accounts for over 80 percent of the world 's output , which is expected to shrink this year and by more than any year since the 1930s . sms / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there , they will attempt to find common ground on the best ways to deal with the global financial crisis ahead of a g20 summit scheduled for april 2 .
g20 countries together represent more than 80 percent of the global economy . zoellick , a former top us state department official , warned that 2009 " is shaping up to be a very dangerous year " and called for wealthy g20 countries to take immediate action . europe downplays divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert zoellick said poor countries ca n't be ignored with talks of a trans-atlantic rift growing over the week , europe 's finance ministers insisted that there was a lot of common ground .
the united states has been calling for additional spending measures ; something which many european countries have said is not the right focus .
countries such as germany and france have insisted that regulations on banks be tightened . " i do n't actually think that the divisions between the european countries and the us are anything like what has been described over the last few days , " the meeting 's host , british finance minister alistair darling , told bbc radio on friday . " i think on both sides of the atlantic - and also , for that matter , in other parts of the world - there is a commitment to ensure that we support people , support businesses and our economies , " he added . th / sms / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no leave of absence for the responsibility of governing , " he told the daily ruhr nachrichten on saturday , march 14 .
" as long as the coalition is presiding , it has to go respectably about its work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler 's duties are largely symbolic , but he has engaged the government at times pointing to the current global economic crisis , koehler said the people of germany had a right to demand their leaders work in the best interest of the country - not the political parties of which they are members . the president also said opposition parties should present their alternatives to the government 's plans rather than denouncing them out of hand . though none of the parties in the ruling coalition is thrilled with the partners it 's had to work with since the last election in 2005 , koehler said the government has not fallen into disarray . " the grand coalition has had to make some compromises but it has shown itself to be capable of acting , " he said . in a separate interview , koehler added that he saw a growing gap between the public and the politicians meant to serve it . " a rift has grown between the politicians and citizens , " he said in the passauer neue presse on saturday .

" i 'm very positive , i 'm very optimistic that we will be able to come to an agreement together with the united states , with emerging economies such as china and india , " she said saturday , march 14 .
" we have to come up with substantive results . " merkel added that the summit would " be a positive signal to the world that we want to promote growth . " brown also voiced confidence , saying the london summit would seek to agree on reshaping the international regulatory system .
" you 'll see massive change in the supervisory system , " he said . " it 's going to include tax and regulatory havens where it did n't before , " he said .
" we must act to reshape the regulatory system for the new times .
regulation in one country must cooperate more closely with regulation in another country . finance minister to pave the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance ministers are trying to set the groundwork for a deal their bosses can agree to the announcements came even as finance ministers from g20 nations engaged in separate talks to set the foundations for the heads of state meeting in april . splits seemed to have emerged in the g20 with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis . contrary to a the us position of spending more on stimulus packages to revive the economy , a german-french proposal focuses on international regulation to prevent future problems . ahead of the talks , alistair darling , britain 's finance minister and host of the ministers ' meeting , said he was " quite sure " progress would be made . " we are committed to deliver the scale of sustained effort necessary to restore growth , " said a g20 statement issued after talks between finance ministers and central bankers . extra imf funding expected finance ministers , however , seemed to have papered over differences between the american and european positions and instead focused on extra funding for the international monetary fund and other international agencies that loan money to struggling countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf is hoping to have its funding doubled " we need a commitment from countries that they will do whatever is necessary and as for long as necessary to support their economies , " darling said .
" we really must take action to stop damage being done to the emerging economies , who are seeing money coming out of their systems . " the united states has suggested that the imf 's lending capacity be tripled to $ 750 billion dollars , but european g20 leaders have come out in favor of doubling the bank 's resources for $ 500 billion .
the asian development bank is also hoping for more money . " the g20 is ready to significantly increase imf resources , " a european source told reporters , speaking on condition of anonymity , adding that no announcement on the size of the increase would be made saturday . world bank chief robert zoellick , who was also present at the finance ministers ' meeting , said additional spending would only provide a short-lived " sugar high " if governments failed to rid banks of toxic assets that continue to undermine confidence , trust and the desire to lend or invest . the g20 accounts for over 80 percent of the world 's output , which is expected to shrink this year and by more than any year since the 1930s . sms / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
