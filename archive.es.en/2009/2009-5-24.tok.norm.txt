stuttgart ended up in third with 64 points , but can still qualify for the champions league .
wolfsburg went up 3-0 after just 26 minutes of play with goals from zvjezdan misimovic , grafite and an own goal by werder 's sebastian proedl .
bremen pulled one back through diego before wolfsburg 's striker duo grafite and edin dzeko sealed the title with two second half goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite , left , scored two goals against bremen " it 's completely mad to have won the championship , " said dzeko .
" it 's a great feeling - we are going to do a lot of celebrating tonight . "
wolfsburg coach , felix magath , who was fired by munich only two years ago , led the team to its maiden title .
magath however wo n't be around to coach wolfsburg for the champions league - he 's decided to move to schalke next season .
" i knew that we were good enough , " said magath .
" we put in some good performances all season and we deserved to be champions .
of course , it will be hard to leave now . "
it has been an astonishing turn around for wolfsburg , which almost faced relegation last year .
few would have expected their side to have a chance at the trophy , the team was clearly an outsider at the start of the season .
saturday 's win over bremen wrapped up one of the biggest sensations the bundesliga has ever seen - and the credits for the success go to the coach , says soccer analyst paul chapman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach felix magath was the mastermind behind wolfsburg 's success " some people say magath took a middle of the road team , but he did n't .
he took a really bad and struggling team that had finished close to relegation for two seasons running . "
" magath started with nothing and he brought in lots of new players , a lot of young exciting talent .
wolfsburg has played wonderful attacking football this season .
they absolutely deserve to be champions . "
the uefa qualifiers in the bundesliga for next season are hertha bsc berlin and the hamburger sv , which finished 4th and 5th respectively .
at the bottom end of the german league standings , arminia bielefeld finished last , followed by karlsruhe sc , with both now relegated to the second division .
karlsruhe , at least , went out in style thrashing a hapless hertha bsc berlin 4-0 in its final first division game .
despite beating leverkusen 3-0 , energie cottbus , which ended the season in 16th place as the third worst team , faces a relegation round against either mainz or nuremberg of the second division , to decide who gets the last remaining spot in next season 's bundesliga. gb / dpa / sid / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european foreign ministers will be putting pressure on burma at an asia-europe meeting next week to end the trial of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . the global financial crisis will be at the top of the agenda of the asia-europe foreign ministers ' -lrb- asem -rrb- meeting in hanoi on monday and tuesday , but the human rights situation in burma is still likely to steal the headlines .
the european union is mulling over tougher sanctions against the burmese military junta because of suu kyi 's trial , which started on monday , may 18 .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
british foreign secretary david miliband called the proceedings against suu kyi a " show trial . "
" we need to make sure that the burmese regime understands fully the risks that it 's taking , " he said .
sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said the issue would be discussed at the asem conference in hanoi .
burma is expected to attend the meeting .
what will the neighbors say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi was put on trial after a us man swam across a lake to visit her in her home eu ministers said it was the duty of burma 's neighbors to put political pressure on the regime .
the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , which includes burma , has described the suu kyi trial as threatening the regime 's " honor and credibility " and repeated calls for her release .
asean , however , has a policy of non-interference and is unlikely to back its words with actions .
according to china , burma should be left alone to handle its internal affairs . if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
suu kyi has been detained for more than 13 of the past 19 years , most of them at her home in rangoon. ch / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among the contenders is france 's " un prophete " -lrb- a prophet -rrb- by director jacques audierd , a well-liked and gripping prison drama , and " fish tank " by britain 's andrea arnold , the story an unhappy teenager .
new zealand-born jane campion , who won the festival 's highest honor 16 years ago for " the piano " , is hoping to do so again with her film " bright star " .
the biopic recounts the love story of romantic poet john keats and his neighbor fanny brawne .
german stories and stars at cannes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the white ribbon " depicts a germany from almost 100 years ago a film by austrian director michael haneke has also gotten some attention .
" das weisse band " -lrb- the white ribbon -rrb- is set in rural germany in the years before world war i and depicts a series of incidents that point to the rise of european fascism .
quentin tarantino 's much-hyped " inglourious basterds " and its hollywood star brad pitt have received mixed reviews , with some saying the film 's german and austrian actors have stolen the show from pitt .
in the film a group of jewish american wwii soldiers in occupied france seek revenge against the nazis . the violent flick uses english , french and german and was filmed in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 24.05.2009 germany looks ahead to september 's election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the presidential vote a signal for september 's general election ?
with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .
" it will be very close this fall , " predicts juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the general election. gb / dw / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we now have three offers to take over opel , " guttenberg told the newspaper bild am sontag on sunday , may 23 .
" that does not mean that one of them will automatically and urgently take effect . "
" firstly , we need a high degree of certainty that the considerable sum of taxpayers ' money we will have to put up is not lost .
none of the three plans sufficiently meets these requirements at present , " the minister said .
guttenberg said germany 's preference would be made known next week , but did not rule out opel going into bankruptcy if the final bids failed to meet berlin 's requirements .
" if the shortcomings are not lifted , then controlled insolvency would clearly be a better solution , " he said .
" it , too , could open possibilities for opel 's future . "
three bidders in the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg sees shortcomings in all the submitted bids canadian-austrian car parts and assembly group magna , fiat of italy and the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
china 's beijing automotive industry holding co .
-lrb- baic -rrb- has also expressed interest in securing a stake , but has not formally made an offer .
magna , which has pledged to keep all opel plants in germany open but slash 10 percent of the 25,000 workforce , has emerged as the front-runner to take over the carmaker .
but leaders of the four german states where opel has factories were divided on the offer .
the governor of the german rhineland-palatinate state , kurt beck , said that the negotiations would continue with all of the bidders , but that the " main focus " would stay on magna .
north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers , however , rejected the plan as " unacceptable " and " unfair " because of the 2,200 jobs that would be at risk in his home state .
according to press reports , magna was expected to ask the german government for five billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in guarantees , while fiat was reported to be requesting seven billion euros .
german officials declined to comment these figures .
job cuts a must fiat chairman sergio marchionne told bild am sonntag that a maximum of 2,000 jobs would be lost in germany under a revised bid submitted by the italian carmaker .
canada-based magna , which has extensive operations in austria , filed its proposal in conjunction with russia automotive group gaz and russia 's sberbank .
the final decision on the future of gm 's european operation will be reached by gm and the us government , but germany has a stake in the decision as any outcome is likely to rely on german state guarantees .
meanwhile , gm must present the us government with a viable strategy for survival by may 29 or risk possible bankruptcy. hf / dpa / afp / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european foreign ministers will be putting pressure on burma at an asia-europe meeting next week to end the trial of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . the global financial crisis will be at the top of the agenda of the asia-europe foreign ministers ' -lrb- asem -rrb- meeting in hanoi on monday and tuesday , but the human rights situation in burma is still likely to steal the headlines .
the european union is mulling over tougher sanctions against the burmese military junta because of suu kyi 's trial , which started on monday , may 18 .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
british foreign secretary david miliband called the proceedings against suu kyi a " show trial . "
" we need to make sure that the burmese regime understands fully the risks that it 's taking , " he said .
sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said the issue would be discussed at the asem conference in hanoi .
burma is expected to attend the meeting .

the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , which includes burma , has described the suu kyi trial as threatening the regime 's " honor and credibility " and repeated calls for her release .
asean , however , has a policy of non-interference and is unlikely to back its words with actions .
according to china , burma should be left alone to handle its internal affairs . if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .

with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .
" it will be very close this fall , " predicts juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the general election. gb / dw / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european foreign ministers will be putting pressure on burma at an asia-europe meeting next week to end the trial of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . the global financial crisis will be at the top of the agenda of the asia-europe foreign ministers ' -lrb- asem -rrb- meeting in hanoi on monday and tuesday , but the human rights situation in burma is still likely to steal the headlines .
the european union is mulling over tougher sanctions against the burmese military junta because of suu kyi 's trial , which started on monday , may 18 .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
british foreign secretary david miliband called the proceedings against suu kyi a " show trial . "
" we need to make sure that the burmese regime understands fully the risks that it 's taking , " he said .
sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said the issue would be discussed at the asem conference in hanoi .
burma is expected to attend the meeting .
what will the neighbors say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi was put on trial after a us man swam across a lake to visit her in her home eu ministers said it was the duty of burma 's neighbors to put political pressure on the regime .
the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , which includes burma , has described the suu kyi trial as threatening the regime 's " honor and credibility " and repeated calls for her release .
asean , however , has a policy of non-interference and is unlikely to back its words with actions .
according to china , burma should be left alone to handle its internal affairs . if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
suu kyi has been detained for more than 13 of the past 19 years , most of them at her home in rangoon. ch / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .
" it will be very close this fall , " predicts juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the general election. gb / dw / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .

stuttgart ended up in third with 64 points , but can still qualify for the champions league .
wolfsburg went up 3-0 after just 26 minutes of play with goals from zvjezdan misimovic , grafite and an own goal by werder 's sebastian proedl .
bremen pulled one back through diego before wolfsburg 's striker duo grafite and edin dzeko sealed the title with two second half goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite , left , scored two goals against bremen " it 's completely mad to have won the championship , " said dzeko .
" it 's a great feeling - we are going to do a lot of celebrating tonight . "
wolfsburg coach , felix magath , who was fired by munich only two years ago , led the team to its maiden title .
magath however wo n't be around to coach wolfsburg for the champions league - he 's decided to move to schalke next season .
" i knew that we were good enough , " said magath .
" we put in some good performances all season and we deserved to be champions .
of course , it will be hard to leave now . "
it has been an astonishing turn around for wolfsburg , which almost faced relegation last year .
few would have expected their side to have a chance at the trophy , the team was clearly an outsider at the start of the season .
saturday 's win over bremen wrapped up one of the biggest sensations the bundesliga has ever seen - and the credits for the success go to the coach , says soccer analyst paul chapman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach felix magath was the mastermind behind wolfsburg 's success " some people say magath took a middle of the road team , but he did n't .
he took a really bad and struggling team that had finished close to relegation for two seasons running . "
" magath started with nothing and he brought in lots of new players , a lot of young exciting talent .
wolfsburg has played wonderful attacking football this season .
they absolutely deserve to be champions . "
the uefa qualifiers in the bundesliga for next season are hertha bsc berlin and the hamburger sv , which finished 4th and 5th respectively .
at the bottom end of the german league standings , arminia bielefeld finished last , followed by karlsruhe sc , with both now relegated to the second division .
karlsruhe , at least , went out in style thrashing a hapless hertha bsc berlin 4-0 in its final first division game .
despite beating leverkusen 3-0 , energie cottbus , which ended the season in 16th place as the third worst team , faces a relegation round against either mainz or nuremberg of the second division , to decide who gets the last remaining spot in next season 's bundesliga. gb / dpa / sid / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .
" it will be very close this fall , " predicts juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the general election. gb / dw / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .
" it will be very close this fall , " predicts juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the general election. gb / dw / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we now have three offers to take over opel , " guttenberg told the newspaper bild am sontag on sunday , may 23 .
" that does not mean that one of them will automatically and urgently take effect . "
" firstly , we need a high degree of certainty that the considerable sum of taxpayers ' money we will have to put up is not lost .
none of the three plans sufficiently meets these requirements at present , " the minister said .
guttenberg said germany 's preference would be made known next week , but did not rule out opel going into bankruptcy if the final bids failed to meet berlin 's requirements .
" if the shortcomings are not lifted , then controlled insolvency would clearly be a better solution , " he said .
" it , too , could open possibilities for opel 's future . "
three bidders in the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg sees shortcomings in all the submitted bids canadian-austrian car parts and assembly group magna , fiat of italy and the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
china 's beijing automotive industry holding co .
-lrb- baic -rrb- has also expressed interest in securing a stake , but has not formally made an offer .
magna , which has pledged to keep all opel plants in germany open but slash 10 percent of the 25,000 workforce , has emerged as the front-runner to take over the carmaker .
but leaders of the four german states where opel has factories were divided on the offer .
the governor of the german rhineland-palatinate state , kurt beck , said that the negotiations would continue with all of the bidders , but that the " main focus " would stay on magna .
north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers , however , rejected the plan as " unacceptable " and " unfair " because of the 2,200 jobs that would be at risk in his home state .
according to press reports , magna was expected to ask the german government for five billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in guarantees , while fiat was reported to be requesting seven billion euros .
german officials declined to comment these figures .
job cuts a must fiat chairman sergio marchionne told bild am sonntag that a maximum of 2,000 jobs would be lost in germany under a revised bid submitted by the italian carmaker .
canada-based magna , which has extensive operations in austria , filed its proposal in conjunction with russia automotive group gaz and russia 's sberbank .
the final decision on the future of gm 's european operation will be reached by gm and the us government , but germany has a stake in the decision as any outcome is likely to rely on german state guarantees .
meanwhile , gm must present the us government with a viable strategy for survival by may 29 or risk possible bankruptcy. hf / dpa / afp / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among the contenders is france 's " un prophete " -lrb- a prophet -rrb- by director jacques audierd , a well-liked and gripping prison drama , and " fish tank " by britain 's andrea arnold , the story an unhappy teenager .
new zealand-born jane campion , who won the festival 's highest honor 16 years ago for " the piano " , is hoping to do so again with her film " bright star " .
the biopic recounts the love story of romantic poet john keats and his neighbor fanny brawne .
german stories and stars at cannes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the white ribbon " depicts a germany from almost 100 years ago a film by austrian director michael haneke has also gotten some attention .

quentin tarantino 's much-hyped " inglourious basterds " and its hollywood star brad pitt have received mixed reviews , with some saying the film 's german and austrian actors have stolen the show from pitt .
in the film a group of jewish american wwii soldiers in occupied france seek revenge against the nazis . the violent flick uses english , french and german and was filmed in germany .
til schweiger and daniel bruehl , who have both seen some success in hollywood , were among 45 german actors with roles in the film .
effect of the economy visible at festival cannes is typically known for its glitz and glamour as international movie stars and directors descend upon the luxurious french riviera city , but while brad pitt and his partner angelina jolie did grace the red carpet with their presence , there was decidedly less late-night revelry and the overall mood was a bit toned down .
both because of the films chosen and penny-pinching studios , there were simply less big name stars. hf / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stuttgart ended up in third with 64 points , but can still qualify for the champions league .
wolfsburg went up 3-0 after just 26 minutes of play with goals from zvjezdan misimovic , grafite and an own goal by werder 's sebastian proedl .
bremen pulled one back through diego before wolfsburg 's striker duo grafite and edin dzeko sealed the title with two second half goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite , left , scored two goals against bremen " it 's completely mad to have won the championship , " said dzeko .
" it 's a great feeling - we are going to do a lot of celebrating tonight . "
wolfsburg coach , felix magath , who was fired by munich only two years ago , led the team to its maiden title .
magath however wo n't be around to coach wolfsburg for the champions league - he 's decided to move to schalke next season .
" i knew that we were good enough , " said magath .
" we put in some good performances all season and we deserved to be champions .
of course , it will be hard to leave now . "
it has been an astonishing turn around for wolfsburg , which almost faced relegation last year .
few would have expected their side to have a chance at the trophy , the team was clearly an outsider at the start of the season .
saturday 's win over bremen wrapped up one of the biggest sensations the bundesliga has ever seen - and the credits for the success go to the coach , says soccer analyst paul chapman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach felix magath was the mastermind behind wolfsburg 's success " some people say magath took a middle of the road team , but he did n't .
he took a really bad and struggling team that had finished close to relegation for two seasons running . "
" magath started with nothing and he brought in lots of new players , a lot of young exciting talent .
wolfsburg has played wonderful attacking football this season .
they absolutely deserve to be champions . "
the uefa qualifiers in the bundesliga for next season are hertha bsc berlin and the hamburger sv , which finished 4th and 5th respectively .
at the bottom end of the german league standings , arminia bielefeld finished last , followed by karlsruhe sc , with both now relegated to the second division .
karlsruhe , at least , went out in style thrashing a hapless hertha bsc berlin 4-0 in its final first division game .
despite beating leverkusen 3-0 , energie cottbus , which ended the season in 16th place as the third worst team , faces a relegation round against either mainz or nuremberg of the second division , to decide who gets the last remaining spot in next season 's bundesliga. gb / dpa / sid / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stuttgart ended up in third with 64 points , but can still qualify for the champions league .
wolfsburg went up 3-0 after just 26 minutes of play with goals from zvjezdan misimovic , grafite and an own goal by werder 's sebastian proedl .
bremen pulled one back through diego before wolfsburg 's striker duo grafite and edin dzeko sealed the title with two second half goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite , left , scored two goals against bremen " it 's completely mad to have won the championship , " said dzeko .
" it 's a great feeling - we are going to do a lot of celebrating tonight . "
wolfsburg coach , felix magath , who was fired by munich only two years ago , led the team to its maiden title .
magath however wo n't be around to coach wolfsburg for the champions league - he 's decided to move to schalke next season .
" i knew that we were good enough , " said magath .
" we put in some good performances all season and we deserved to be champions .
of course , it will be hard to leave now . "
it has been an astonishing turn around for wolfsburg , which almost faced relegation last year .
few would have expected their side to have a chance at the trophy , the team was clearly an outsider at the start of the season .
saturday 's win over bremen wrapped up one of the biggest sensations the bundesliga has ever seen - and the credits for the success go to the coach , says soccer analyst paul chapman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach felix magath was the mastermind behind wolfsburg 's success " some people say magath took a middle of the road team , but he did n't .
he took a really bad and struggling team that had finished close to relegation for two seasons running . "
" magath started with nothing and he brought in lots of new players , a lot of young exciting talent .
wolfsburg has played wonderful attacking football this season .
they absolutely deserve to be champions . "
the uefa qualifiers in the bundesliga for next season are hertha bsc berlin and the hamburger sv , which finished 4th and 5th respectively .
at the bottom end of the german league standings , arminia bielefeld finished last , followed by karlsruhe sc , with both now relegated to the second division .
karlsruhe , at least , went out in style thrashing a hapless hertha bsc berlin 4-0 in its final first division game .
despite beating leverkusen 3-0 , energie cottbus , which ended the season in 16th place as the third worst team , faces a relegation round against either mainz or nuremberg of the second division , to decide who gets the last remaining spot in next season 's bundesliga. gb / dpa / sid / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european foreign ministers will be putting pressure on burma at an asia-europe meeting next week to end the trial of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . the global financial crisis will be at the top of the agenda of the asia-europe foreign ministers ' -lrb- asem -rrb- meeting in hanoi on monday and tuesday , but the human rights situation in burma is still likely to steal the headlines .
the european union is mulling over tougher sanctions against the burmese military junta because of suu kyi 's trial , which started on monday , may 18 .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
british foreign secretary david miliband called the proceedings against suu kyi a " show trial . "
" we need to make sure that the burmese regime understands fully the risks that it 's taking , " he said .
sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said the issue would be discussed at the asem conference in hanoi .
burma is expected to attend the meeting .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi was put on trial after a us man swam across a lake to visit her in her home eu ministers said it was the duty of burma 's neighbors to put political pressure on the regime .
the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , which includes burma , has described the suu kyi trial as threatening the regime 's " honor and credibility " and repeated calls for her release .
asean , however , has a policy of non-interference and is unlikely to back its words with actions .
according to china , burma should be left alone to handle its internal affairs . if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 24.05.2009 germany looks ahead to september 's election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the presidential vote a signal for september 's general election ?
with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .
" it will be very close this fall , " predicts juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the general election. gb / dw / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stuttgart ended up in third with 64 points , but can still qualify for the champions league .
wolfsburg went up 3-0 after just 26 minutes of play with goals from zvjezdan misimovic , grafite and an own goal by werder 's sebastian proedl .
bremen pulled one back through diego before wolfsburg 's striker duo grafite and edin dzeko sealed the title with two second half goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite , left , scored two goals against bremen " it 's completely mad to have won the championship , " said dzeko .
" it 's a great feeling - we are going to do a lot of celebrating tonight . "
wolfsburg coach , felix magath , who was fired by munich only two years ago , led the team to its maiden title .
magath however wo n't be around to coach wolfsburg for the champions league - he 's decided to move to schalke next season .
" i knew that we were good enough , " said magath .
" we put in some good performances all season and we deserved to be champions .
of course , it will be hard to leave now . "
it has been an astonishing turn around for wolfsburg , which almost faced relegation last year .
few would have expected their side to have a chance at the trophy , the team was clearly an outsider at the start of the season .
saturday 's win over bremen wrapped up one of the biggest sensations the bundesliga has ever seen - and the credits for the success go to the coach , says soccer analyst paul chapman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach felix magath was the mastermind behind wolfsburg 's success " some people say magath took a middle of the road team , but he did n't .
he took a really bad and struggling team that had finished close to relegation for two seasons running . "
" magath started with nothing and he brought in lots of new players , a lot of young exciting talent .
wolfsburg has played wonderful attacking football this season .
they absolutely deserve to be champions . "
the uefa qualifiers in the bundesliga for next season are hertha bsc berlin and the hamburger sv , which finished 4th and 5th respectively .
at the bottom end of the german league standings , arminia bielefeld finished last , followed by karlsruhe sc , with both now relegated to the second division .
karlsruhe , at least , went out in style thrashing a hapless hertha bsc berlin 4-0 in its final first division game .
despite beating leverkusen 3-0 , energie cottbus , which ended the season in 16th place as the third worst team , faces a relegation round against either mainz or nuremberg of the second division , to decide who gets the last remaining spot in next season 's bundesliga. gb / dpa / sid / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 24.05.2009 germany looks ahead to september 's election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the presidential vote a signal for september 's general election ?
with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .
" it will be very close this fall , " predicts juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the general election. gb / dw / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .
" it will be very close this fall , " predicts juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the general election. gb / dw / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stuttgart ended up in third with 64 points , but can still qualify for the champions league .
wolfsburg went up 3-0 after just 26 minutes of play with goals from zvjezdan misimovic , grafite and an own goal by werder 's sebastian proedl .
bremen pulled one back through diego before wolfsburg 's striker duo grafite and edin dzeko sealed the title with two second half goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite , left , scored two goals against bremen " it 's completely mad to have won the championship , " said dzeko .
" it 's a great feeling - we are going to do a lot of celebrating tonight . "
wolfsburg coach , felix magath , who was fired by munich only two years ago , led the team to its maiden title .
magath however wo n't be around to coach wolfsburg for the champions league - he 's decided to move to schalke next season .
" i knew that we were good enough , " said magath .
" we put in some good performances all season and we deserved to be champions .
of course , it will be hard to leave now . "

" we now have three offers to take over opel , " guttenberg told the newspaper bild am sontag on sunday , may 23 .
" that does not mean that one of them will automatically and urgently take effect . "
" firstly , we need a high degree of certainty that the considerable sum of taxpayers ' money we will have to put up is not lost .
none of the three plans sufficiently meets these requirements at present , " the minister said .
guttenberg said germany 's preference would be made known next week , but did not rule out opel going into bankruptcy if the final bids failed to meet berlin 's requirements .
" if the shortcomings are not lifted , then controlled insolvency would clearly be a better solution , " he said .
" it , too , could open possibilities for opel 's future . "
three bidders in the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg sees shortcomings in all the submitted bids canadian-austrian car parts and assembly group magna , fiat of italy and the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
china 's beijing automotive industry holding co .
-lrb- baic -rrb- has also expressed interest in securing a stake , but has not formally made an offer .
magna , which has pledged to keep all opel plants in germany open but slash 10 percent of the 25,000 workforce , has emerged as the front-runner to take over the carmaker .
but leaders of the four german states where opel has factories were divided on the offer .
the governor of the german rhineland-palatinate state , kurt beck , said that the negotiations would continue with all of the bidders , but that the " main focus " would stay on magna .
north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers , however , rejected the plan as " unacceptable " and " unfair " because of the 2,200 jobs that would be at risk in his home state .
according to press reports , magna was expected to ask the german government for five billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in guarantees , while fiat was reported to be requesting seven billion euros .
german officials declined to comment these figures .
job cuts a must fiat chairman sergio marchionne told bild am sonntag that a maximum of 2,000 jobs would be lost in germany under a revised bid submitted by the italian carmaker .
canada-based magna , which has extensive operations in austria , filed its proposal in conjunction with russia automotive group gaz and russia 's sberbank .
the final decision on the future of gm 's european operation will be reached by gm and the us government , but germany has a stake in the decision as any outcome is likely to rely on german state guarantees .
meanwhile , gm must present the us government with a viable strategy for survival by may 29 or risk possible bankruptcy. hf / dpa / afp / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stuttgart ended up in third with 64 points , but can still qualify for the champions league .
wolfsburg went up 3-0 after just 26 minutes of play with goals from zvjezdan misimovic , grafite and an own goal by werder 's sebastian proedl .
bremen pulled one back through diego before wolfsburg 's striker duo grafite and edin dzeko sealed the title with two second half goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite , left , scored two goals against bremen " it 's completely mad to have won the championship , " said dzeko .
" it 's a great feeling - we are going to do a lot of celebrating tonight . "
wolfsburg coach , felix magath , who was fired by munich only two years ago , led the team to its maiden title .
magath however wo n't be around to coach wolfsburg for the champions league - he 's decided to move to schalke next season .
" i knew that we were good enough , " said magath .
" we put in some good performances all season and we deserved to be champions .
of course , it will be hard to leave now . "
it has been an astonishing turn around for wolfsburg , which almost faced relegation last year .
few would have expected their side to have a chance at the trophy , the team was clearly an outsider at the start of the season .
saturday 's win over bremen wrapped up one of the biggest sensations the bundesliga has ever seen - and the credits for the success go to the coach , says soccer analyst paul chapman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach felix magath was the mastermind behind wolfsburg 's success " some people say magath took a middle of the road team , but he did n't .
he took a really bad and struggling team that had finished close to relegation for two seasons running . "
" magath started with nothing and he brought in lots of new players , a lot of young exciting talent .
wolfsburg has played wonderful attacking football this season .
they absolutely deserve to be champions . "
the uefa qualifiers in the bundesliga for next season are hertha bsc berlin and the hamburger sv , which finished 4th and 5th respectively .
at the bottom end of the german league standings , arminia bielefeld finished last , followed by karlsruhe sc , with both now relegated to the second division .
karlsruhe , at least , went out in style thrashing a hapless hertha bsc berlin 4-0 in its final first division game .
despite beating leverkusen 3-0 , energie cottbus , which ended the season in 16th place as the third worst team , faces a relegation round against either mainz or nuremberg of the second division , to decide who gets the last remaining spot in next season 's bundesliga. gb / dpa / sid / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among the contenders is france 's " un prophete " -lrb- a prophet -rrb- by director jacques audierd , a well-liked and gripping prison drama , and " fish tank " by britain 's andrea arnold , the story an unhappy teenager .
new zealand-born jane campion , who won the festival 's highest honor 16 years ago for " the piano " , is hoping to do so again with her film " bright star " .
the biopic recounts the love story of romantic poet john keats and his neighbor fanny brawne .
german stories and stars at cannes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the white ribbon " depicts a germany from almost 100 years ago a film by austrian director michael haneke has also gotten some attention .
" das weisse band " -lrb- the white ribbon -rrb- is set in rural germany in the years before world war i and depicts a series of incidents that point to the rise of european fascism .
quentin tarantino 's much-hyped " inglourious basterds " and its hollywood star brad pitt have received mixed reviews , with some saying the film 's german and austrian actors have stolen the show from pitt .
in the film a group of jewish american wwii soldiers in occupied france seek revenge against the nazis . the violent flick uses english , french and german and was filmed in germany .
til schweiger and daniel bruehl , who have both seen some success in hollywood , were among 45 german actors with roles in the film .
effect of the economy visible at festival cannes is typically known for its glitz and glamour as international movie stars and directors descend upon the luxurious french riviera city , but while brad pitt and his partner angelina jolie did grace the red carpet with their presence , there was decidedly less late-night revelry and the overall mood was a bit toned down .
both because of the films chosen and penny-pinching studios , there were simply less big name stars. hf / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .
" it will be very close this fall , " predicts juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the general election. gb / dw / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .
" it will be very close this fall , " predicts juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the general election. gb / dw / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news that the perpetrator of a 1967 shooting was a spy for east germany 's stasi secret police has sent shockwaves through germany , shedding new light on the country 's postwar history , amid calls for a fresh inquiry . former german interior minister , otto schily , and dirk niebel , general-secretary of germany 's liberal free democrats , have called for a new investigation into the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting in 1967 of student activist benno ohnesorg .
schily , who , before becoming a social democrat and interior minister , was a green party activist and defense lawyer for leftist german terrorists , said the new stasi revelations meant the case had to be " politically and juristically re-evaluated . "
" the files require a very precise re-examination , " he said .
niebel of the fdp urged all parties in parliament " without delay to make way for a no-holds-barred inquiry into stasi involvement in the old west germany . "
berlin 's former spd mayor , klaus schuetz , said the pension claims of the policeman , who shot and killed ohnesorg , also needed to be reassessed .
" there is no statute of limitations on murder " the policeman , karl-heinz kurras , is still alive .
he 's 81 years old and could face a new trial .
charges have already been brought against him by carl-wolfgang holzapfel , head of an organization for the victims of stalinism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-heinz kurras -lrb- left -rrb- was on trial twice but both times aquitted .
" there is no statute of limitations on murder , " holzapfel said in a statement released after historians sifting through old files of east germany 's stasi discovered the link to kurras .
but , since the files apparently do not contain information suggesting that the stasi explicitly ordered the liquidation of ohnesorg , it is unlikely that kurras would be convicted .
26-year old benno ohnesorg was shot dead on june 2 , 1967 , after demonstrations protesting the visit of the shah of iran to berlin had turned violent .
the bullet came from kurras who was a west german policeman .
after the shooting , he was tried for reckless manslaughter but acquitted due to a lack of evidence .
after the shooting , the stasi broke off communications with their spy in west berlin in a final message which read : " destroy all material .
cease work for now .
event is viewed as very regrettable accident . "
the incident was a watershed in german politics the case threw germany into chaos .
student protests , which so far had been peaceful , took a sharp turn , becoming more radical and violent .
the death of benno ohnesorg triggered a wave of terror and became the justification for some to take up arms against the state . bildunterschrift : the death of ohnesorg triggered a wave of violent protests across germany .
the so-called red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- under its leaders , andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , began a campaign of violence against germany 's political and business elite , culminating in 1977 in what became known as the " deutsche herbst " , or german autumn .
the raf is believed to be responsible for more than 30 murders and only ended its reign of terror in the early 1990s .
jochen staadt , a historian and head of research on the former east german communist party at berlin 's free university , says that the mere possibility that the killing had been planned by the stasi means that history will have to be re-written. gb / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news that the perpetrator of a 1967 shooting was a spy for east germany 's stasi secret police has sent shockwaves through germany , shedding new light on the country 's postwar history , amid calls for a fresh inquiry . former german interior minister , otto schily , and dirk niebel , general-secretary of germany 's liberal free democrats , have called for a new investigation into the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting in 1967 of student activist benno ohnesorg .
schily , who , before becoming a social democrat and interior minister , was a green party activist and defense lawyer for leftist german terrorists , said the new stasi revelations meant the case had to be " politically and juristically re-evaluated . "
" the files require a very precise re-examination , " he said .
niebel of the fdp urged all parties in parliament " without delay to make way for a no-holds-barred inquiry into stasi involvement in the old west germany . "
berlin 's former spd mayor , klaus schuetz , said the pension claims of the policeman , who shot and killed ohnesorg , also needed to be reassessed .
" there is no statute of limitations on murder " the policeman , karl-heinz kurras , is still alive .
he 's 81 years old and could face a new trial .
charges have already been brought against him by carl-wolfgang holzapfel , head of an organization for the victims of stalinism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-heinz kurras -lrb- left -rrb- was on trial twice but both times aquitted .
" there is no statute of limitations on murder , " holzapfel said in a statement released after historians sifting through old files of east germany 's stasi discovered the link to kurras .
but , since the files apparently do not contain information suggesting that the stasi explicitly ordered the liquidation of ohnesorg , it is unlikely that kurras would be convicted .
26-year old benno ohnesorg was shot dead on june 2 , 1967 , after demonstrations protesting the visit of the shah of iran to berlin had turned violent .
the bullet came from kurras who was a west german policeman .
after the shooting , he was tried for reckless manslaughter but acquitted due to a lack of evidence .
after the shooting , the stasi broke off communications with their spy in west berlin in a final message which read : " destroy all material .
cease work for now .
event is viewed as very regrettable accident . "
the incident was a watershed in german politics the case threw germany into chaos .
student protests , which so far had been peaceful , took a sharp turn , becoming more radical and violent .
the death of benno ohnesorg triggered a wave of terror and became the justification for some to take up arms against the state . bildunterschrift : the death of ohnesorg triggered a wave of violent protests across germany .
the so-called red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- under its leaders , andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , began a campaign of violence against germany 's political and business elite , culminating in 1977 in what became known as the " deutsche herbst " , or german autumn .
the raf is believed to be responsible for more than 30 murders and only ended its reign of terror in the early 1990s .
jochen staadt , a historian and head of research on the former east german communist party at berlin 's free university , says that the mere possibility that the killing had been planned by the stasi means that history will have to be re-written. gb / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stuttgart ended up in third with 64 points , but can still qualify for the champions league .
wolfsburg went up 3-0 after just 26 minutes of play with goals from zvjezdan misimovic , grafite and an own goal by werder 's sebastian proedl .
bremen pulled one back through diego before wolfsburg 's striker duo grafite and edin dzeko sealed the title with two second half goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite , left , scored two goals against bremen " it 's completely mad to have won the championship , " said dzeko .
" it 's a great feeling - we are going to do a lot of celebrating tonight . "
wolfsburg coach , felix magath , who was fired by munich only two years ago , led the team to its maiden title .
magath however wo n't be around to coach wolfsburg for the champions league - he 's decided to move to schalke next season .
" i knew that we were good enough , " said magath .
" we put in some good performances all season and we deserved to be champions .
of course , it will be hard to leave now . "
it has been an astonishing turn around for wolfsburg , which almost faced relegation last year .
few would have expected their side to have a chance at the trophy , the team was clearly an outsider at the start of the season .
saturday 's win over bremen wrapped up one of the biggest sensations the bundesliga has ever seen - and the credits for the success go to the coach , says soccer analyst paul chapman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach felix magath was the mastermind behind wolfsburg 's success " some people say magath took a middle of the road team , but he did n't .
he took a really bad and struggling team that had finished close to relegation for two seasons running . "
" magath started with nothing and he brought in lots of new players , a lot of young exciting talent .
wolfsburg has played wonderful attacking football this season .
they absolutely deserve to be champions . "
the uefa qualifiers in the bundesliga for next season are hertha bsc berlin and the hamburger sv , which finished 4th and 5th respectively .
at the bottom end of the german league standings , arminia bielefeld finished last , followed by karlsruhe sc , with both now relegated to the second division .
karlsruhe , at least , went out in style thrashing a hapless hertha bsc berlin 4-0 in its final first division game .
despite beating leverkusen 3-0 , energie cottbus , which ended the season in 16th place as the third worst team , faces a relegation round against either mainz or nuremberg of the second division , to decide who gets the last remaining spot in next season 's bundesliga. gb / dpa / sid / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news that the perpetrator of a 1967 shooting was a spy for east germany 's stasi secret police has sent shockwaves through germany , shedding new light on the country 's postwar history , amid calls for a fresh inquiry . former german interior minister , otto schily , and dirk niebel , general-secretary of germany 's liberal free democrats , have called for a new investigation into the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting in 1967 of student activist benno ohnesorg .
schily , who , before becoming a social democrat and interior minister , was a green party activist and defense lawyer for leftist german terrorists , said the new stasi revelations meant the case had to be " politically and juristically re-evaluated . "
" the files require a very precise re-examination , " he said .
niebel of the fdp urged all parties in parliament " without delay to make way for a no-holds-barred inquiry into stasi involvement in the old west germany . "
berlin 's former spd mayor , klaus schuetz , said the pension claims of the policeman , who shot and killed ohnesorg , also needed to be reassessed .
" there is no statute of limitations on murder " the policeman , karl-heinz kurras , is still alive .
he 's 81 years old and could face a new trial .
charges have already been brought against him by carl-wolfgang holzapfel , head of an organization for the victims of stalinism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-heinz kurras -lrb- left -rrb- was on trial twice but both times aquitted .
" there is no statute of limitations on murder , " holzapfel said in a statement released after historians sifting through old files of east germany 's stasi discovered the link to kurras .
but , since the files apparently do not contain information suggesting that the stasi explicitly ordered the liquidation of ohnesorg , it is unlikely that kurras would be convicted .
26-year old benno ohnesorg was shot dead on june 2 , 1967 , after demonstrations protesting the visit of the shah of iran to berlin had turned violent .
the bullet came from kurras who was a west german policeman .
after the shooting , he was tried for reckless manslaughter but acquitted due to a lack of evidence .
after the shooting , the stasi broke off communications with their spy in west berlin in a final message which read : " destroy all material .
cease work for now .
event is viewed as very regrettable accident . "
the incident was a watershed in german politics the case threw germany into chaos .
student protests , which so far had been peaceful , took a sharp turn , becoming more radical and violent .
the death of benno ohnesorg triggered a wave of terror and became the justification for some to take up arms against the state . bildunterschrift : the death of ohnesorg triggered a wave of violent protests across germany .
the so-called red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- under its leaders , andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , began a campaign of violence against germany 's political and business elite , culminating in 1977 in what became known as the " deutsche herbst " , or german autumn .
the raf is believed to be responsible for more than 30 murders and only ended its reign of terror in the early 1990s .
jochen staadt , a historian and head of research on the former east german communist party at berlin 's free university , says that the mere possibility that the killing had been planned by the stasi means that history will have to be re-written. gb / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european foreign ministers will be putting pressure on burma at an asia-europe meeting next week to end the trial of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . the global financial crisis will be at the top of the agenda of the asia-europe foreign ministers ' -lrb- asem -rrb- meeting in hanoi on monday and tuesday , but the human rights situation in burma is still likely to steal the headlines .
the european union is mulling over tougher sanctions against the burmese military junta because of suu kyi 's trial , which started on monday , may 18 .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
british foreign secretary david miliband called the proceedings against suu kyi a " show trial . "
" we need to make sure that the burmese regime understands fully the risks that it 's taking , " he said .
sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said the issue would be discussed at the asem conference in hanoi .
burma is expected to attend the meeting .
what will the neighbors say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi was put on trial after a us man swam across a lake to visit her in her home eu ministers said it was the duty of burma 's neighbors to put political pressure on the regime .
the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , which includes burma , has described the suu kyi trial as threatening the regime 's " honor and credibility " and repeated calls for her release .
asean , however , has a policy of non-interference and is unlikely to back its words with actions .
according to china , burma should be left alone to handle its internal affairs . if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
suu kyi has been detained for more than 13 of the past 19 years , most of them at her home in rangoon. ch / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 24.05.2009 germany looks ahead to september 's election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the presidential vote a signal for september 's general election ?
with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .

european foreign ministers will be putting pressure on burma at an asia-europe meeting next week to end the trial of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . the global financial crisis will be at the top of the agenda of the asia-europe foreign ministers ' -lrb- asem -rrb- meeting in hanoi on monday and tuesday , but the human rights situation in burma is still likely to steal the headlines .
the european union is mulling over tougher sanctions against the burmese military junta because of suu kyi 's trial , which started on monday , may 18 .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
british foreign secretary david miliband called the proceedings against suu kyi a " show trial . "

asean , however , has a policy of non-interference and is unlikely to back its words with actions .
according to china , burma should be left alone to handle its internal affairs . if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .

european foreign ministers will be putting pressure on burma at an asia-europe meeting next week to end the trial of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . the global financial crisis will be at the top of the agenda of the asia-europe foreign ministers ' -lrb- asem -rrb- meeting in hanoi on monday and tuesday , but the human rights situation in burma is still likely to steal the headlines .
the european union is mulling over tougher sanctions against the burmese military junta because of suu kyi 's trial , which started on monday , may 18 .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
british foreign secretary david miliband called the proceedings against suu kyi a " show trial . "
" we need to make sure that the burmese regime understands fully the risks that it 's taking , " he said .
sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said the issue would be discussed at the asem conference in hanoi .
burma is expected to attend the meeting .
what will the neighbors say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi was put on trial after a us man swam across a lake to visit her in her home eu ministers said it was the duty of burma 's neighbors to put political pressure on the regime .
the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , which includes burma , has described the suu kyi trial as threatening the regime 's " honor and credibility " and repeated calls for her release .
asean , however , has a policy of non-interference and is unlikely to back its words with actions .
according to china , burma should be left alone to handle its internal affairs . if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
suu kyi has been detained for more than 13 of the past 19 years , most of them at her home in rangoon. ch / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we now have three offers to take over opel , " guttenberg told the newspaper bild am sontag on sunday , may 23 .
" that does not mean that one of them will automatically and urgently take effect . "
" firstly , we need a high degree of certainty that the considerable sum of taxpayers ' money we will have to put up is not lost .
none of the three plans sufficiently meets these requirements at present , " the minister said .
guttenberg said germany 's preference would be made known next week , but did not rule out opel going into bankruptcy if the final bids failed to meet berlin 's requirements .
" if the shortcomings are not lifted , then controlled insolvency would clearly be a better solution , " he said .
" it , too , could open possibilities for opel 's future . "
three bidders in the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg sees shortcomings in all the submitted bids canadian-austrian car parts and assembly group magna , fiat of italy and the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
china 's beijing automotive industry holding co .
-lrb- baic -rrb- has also expressed interest in securing a stake , but has not formally made an offer .
magna , which has pledged to keep all opel plants in germany open but slash 10 percent of the 25,000 workforce , has emerged as the front-runner to take over the carmaker .
but leaders of the four german states where opel has factories were divided on the offer .
the governor of the german rhineland-palatinate state , kurt beck , said that the negotiations would continue with all of the bidders , but that the " main focus " would stay on magna .
north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers , however , rejected the plan as " unacceptable " and " unfair " because of the 2,200 jobs that would be at risk in his home state .
according to press reports , magna was expected to ask the german government for five billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in guarantees , while fiat was reported to be requesting seven billion euros .
german officials declined to comment these figures .
job cuts a must fiat chairman sergio marchionne told bild am sonntag that a maximum of 2,000 jobs would be lost in germany under a revised bid submitted by the italian carmaker .
canada-based magna , which has extensive operations in austria , filed its proposal in conjunction with russia automotive group gaz and russia 's sberbank .
the final decision on the future of gm 's european operation will be reached by gm and the us government , but germany has a stake in the decision as any outcome is likely to rely on german state guarantees .
meanwhile , gm must present the us government with a viable strategy for survival by may 29 or risk possible bankruptcy. hf / dpa / afp / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ban said that only a small portion of the business world has made climate change a top priority .

" the smart money is on the green economy , " he said .
" leaders sometimes are weak because they are short-sighted to get the votes . "

" we now have three offers to take over opel , " guttenberg told the newspaper bild am sontag on sunday , may 23 .
" that does not mean that one of them will automatically and urgently take effect . "
" firstly , we need a high degree of certainty that the considerable sum of taxpayers ' money we will have to put up is not lost .
none of the three plans sufficiently meets these requirements at present , " the minister said .
guttenberg said germany 's preference would be made known next week , but did not rule out opel going into bankruptcy if the final bids failed to meet berlin 's requirements .
" if the shortcomings are not lifted , then controlled insolvency would clearly be a better solution , " he said .
" it , too , could open possibilities for opel 's future . "
three bidders in the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg sees shortcomings in all the submitted bids canadian-austrian car parts and assembly group magna , fiat of italy and the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
china 's beijing automotive industry holding co .
-lrb- baic -rrb- has also expressed interest in securing a stake , but has not formally made an offer .
magna , which has pledged to keep all opel plants in germany open but slash 10 percent of the 25,000 workforce , has emerged as the front-runner to take over the carmaker .
but leaders of the four german states where opel has factories were divided on the offer .
the governor of the german rhineland-palatinate state , kurt beck , said that the negotiations would continue with all of the bidders , but that the " main focus " would stay on magna .
north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers , however , rejected the plan as " unacceptable " and " unfair " because of the 2,200 jobs that would be at risk in his home state .
according to press reports , magna was expected to ask the german government for five billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in guarantees , while fiat was reported to be requesting seven billion euros .
german officials declined to comment these figures .
job cuts a must fiat chairman sergio marchionne told bild am sonntag that a maximum of 2,000 jobs would be lost in germany under a revised bid submitted by the italian carmaker .
canada-based magna , which has extensive operations in austria , filed its proposal in conjunction with russia automotive group gaz and russia 's sberbank .
the final decision on the future of gm 's european operation will be reached by gm and the us government , but germany has a stake in the decision as any outcome is likely to rely on german state guarantees .
meanwhile , gm must present the us government with a viable strategy for survival by may 29 or risk possible bankruptcy. hf / dpa / afp / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european foreign ministers will be putting pressure on burma at an asia-europe meeting next week to end the trial of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . the global financial crisis will be at the top of the agenda of the asia-europe foreign ministers ' -lrb- asem -rrb- meeting in hanoi on monday and tuesday , but the human rights situation in burma is still likely to steal the headlines .
the european union is mulling over tougher sanctions against the burmese military junta because of suu kyi 's trial , which started on monday , may 18 .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
british foreign secretary david miliband called the proceedings against suu kyi a " show trial . "
" we need to make sure that the burmese regime understands fully the risks that it 's taking , " he said .
sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said the issue would be discussed at the asem conference in hanoi .
burma is expected to attend the meeting .
what will the neighbors say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi was put on trial after a us man swam across a lake to visit her in her home eu ministers said it was the duty of burma 's neighbors to put political pressure on the regime .
the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , which includes burma , has described the suu kyi trial as threatening the regime 's " honor and credibility " and repeated calls for her release .
asean , however , has a policy of non-interference and is unlikely to back its words with actions .
according to china , burma should be left alone to handle its internal affairs . if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
suu kyi has been detained for more than 13 of the past 19 years , most of them at her home in rangoon. ch / reuters / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .
" it will be very close this fall , " predicts juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the general election. gb / dw / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the smart money is on the green economy , " he said .
" leaders sometimes are weak because they are short-sighted to get the votes . "
executives from leading companies such as intel , bp and siemens are using the three-day summit to discuss ways business could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions without damaging economic growth .

with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .

stuttgart ended up in third with 64 points , but can still qualify for the champions league .
wolfsburg went up 3-0 after just 26 minutes of play with goals from zvjezdan misimovic , grafite and an own goal by werder 's sebastian proedl .
bremen pulled one back through diego before wolfsburg 's striker duo grafite and edin dzeko sealed the title with two second half goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite , left , scored two goals against bremen " it 's completely mad to have won the championship , " said dzeko .
" it 's a great feeling - we are going to do a lot of celebrating tonight . "
wolfsburg coach , felix magath , who was fired by munich only two years ago , led the team to its maiden title .
magath however wo n't be around to coach wolfsburg for the champions league - he 's decided to move to schalke next season .
" i knew that we were good enough , " said magath .
" we put in some good performances all season and we deserved to be champions .
of course , it will be hard to leave now . "
it has been an astonishing turn around for wolfsburg , which almost faced relegation last year .
few would have expected their side to have a chance at the trophy , the team was clearly an outsider at the start of the season .
saturday 's win over bremen wrapped up one of the biggest sensations the bundesliga has ever seen - and the credits for the success go to the coach , says soccer analyst paul chapman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach felix magath was the mastermind behind wolfsburg 's success " some people say magath took a middle of the road team , but he did n't .
he took a really bad and struggling team that had finished close to relegation for two seasons running . "
" magath started with nothing and he brought in lots of new players , a lot of young exciting talent .
wolfsburg has played wonderful attacking football this season .
they absolutely deserve to be champions . "
the uefa qualifiers in the bundesliga for next season are hertha bsc berlin and the hamburger sv , which finished 4th and 5th respectively .
at the bottom end of the german league standings , arminia bielefeld finished last , followed by karlsruhe sc , with both now relegated to the second division .
karlsruhe , at least , went out in style thrashing a hapless hertha bsc berlin 4-0 in its final first division game .
despite beating leverkusen 3-0 , energie cottbus , which ended the season in 16th place as the third worst team , faces a relegation round against either mainz or nuremberg of the second division , to decide who gets the last remaining spot in next season 's bundesliga. gb / dpa / sid / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 24.05.2009 germany looks ahead to september 's election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the presidential vote a signal for september 's general election ?
with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .

with horst koehler re-elected as germany 's president , political parties and pundits are busy analyzing the implications of the vote as to who will grasp power in the bundestag .
general elections are due in september . not surprisingly , the head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat parliamentary group , volker kauder , interpreted koehler 's easy victory in the first round of voting as a positive signal for his party .
" the message from this election , " kauder said on national television , " is that the mainstream majority can prevail . "
" for the mainstream majority of the union and fdp , this is a delightful outcome and a reason to be confident , " said kauder , referring to the conservative sister parties of christian democrats and christian social union and the liberal free democrats .
" the mainstream can prevail " the vote in the federal convention illustrated that " when we are in a situation that matters , we have what it takes to ensure stability , " kauder explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler is happy to serve a second term immediately after the vote , chancellor merkel , csu chairman horst seehofer and fdp leader guido westerwelle all said that the result was a signal pointing toward mutual success in september 's parliamentary election .
merkel stressed that the outcome showed " that what we wanted to happen did happen , together , and not alone . "
understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .

understandably , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are seeking a majority of their own in september without the cdu / csu and fdp , saw no signal effect whatsoever from koehler 's re-election .
the defeat of their candidate , gesine schwan , " has nothing to do with the outcome of the next federal election , " said spd chairman franz muentefering .
left party chairman , oskar lafontaine , agreed with that assessment , saying he " was convinced " that there would be no cdu-fdp majority after the general election .
the pitfalls of politics political analyst gerd langguth from the university of bonn , who has written a book on horst koehler , went as far as to say that there were some parliamentary deputies in the spd who were happy that koehler was chosen quickly in the first round of voting , in which the spd 's schwan and the left party candidate peter sodann competed against one another .
" if there had been a third round of voting , it could have come to a coalition between the spd and the left party , which would have cast a long shadow over the campaign trail in the coming months , " langguth explained in an interview with the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal assembly met on may 23 to elect the president had this been the case , the cdu / csu and fdp would have repeatedly made a point of this during the campaign , warning of the dangers of an spd-left coalition , langguth said .
" that 's why , in the medium term , this defeat could end up being an advantage , " langguth says .
the green party has its own interpretation of koehler 's election .
the greens see his wafer-thin majority with the help of votes from the independent voter group , freie waehler , as a sign that the cdu / csu and fdp do not have enough votes to ensure a majority on their own .
" it will be very close this fall , " predicts juergen trittin , the green party 's top candidate for the general election. gb / dw / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stuttgart ended up in third with 64 points , but can still qualify for the champions league .
wolfsburg went up 3-0 after just 26 minutes of play with goals from zvjezdan misimovic , grafite and an own goal by werder 's sebastian proedl .
bremen pulled one back through diego before wolfsburg 's striker duo grafite and edin dzeko sealed the title with two second half goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's grafite , left , scored two goals against bremen " it 's completely mad to have won the championship , " said dzeko .
" it 's a great feeling - we are going to do a lot of celebrating tonight . "
wolfsburg coach , felix magath , who was fired by munich only two years ago , led the team to its maiden title .
magath however wo n't be around to coach wolfsburg for the champions league - he 's decided to move to schalke next season .
" i knew that we were good enough , " said magath .
" we put in some good performances all season and we deserved to be champions .
of course , it will be hard to leave now . "
it has been an astonishing turn around for wolfsburg , which almost faced relegation last year .
few would have expected their side to have a chance at the trophy , the team was clearly an outsider at the start of the season .
saturday 's win over bremen wrapped up one of the biggest sensations the bundesliga has ever seen - and the credits for the success go to the coach , says soccer analyst paul chapman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach felix magath was the mastermind behind wolfsburg 's success " some people say magath took a middle of the road team , but he did n't .
he took a really bad and struggling team that had finished close to relegation for two seasons running . "
" magath started with nothing and he brought in lots of new players , a lot of young exciting talent .
wolfsburg has played wonderful attacking football this season .
they absolutely deserve to be champions . "
the uefa qualifiers in the bundesliga for next season are hertha bsc berlin and the hamburger sv , which finished 4th and 5th respectively .
at the bottom end of the german league standings , arminia bielefeld finished last , followed by karlsruhe sc , with both now relegated to the second division .
karlsruhe , at least , went out in style thrashing a hapless hertha bsc berlin 4-0 in its final first division game .
despite beating leverkusen 3-0 , energie cottbus , which ended the season in 16th place as the third worst team , faces a relegation round against either mainz or nuremberg of the second division , to decide who gets the last remaining spot in next season 's bundesliga. gb / dpa / sid / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

advertisement fibi ward and her friends emma , samantha and amber chat about how they felt after her diagnosis when teenager fibi ward was suddenly diagnosed with diabetes last year she was devastated .
she knew virtually nothing about the condition and found that while there was plenty of literature about the medical aspects of living with type 1 diabetes , that there was little information about the emotions .
type 1 diabetes - also known as insulin-dependent diabetes - develops in those whose bodies are unable to produce insulin .
so 14-year-old fibi decided to pen her own book , which she hopes others will find useful .
informing others " there was nothing available that looked at the emotional and psychological effect of being a diabetic - and certainly nothing aimed at children or teenagers , " said fibi from wythnall , near birmingham .
" i 've basically written the book that i would have liked to have read when i was diagnosed .
" i hope that what i 've written will help other children and teenagers who are diagnosed with diabetes .
i hope it will help them understand that having diabetes might be a big deal , but it 's not the end of the world . "
extract from ' no added sugar ' i was fed up with - well everything .
i had n't chosen to be landed with it .
i did n't want to have it .
i was sick of it .
i started to feel down every time i had to do an injection .
it all seemed so unfair .
why me ?
why did i have to do this ?
as well as detailing her experiences fibi 's book ' no added sugar ' also contains advice .
diabetes care advisor , zoe harrison , from diabetes uk , said it would certainly help fill a gap .
" i think a book like this will help .
" we do produce a lot of information , but hearing from other people going through what you are going through helps , " she said .
" some of the biggest problems are related to the fact that they are teenagers and having to deal with all the changes of adolescence as well as their diabetes .
" when someone is diagnosed with diabetes their whole life changes .
they have to come to terms with having injections for life , having to manage their glucose levels and take better care of their health .
" it impacts on all aspects of life , school life , social and home life .
" there is an awful lot to come to terms with . "
reality hits this was certainly the case for fibi , who said she had been terrified by the implications of the condition .
" because of my regime i have to do four injections a day .
that sounded horrendous , but i have got used to it - it is part of a routine .
" when you are first diagnosed it can be hard to tell people , but after a while people will start to find out about it .
children and diabetes type 1 diabetes - also known as insulin-dependent diabetes - develops in those whose bodies are unable to produce insulin classed as an autoimmune disease , type 1 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in children , affecting up to 95 percent of under-16s who have the disease unlike type 2 diabetes - which is more common in adults - type 1 diabetes is not related to lifestyle factors " i was worried about people finding out in case they thought differently of me or that i would stand out as different .
" i was scared , angry and upset , i used to think , why me ?
and i just could n't see how i could ever have a normal life again .
" i was scared i would be bullied about it .
" at first i felt as if i was in a bad dream that i could n't wake up from , and telling people about my diabetes would have just made it much more real .
" it is really horrible to begin with , but you do get past it . "
school support needed fibi said her school has been extremely supportive , offering her the medical room to administer her injections under supervision .
but zoe harrison said others are not as lucky .
insulin is used to treat diabetes " in the uk there is an awful situation in schools in that they are not getting the best care and support at school , " she said .
" they say they are being told they must inject in the toilets that they are not allowed to treat hypos - low blood glucose - or test their blood glucose in class .

advertisement fibi ward and her friends emma , samantha and amber chat about how they felt after her diagnosis when teenager fibi ward was suddenly diagnosed with diabetes last year she was devastated .
she knew virtually nothing about the condition and found that while there was plenty of literature about the medical aspects of living with type 1 diabetes , that there was little information about the emotions .
type 1 diabetes - also known as insulin-dependent diabetes - develops in those whose bodies are unable to produce insulin .
so 14-year-old fibi decided to pen her own book , which she hopes others will find useful .
informing others " there was nothing available that looked at the emotional and psychological effect of being a diabetic - and certainly nothing aimed at children or teenagers , " said fibi from wythnall , near birmingham .
" i 've basically written the book that i would have liked to have read when i was diagnosed .
" i hope that what i 've written will help other children and teenagers who are diagnosed with diabetes .
i hope it will help them understand that having diabetes might be a big deal , but it 's not the end of the world . "
extract from ' no added sugar ' i was fed up with - well everything .
i had n't chosen to be landed with it .
i did n't want to have it .
i was sick of it .
i started to feel down every time i had to do an injection .
it all seemed so unfair .
why me ?
why did i have to do this ?
as well as detailing her experiences fibi 's book ' no added sugar ' also contains advice .
diabetes care advisor , zoe harrison , from diabetes uk , said it would certainly help fill a gap .
" i think a book like this will help .
" we do produce a lot of information , but hearing from other people going through what you are going through helps , " she said .
" some of the biggest problems are related to the fact that they are teenagers and having to deal with all the changes of adolescence as well as their diabetes .
" when someone is diagnosed with diabetes their whole life changes .
they have to come to terms with having injections for life , having to manage their glucose levels and take better care of their health .
" it impacts on all aspects of life , school life , social and home life .
" there is an awful lot to come to terms with . "
reality hits this was certainly the case for fibi , who said she had been terrified by the implications of the condition .
" because of my regime i have to do four injections a day .
that sounded horrendous , but i have got used to it - it is part of a routine .
" when you are first diagnosed it can be hard to tell people , but after a while people will start to find out about it .
children and diabetes type 1 diabetes - also known as insulin-dependent diabetes - develops in those whose bodies are unable to produce insulin classed as an autoimmune disease , type 1 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in children , affecting up to 95 percent of under-16s who have the disease unlike type 2 diabetes - which is more common in adults - type 1 diabetes is not related to lifestyle factors " i was worried about people finding out in case they thought differently of me or that i would stand out as different .
" i was scared , angry and upset , i used to think , why me ?
and i just could n't see how i could ever have a normal life again .
" i was scared i would be bullied about it .
" at first i felt as if i was in a bad dream that i could n't wake up from , and telling people about my diabetes would have just made it much more real .
" it is really horrible to begin with , but you do get past it . "
school support needed fibi said her school has been extremely supportive , offering her the medical room to administer her injections under supervision .
but zoe harrison said others are not as lucky .
insulin is used to treat diabetes " in the uk there is an awful situation in schools in that they are not getting the best care and support at school , " she said .
" they say they are being told they must inject in the toilets that they are not allowed to treat hypos - low blood glucose - or test their blood glucose in class .
" parents having to go into school to give injections to younger children , some children are even being excluded from school trips . "

advertisement fibi ward and her friends emma , samantha and amber chat about how they felt after her diagnosis when teenager fibi ward was suddenly diagnosed with diabetes last year she was devastated .
she knew virtually nothing about the condition and found that while there was plenty of literature about the medical aspects of living with type 1 diabetes , that there was little information about the emotions .
type 1 diabetes - also known as insulin-dependent diabetes - develops in those whose bodies are unable to produce insulin .
so 14-year-old fibi decided to pen her own book , which she hopes others will find useful .
informing others " there was nothing available that looked at the emotional and psychological effect of being a diabetic - and certainly nothing aimed at children or teenagers , " said fibi from wythnall , near birmingham .
" i 've basically written the book that i would have liked to have read when i was diagnosed .
" i hope that what i 've written will help other children and teenagers who are diagnosed with diabetes .
i hope it will help them understand that having diabetes might be a big deal , but it 's not the end of the world . "
extract from ' no added sugar ' i was fed up with - well everything .
i had n't chosen to be landed with it .
i did n't want to have it .
i was sick of it .
i started to feel down every time i had to do an injection .
it all seemed so unfair .
why me ?
why did i have to do this ?
as well as detailing her experiences fibi 's book ' no added sugar ' also contains advice .
diabetes care advisor , zoe harrison , from diabetes uk , said it would certainly help fill a gap .
" i think a book like this will help .
" we do produce a lot of information , but hearing from other people going through what you are going through helps , " she said .
" some of the biggest problems are related to the fact that they are teenagers and having to deal with all the changes of adolescence as well as their diabetes .
" when someone is diagnosed with diabetes their whole life changes .
they have to come to terms with having injections for life , having to manage their glucose levels and take better care of their health .
" it impacts on all aspects of life , school life , social and home life .
" there is an awful lot to come to terms with . "
reality hits this was certainly the case for fibi , who said she had been terrified by the implications of the condition .
" because of my regime i have to do four injections a day .
that sounded horrendous , but i have got used to it - it is part of a routine .
" when you are first diagnosed it can be hard to tell people , but after a while people will start to find out about it .
children and diabetes type 1 diabetes - also known as insulin-dependent diabetes - develops in those whose bodies are unable to produce insulin classed as an autoimmune disease , type 1 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in children , affecting up to 95 percent of under-16s who have the disease unlike type 2 diabetes - which is more common in adults - type 1 diabetes is not related to lifestyle factors " i was worried about people finding out in case they thought differently of me or that i would stand out as different .
" i was scared , angry and upset , i used to think , why me ?
and i just could n't see how i could ever have a normal life again .
" i was scared i would be bullied about it .
" at first i felt as if i was in a bad dream that i could n't wake up from , and telling people about my diabetes would have just made it much more real .
" it is really horrible to begin with , but you do get past it . "
school support needed fibi said her school has been extremely supportive , offering her the medical room to administer her injections under supervision .
but zoe harrison said others are not as lucky .
insulin is used to treat diabetes " in the uk there is an awful situation in schools in that they are not getting the best care and support at school , " she said .
" they say they are being told they must inject in the toilets that they are not allowed to treat hypos - low blood glucose - or test their blood glucose in class .
" parents having to go into school to give injections to younger children , some children are even being excluded from school trips . "

in his second report from the science beyond fiction expo in prague , dan simmons meets scientists trying to develop robots that behave like humans .

how bots are learning to collaborate with each other simple tasks such as walking and picking up objects are part of everyday life for people , but such mundane tasks still present major challenges for today 's robots .
researchers are using sensors , cameras and recognition to teach the machines to interact in a way that people will be comfortable with .
rachid alami , senior scientist at the national centre for scientific research in france , said that actions by robots should be easily interpreted by humans .
rachid alami said robots needs to be optimized for dealing with people " generally the engineers optimize the energy , optimize the time but do not optimize the acceptability and legibility of the -lsb- robot 's -rsb- task , " he said .
human movement is fluid and adaptable because people learn how to move unaided and without a stream of conscious instructions from the brain .
few modern robots can replicate a smooth sequence of movements in the same way .
but , say scientists , once they do master it machines could become useful in the fields such as neuroscience .
but the advantages do not lie wholly in human hands .
robots can perform some tasks that people find difficult .
at the show one robot was shown to balance a ball successfully thanks to feedback from light sensors .

how bots could one day move like a person the sensors tell it where to move next to keep the ball up - such precision and speed will be important if robots are ever to achieve good balance .
smart pool some robots are learning to collaborate in a swarm-like way by communicating where they are and what they have found out .
" the system is very reliable because when a part of the system is out of order or destroyed , others can take this role and the whole system still works , " said serge kernback from the university of stuttgart .
he added that this new kind of self-organisation suggests " there is still frontiers in robotic research " .
machines are better at some tasks such as balancing a ball one robot called noa at the science beyond fiction expo was able to pick up objects after being fed pictures wirelessly from a camera above it .
noa knows that a ball will sit on a cube but a cube will not sit on a ball , but its intelligence is thin - based on pre-programmed learning sequences .
researchers eventually want machines to be able to find the answers to their own questions about tasks .
to make this a reality , scientists have been studying the brainwaves of rats .
stefan schaffelhofer , researcher at medical and electrical engineering firm guger technologies , said it is possible to reconstruct the physical position of an animal from brainwaves by using plate cell neurons .
" it 's like gps but using brainwaves instead of satellites , explained mr schaffelhofer .
" knowing how the brain deals with the space around us could for example help people with disabilities control robotic aides in future in a very natural way , " he added .
