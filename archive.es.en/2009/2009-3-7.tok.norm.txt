some are a bit too excited about the new us administration , says dw 's christoph hasselbach , but this may be the beginning of something good . such a relaxed atmosphere and so much applause and smiling - hillary clinton 's visit with her nato counterparts and the eu in brussels was like one big party .
europe 's relief over the change in the white house can be tangibly felt in europe .
following the arrogance of the bush years , now it 's time for true cooperation .
it 's as though the entire continent has let out a big sigh and wants to give hillary a big hug .
her visit in brussels and the overall effect of obama 's administration in europe stand in stark contrast to the previous administration , particularly when it comes to tone .
but people are already asking critical questions here : is it all just talk ?
and are the bush and obama governments really that different from one another when it comes down to daily business ?
the real proof remains to be seen , since obama has only been in office for a few weeks .
clinton herself brought a serious note to the air of exuberance .
" we do n't have a choice , we have to come together , " she said , pointing to the worst economic crisis in decades .
just understanding each other is n't enough .
politicians do n't come together to say how much they like each other .
they have an obligation to solve problems .
but it 's an enormous help if the chemistry is already there .
a little too much chemistry ?
however , it 's a little strange that the chemistry here seems to be so right across the board .
the enthusiasm in europe is so ubiquitous that it 's suspicious .
perhaps the most significant - and the most suspicious - is that from the leading british politicians .
suddenly they find everything that obama says great , while they used to find everything that bush said great .
despite some opportunism on the european side , there truly is a stronger connection between the us and europe .
this must be used to combat the crisis .
in a dire situation , both sides not only recognize that they need each other , but also how much they have in common and that they can do more together than they can alone .
looking back on it , this global financial crisis just might prove to be the birth of a new trans-atlantic partnership . author : christoph hasselbach editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for juergen klinsmann , saturday 's match against hanover 96 is a big test . one win in five bundesliga matches is not enough to satisfy the high demands of soccer fans in munich , and now that bayern is out of the running for the dfb cup , speculation is rife about the future of juergen klinsmann , who has held the head coaching position at bayern for just eight months .
despite an enthusiastic welcome at the beginning of his post in munich , the tides have quickly turned for klinsmann following a 4-2 loss to bayer leverkusen on wednesday that eliminated bayern from the dfb cup .
klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .
“ we need to stay calm and take care of what 's ahead . ”
a challenge in hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philipp lahm is set to return for bayern this weekend against hanover hanover 96 beat bayern 1-0 in the first half of the season , which does not help bolster confidence in munich for saturday 's match .
despite playing at home , klinsmann must still overcome potential holes in his roster come kick-off .
midfielders franck ribery , tim borowski , and bastian schweinsteiger , as well as striker luca toni , are all doubtful to play on saturday due to injury . team captain mark van bommel is definitely out with a suspension due to an accumulation of five yellow cards .
the one bright spot for klinsmann is the likely return of defender philipp lahm , who has been recovering from an illness .
one thing is certain for klinsmann , no matter who ends up on the pitch saturday : bayern has got to play more consistently in the bundesliga .
" this team has shown its quality , " says klinsmann .
" we 've played some great matches in the champion 's league .
the players are really caught up in the champion 's league , but they ca n't lose sight of their duties in the bundesliga .
we 've been coming up a bit short in the bundesliga lately , and you ca n't win when you 're only giving 95 percent . "
a visit ends saturday 's match against hanover marks the final day of american landon donovan 's short stint with bayern .
donovan has been on loan to bayern from the los angeles galaxy , his home club in the mls .
the galaxy has reported that donovan is expected to train with them on tuesday in preparation for their season opener against dc united on march 22 .

the frigate apprehended them when the pirates attacked the german merchant vessel " mv courier " off somalia with anti-tank missiles and firearms . this was the first time in germany 's modern history that its navy had made any apprehensions at sea . according to a report by broadcaster zdf , prosecution officials said there were enough grounds for prosecuting the pirates in germany .
however , the court must first decide whether german interests were at stake during the attack . question of endangered german interests since the " mv courier , " which is owned by a bremen-based shipping company , had been sailing under an antiguan flag with a non-german crew , this could be questionable . also , the german interior ministry earlier this week had said there were no grounds for a german prosecution of the captured men , as no german interests were considered endangered in the attack . for this reason the deal with kenya was crucial , as it has cleared the way for the nine men to be handed over to face prosecution there .
theoretically , the pirates could also apply for asylum in kenya once on land . kjb / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some are a bit too excited about the new us administration , says dw 's christoph hasselbach , but this may be the beginning of something good . such a relaxed atmosphere and so much applause and smiling - hillary clinton 's visit with her nato counterparts and the eu in brussels was like one big party .
europe 's relief over the change in the white house can be tangibly felt in europe .
following the arrogance of the bush years , now it 's time for true cooperation .
it 's as though the entire continent has let out a big sigh and wants to give hillary a big hug .
her visit in brussels and the overall effect of obama 's administration in europe stand in stark contrast to the previous administration , particularly when it comes to tone .
but people are already asking critical questions here : is it all just talk ?
and are the bush and obama governments really that different from one another when it comes down to daily business ?
the real proof remains to be seen , since obama has only been in office for a few weeks .
clinton herself brought a serious note to the air of exuberance .
" we do n't have a choice , we have to come together , " she said , pointing to the worst economic crisis in decades .
just understanding each other is n't enough .
politicians do n't come together to say how much they like each other .
they have an obligation to solve problems .
but it 's an enormous help if the chemistry is already there .
a little too much chemistry ?
however , it 's a little strange that the chemistry here seems to be so right across the board .
the enthusiasm in europe is so ubiquitous that it 's suspicious .
perhaps the most significant - and the most suspicious - is that from the leading british politicians .
suddenly they find everything that obama says great , while they used to find everything that bush said great .
despite some opportunism on the european side , there truly is a stronger connection between the us and europe .
this must be used to combat the crisis .
in a dire situation , both sides not only recognize that they need each other , but also how much they have in common and that they can do more together than they can alone .
looking back on it , this global financial crisis just might prove to be the birth of a new trans-atlantic partnership . author : christoph hasselbach editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will tell president obama that he will find a warm welcome , " clinton said at a joint press conference with babacan .
clinton in particular praised turkey for its role in mediating peace talks between israel and syria , saying that the talks were a part of the overall mideast peace process .
" the importance of this tract of the peace process can not be overstated , " clinton said .
return to the negotiating table ?
turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton , left , also met with turkish prime minister erdogan babacan said that once the conditions were right and both sides were ready to again start the talks , turkey would be ready once again to play a mediating role .
clinton also said that two us representatives are currently holding talks in damascus .
asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .
the united states already shares intelligence with turkey concerning pkk separatist rebels based in mountainous northern iraq from where they launch raids on turkey .

some are a bit too excited about the new us administration , says dw 's christoph hasselbach , but this may be the beginning of something good . such a relaxed atmosphere and so much applause and smiling - hillary clinton 's visit with her nato counterparts and the eu in brussels was like one big party .
europe 's relief over the change in the white house can be tangibly felt in europe .
following the arrogance of the bush years , now it 's time for true cooperation .
it 's as though the entire continent has let out a big sigh and wants to give hillary a big hug .
her visit in brussels and the overall effect of obama 's administration in europe stand in stark contrast to the previous administration , particularly when it comes to tone .
but people are already asking critical questions here : is it all just talk ?

" i will tell president obama that he will find a warm welcome , " clinton said at a joint press conference with babacan .
clinton in particular praised turkey for its role in mediating peace talks between israel and syria , saying that the talks were a part of the overall mideast peace process .
" the importance of this tract of the peace process can not be overstated , " clinton said .
return to the negotiating table ?
turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton , left , also met with turkish prime minister erdogan babacan said that once the conditions were right and both sides were ready to again start the talks , turkey would be ready once again to play a mediating role .
clinton also said that two us representatives are currently holding talks in damascus .
asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .
the united states already shares intelligence with turkey concerning pkk separatist rebels based in mountainous northern iraq from where they launch raids on turkey .
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war led to a chill in relations between the us and turkey clinton 's visit to turkey and the announcement of obama 's visit is a part of the new us administration 's attempt to improving ties between the two nato members .
us-turkish relations hit a low point in 2003 after the us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion .
turkish public opinion was overwhelmingly against the war and surveys showed a dramatic fall in the general public 's view of the united states .
" the -lrb- barack -rrb- obama administration has a chance to rebuild on a better footing after the most acute problems accumulated in the bush administration have finally been taken off the table , " said an unnamed senior us official on condition of anonymity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 07.03.2009 klinsmann 's future questioned after dfb cup elimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann faces increased criticism in munich wednesday 's dfb cup elimination has made bayern fans restless , despite last week 's champions league trouncing of lisbon .
for juergen klinsmann , saturday 's match against hanover 96 is a big test . one win in five bundesliga matches is not enough to satisfy the high demands of soccer fans in munich , and now that bayern is out of the running for the dfb cup , speculation is rife about the future of juergen klinsmann , who has held the head coaching position at bayern for just eight months .
despite an enthusiastic welcome at the beginning of his post in munich , the tides have quickly turned for klinsmann following a 4-2 loss to bayer leverkusen on wednesday that eliminated bayern from the dfb cup .
klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .
“ we need to stay calm and take care of what 's ahead . ”
a challenge in hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philipp lahm is set to return for bayern this weekend against hanover hanover 96 beat bayern 1-0 in the first half of the season , which does not help bolster confidence in munich for saturday 's match .
despite playing at home , klinsmann must still overcome potential holes in his roster come kick-off .
midfielders franck ribery , tim borowski , and bastian schweinsteiger , as well as striker luca toni , are all doubtful to play on saturday due to injury . team captain mark van bommel is definitely out with a suspension due to an accumulation of five yellow cards .
the one bright spot for klinsmann is the likely return of defender philipp lahm , who has been recovering from an illness .
one thing is certain for klinsmann , no matter who ends up on the pitch saturday : bayern has got to play more consistently in the bundesliga .
" this team has shown its quality , " says klinsmann .
" we 've played some great matches in the champion 's league .
the players are really caught up in the champion 's league , but they ca n't lose sight of their duties in the bundesliga .
we 've been coming up a bit short in the bundesliga lately , and you ca n't win when you 're only giving 95 percent . "
a visit ends saturday 's match against hanover marks the final day of american landon donovan 's short stint with bayern .
donovan has been on loan to bayern from the los angeles galaxy , his home club in the mls .
the galaxy has reported that donovan is expected to train with them on tuesday in preparation for their season opener against dc united on march 22 .
donovan contributed four goals in five friendly matches for bayern . mz / tt / reuters / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " the chancellor said in her weekly podcast .
" unfortunately , we have not yet reached this point . "
at talks with german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on friday , opel 's us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- promised to revamp a rescue plan dismissed by the government as inadequate .
" the concept needs to be improved and clarified , " said the chancellor , who promised to do everything in her power to find a solution acceptable to opel 's 25,000 employees .
opel has requested 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state guarantees , but is believed to require a much larger sum if it hopes to stay afloat .
massive layoffs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's chancellor is still not ready to commit to a state aid package for opel according to the german weekly der spiegel to be published on monday , the plan submitted to government officials on friday called for the shutdown of factories at bochum in western germany , eisenach in the east and antwerp in northern belgium .
with 11,000 people losing their jobs , according to this scenario , opel would try to save some $ 1.2 billion -lrb- 949 million euros -rrb- in staff costs , the magazine said .
an alternative proposal would be to cut only 3,500 jobs but lower wages across the board , it added .
another weekly , focus , said opel was asking for four billion euros in state aid , not the 3.3 billion reported earlier , though portions of it could come in the form of guarantees or credits .
focus noted that opel had never paid a single cent in taxes to the german state , as any profits it made were transferred to detroit .
complex structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister guttenberg , left , led inconclusive talks with opel the complex ownership structures between opel and its detroit-based parent company need to be taken into consideration before germany pledges any financial assistance , analysts said .
germany is wary of providing state aid to opel without guarantees that the money will not be siphoned off to the united states .

turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .

asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .

the frigate apprehended them when the pirates attacked the german merchant vessel " mv courier " off somalia with anti-tank missiles and firearms . this was the first time in germany 's modern history that its navy had made any apprehensions at sea . according to a report by broadcaster zdf , prosecution officials said there were enough grounds for prosecuting the pirates in germany .
however , the court must first decide whether german interests were at stake during the attack . question of endangered german interests since the " mv courier , " which is owned by a bremen-based shipping company , had been sailing under an antiguan flag with a non-german crew , this could be questionable . also , the german interior ministry earlier this week had said there were no grounds for a german prosecution of the captured men , as no german interests were considered endangered in the attack . for this reason the deal with kenya was crucial , as it has cleared the way for the nine men to be handed over to face prosecution there .
theoretically , the pirates could also apply for asylum in kenya once on land . kjb / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frigate apprehended them when the pirates attacked the german merchant vessel " mv courier " off somalia with anti-tank missiles and firearms . this was the first time in germany 's modern history that its navy had made any apprehensions at sea . according to a report by broadcaster zdf , prosecution officials said there were enough grounds for prosecuting the pirates in germany .
however , the court must first decide whether german interests were at stake during the attack . question of endangered german interests since the " mv courier , " which is owned by a bremen-based shipping company , had been sailing under an antiguan flag with a non-german crew , this could be questionable . also , the german interior ministry earlier this week had said there were no grounds for a german prosecution of the captured men , as no german interests were considered endangered in the attack . for this reason the deal with kenya was crucial , as it has cleared the way for the nine men to be handed over to face prosecution there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 07.03.2009 opinion : clinton 's european visit marks a new beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's enthusiasm over hillary clinton can practically be cut with a knife .
some are a bit too excited about the new us administration , says dw 's christoph hasselbach , but this may be the beginning of something good . such a relaxed atmosphere and so much applause and smiling - hillary clinton 's visit with her nato counterparts and the eu in brussels was like one big party .
europe 's relief over the change in the white house can be tangibly felt in europe .
following the arrogance of the bush years , now it 's time for true cooperation .
it 's as though the entire continent has let out a big sigh and wants to give hillary a big hug .
her visit in brussels and the overall effect of obama 's administration in europe stand in stark contrast to the previous administration , particularly when it comes to tone .
but people are already asking critical questions here : is it all just talk ?
and are the bush and obama governments really that different from one another when it comes down to daily business ?
the real proof remains to be seen , since obama has only been in office for a few weeks .
clinton herself brought a serious note to the air of exuberance .
" we do n't have a choice , we have to come together , " she said , pointing to the worst economic crisis in decades .
just understanding each other is n't enough .
politicians do n't come together to say how much they like each other .
they have an obligation to solve problems .
but it 's an enormous help if the chemistry is already there .
a little too much chemistry ?
however , it 's a little strange that the chemistry here seems to be so right across the board .

" the concept needs to be improved and clarified , " said the chancellor , who promised to do everything in her power to find a solution acceptable to opel 's 25,000 employees .
opel has requested 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state guarantees , but is believed to require a much larger sum if it hopes to stay afloat .
massive layoffs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's chancellor is still not ready to commit to a state aid package for opel according to the german weekly der spiegel to be published on monday , the plan submitted to government officials on friday called for the shutdown of factories at bochum in western germany , eisenach in the east and antwerp in northern belgium .
with 11,000 people losing their jobs , according to this scenario , opel would try to save some $ 1.2 billion -lrb- 949 million euros -rrb- in staff costs , the magazine said .
an alternative proposal would be to cut only 3,500 jobs but lower wages across the board , it added .
another weekly , focus , said opel was asking for four billion euros in state aid , not the 3.3 billion reported earlier , though portions of it could come in the form of guarantees or credits .
focus noted that opel had never paid a single cent in taxes to the german state , as any profits it made were transferred to detroit .
complex structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister guttenberg , left , led inconclusive talks with opel the complex ownership structures between opel and its detroit-based parent company need to be taken into consideration before germany pledges any financial assistance , analysts said .
germany is wary of providing state aid to opel without guarantees that the money will not be siphoned off to the united states .
german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble suggested on friday that opel should consider going into insolvency , saying such a move would not mean that the company would go bankrupt .
on saturday , deputy economics ministry dagmar woehrl said opel could avoid going belly-up only if this quickly provided " an improved outlook . "
she said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " that the government would pump large amounts of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers .
global crisis , local politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many opel employees are fearing for their jobs like many other automobile manufacturers , opel and gm have been hit by a massive fall-off in sales triggered by the global economic downturn .
last week gm posted a $ 30.9-billion loss for 2008 and issued a warning that 2009 would be a challenging year , despite receiving $ 13.4 billion in aid from the us government .
gm has plants operated by subsidiaries belgium , poland , spain and sweden in addition to those in germany and britain .
with general elections due on sept .

" i will tell president obama that he will find a warm welcome , " clinton said at a joint press conference with babacan .
clinton in particular praised turkey for its role in mediating peace talks between israel and syria , saying that the talks were a part of the overall mideast peace process .
" the importance of this tract of the peace process can not be overstated , " clinton said .
return to the negotiating table ?
turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton , left , also met with turkish prime minister erdogan babacan said that once the conditions were right and both sides were ready to again start the talks , turkey would be ready once again to play a mediating role .
clinton also said that two us representatives are currently holding talks in damascus .
asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .
the united states already shares intelligence with turkey concerning pkk separatist rebels based in mountainous northern iraq from where they launch raids on turkey .
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war led to a chill in relations between the us and turkey clinton 's visit to turkey and the announcement of obama 's visit is a part of the new us administration 's attempt to improving ties between the two nato members .
us-turkish relations hit a low point in 2003 after the us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion .
turkish public opinion was overwhelmingly against the war and surveys showed a dramatic fall in the general public 's view of the united states .
" the -lrb- barack -rrb- obama administration has a chance to rebuild on a better footing after the most acute problems accumulated in the bush administration have finally been taken off the table , " said an unnamed senior us official on condition of anonymity .
clinton 's visit to ankara followed a stop in geneva where she held talks with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov .
she also spoke to the european parliament in brussels on friday . kjb / tt / dpa / afp / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 07.03.2009 klinsmann 's future questioned after dfb cup elimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann faces increased criticism in munich wednesday 's dfb cup elimination has made bayern fans restless , despite last week 's champions league trouncing of lisbon .
for juergen klinsmann , saturday 's match against hanover 96 is a big test . one win in five bundesliga matches is not enough to satisfy the high demands of soccer fans in munich , and now that bayern is out of the running for the dfb cup , speculation is rife about the future of juergen klinsmann , who has held the head coaching position at bayern for just eight months .
despite an enthusiastic welcome at the beginning of his post in munich , the tides have quickly turned for klinsmann following a 4-2 loss to bayer leverkusen on wednesday that eliminated bayern from the dfb cup .
klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .
“ we need to stay calm and take care of what 's ahead . ”
a challenge in hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philipp lahm is set to return for bayern this weekend against hanover hanover 96 beat bayern 1-0 in the first half of the season , which does not help bolster confidence in munich for saturday 's match .
despite playing at home , klinsmann must still overcome potential holes in his roster come kick-off .
midfielders franck ribery , tim borowski , and bastian schweinsteiger , as well as striker luca toni , are all doubtful to play on saturday due to injury . team captain mark van bommel is definitely out with a suspension due to an accumulation of five yellow cards .
the one bright spot for klinsmann is the likely return of defender philipp lahm , who has been recovering from an illness .
one thing is certain for klinsmann , no matter who ends up on the pitch saturday : bayern has got to play more consistently in the bundesliga .
" this team has shown its quality , " says klinsmann .
" we 've played some great matches in the champion 's league .
the players are really caught up in the champion 's league , but they ca n't lose sight of their duties in the bundesliga .
we 've been coming up a bit short in the bundesliga lately , and you ca n't win when you 're only giving 95 percent . "
a visit ends saturday 's match against hanover marks the final day of american landon donovan 's short stint with bayern .
donovan has been on loan to bayern from the los angeles galaxy , his home club in the mls .
the galaxy has reported that donovan is expected to train with them on tuesday in preparation for their season opener against dc united on march 22 .

for juergen klinsmann , saturday 's match against hanover 96 is a big test . one win in five bundesliga matches is not enough to satisfy the high demands of soccer fans in munich , and now that bayern is out of the running for the dfb cup , speculation is rife about the future of juergen klinsmann , who has held the head coaching position at bayern for just eight months .
despite an enthusiastic welcome at the beginning of his post in munich , the tides have quickly turned for klinsmann following a 4-2 loss to bayer leverkusen on wednesday that eliminated bayern from the dfb cup .
klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .
“ we need to stay calm and take care of what 's ahead . ”
a challenge in hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philipp lahm is set to return for bayern this weekend against hanover hanover 96 beat bayern 1-0 in the first half of the season , which does not help bolster confidence in munich for saturday 's match .
despite playing at home , klinsmann must still overcome potential holes in his roster come kick-off .
midfielders franck ribery , tim borowski , and bastian schweinsteiger , as well as striker luca toni , are all doubtful to play on saturday due to injury . team captain mark van bommel is definitely out with a suspension due to an accumulation of five yellow cards .
the one bright spot for klinsmann is the likely return of defender philipp lahm , who has been recovering from an illness .
one thing is certain for klinsmann , no matter who ends up on the pitch saturday : bayern has got to play more consistently in the bundesliga .
" this team has shown its quality , " says klinsmann .
" we 've played some great matches in the champion 's league .
the players are really caught up in the champion 's league , but they ca n't lose sight of their duties in the bundesliga .
we 've been coming up a bit short in the bundesliga lately , and you ca n't win when you 're only giving 95 percent . "
a visit ends saturday 's match against hanover marks the final day of american landon donovan 's short stint with bayern .
donovan has been on loan to bayern from the los angeles galaxy , his home club in the mls .
the galaxy has reported that donovan is expected to train with them on tuesday in preparation for their season opener against dc united on march 22 .

" i will tell president obama that he will find a warm welcome , " clinton said at a joint press conference with babacan .
clinton in particular praised turkey for its role in mediating peace talks between israel and syria , saying that the talks were a part of the overall mideast peace process .
" the importance of this tract of the peace process can not be overstated , " clinton said .
return to the negotiating table ?
turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton , left , also met with turkish prime minister erdogan babacan said that once the conditions were right and both sides were ready to again start the talks , turkey would be ready once again to play a mediating role .
clinton also said that two us representatives are currently holding talks in damascus .
asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .
the united states already shares intelligence with turkey concerning pkk separatist rebels based in mountainous northern iraq from where they launch raids on turkey .
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war led to a chill in relations between the us and turkey clinton 's visit to turkey and the announcement of obama 's visit is a part of the new us administration 's attempt to improving ties between the two nato members .
us-turkish relations hit a low point in 2003 after the us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion .
turkish public opinion was overwhelmingly against the war and surveys showed a dramatic fall in the general public 's view of the united states .
" the -lrb- barack -rrb- obama administration has a chance to rebuild on a better footing after the most acute problems accumulated in the bush administration have finally been taken off the table , " said an unnamed senior us official on condition of anonymity .

for juergen klinsmann , saturday 's match against hanover 96 is a big test . one win in five bundesliga matches is not enough to satisfy the high demands of soccer fans in munich , and now that bayern is out of the running for the dfb cup , speculation is rife about the future of juergen klinsmann , who has held the head coaching position at bayern for just eight months .
despite an enthusiastic welcome at the beginning of his post in munich , the tides have quickly turned for klinsmann following a 4-2 loss to bayer leverkusen on wednesday that eliminated bayern from the dfb cup .
klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .
“ we need to stay calm and take care of what 's ahead . ”
a challenge in hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philipp lahm is set to return for bayern this weekend against hanover hanover 96 beat bayern 1-0 in the first half of the season , which does not help bolster confidence in munich for saturday 's match .
despite playing at home , klinsmann must still overcome potential holes in his roster come kick-off .
midfielders franck ribery , tim borowski , and bastian schweinsteiger , as well as striker luca toni , are all doubtful to play on saturday due to injury . team captain mark van bommel is definitely out with a suspension due to an accumulation of five yellow cards .
the one bright spot for klinsmann is the likely return of defender philipp lahm , who has been recovering from an illness .
one thing is certain for klinsmann , no matter who ends up on the pitch saturday : bayern has got to play more consistently in the bundesliga .
" this team has shown its quality , " says klinsmann .
" we 've played some great matches in the champion 's league .
the players are really caught up in the champion 's league , but they ca n't lose sight of their duties in the bundesliga .
we 've been coming up a bit short in the bundesliga lately , and you ca n't win when you 're only giving 95 percent . "
a visit ends saturday 's match against hanover marks the final day of american landon donovan 's short stint with bayern .
donovan has been on loan to bayern from the los angeles galaxy , his home club in the mls .
the galaxy has reported that donovan is expected to train with them on tuesday in preparation for their season opener against dc united on march 22 .

" i will tell president obama that he will find a warm welcome , " clinton said at a joint press conference with babacan .
clinton in particular praised turkey for its role in mediating peace talks between israel and syria , saying that the talks were a part of the overall mideast peace process .
" the importance of this tract of the peace process can not be overstated , " clinton said .
return to the negotiating table ?
turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton , left , also met with turkish prime minister erdogan babacan said that once the conditions were right and both sides were ready to again start the talks , turkey would be ready once again to play a mediating role .
clinton also said that two us representatives are currently holding talks in damascus .
asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .
the united states already shares intelligence with turkey concerning pkk separatist rebels based in mountainous northern iraq from where they launch raids on turkey .

turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion .

the frigate apprehended them when the pirates attacked the german merchant vessel " mv courier " off somalia with anti-tank missiles and firearms . this was the first time in germany 's modern history that its navy had made any apprehensions at sea . according to a report by broadcaster zdf , prosecution officials said there were enough grounds for prosecuting the pirates in germany .
however , the court must first decide whether german interests were at stake during the attack . question of endangered german interests since the " mv courier , " which is owned by a bremen-based shipping company , had been sailing under an antiguan flag with a non-german crew , this could be questionable . also , the german interior ministry earlier this week had said there were no grounds for a german prosecution of the captured men , as no german interests were considered endangered in the attack . for this reason the deal with kenya was crucial , as it has cleared the way for the nine men to be handed over to face prosecution there .
theoretically , the pirates could also apply for asylum in kenya once on land . kjb / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some are a bit too excited about the new us administration , says dw 's christoph hasselbach , but this may be the beginning of something good . such a relaxed atmosphere and so much applause and smiling - hillary clinton 's visit with her nato counterparts and the eu in brussels was like one big party .
europe 's relief over the change in the white house can be tangibly felt in europe .
following the arrogance of the bush years , now it 's time for true cooperation .
it 's as though the entire continent has let out a big sigh and wants to give hillary a big hug .
her visit in brussels and the overall effect of obama 's administration in europe stand in stark contrast to the previous administration , particularly when it comes to tone .
but people are already asking critical questions here : is it all just talk ?
and are the bush and obama governments really that different from one another when it comes down to daily business ?
the real proof remains to be seen , since obama has only been in office for a few weeks .
clinton herself brought a serious note to the air of exuberance .
" we do n't have a choice , we have to come together , " she said , pointing to the worst economic crisis in decades .
just understanding each other is n't enough .
politicians do n't come together to say how much they like each other .
they have an obligation to solve problems .
but it 's an enormous help if the chemistry is already there .
a little too much chemistry ?
however , it 's a little strange that the chemistry here seems to be so right across the board .
the enthusiasm in europe is so ubiquitous that it 's suspicious .
perhaps the most significant - and the most suspicious - is that from the leading british politicians .
suddenly they find everything that obama says great , while they used to find everything that bush said great .
despite some opportunism on the european side , there truly is a stronger connection between the us and europe .
this must be used to combat the crisis .
in a dire situation , both sides not only recognize that they need each other , but also how much they have in common and that they can do more together than they can alone .
looking back on it , this global financial crisis just might prove to be the birth of a new trans-atlantic partnership . author : christoph hasselbach editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for juergen klinsmann , saturday 's match against hanover 96 is a big test . one win in five bundesliga matches is not enough to satisfy the high demands of soccer fans in munich , and now that bayern is out of the running for the dfb cup , speculation is rife about the future of juergen klinsmann , who has held the head coaching position at bayern for just eight months .
despite an enthusiastic welcome at the beginning of his post in munich , the tides have quickly turned for klinsmann following a 4-2 loss to bayer leverkusen on wednesday that eliminated bayern from the dfb cup .
klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .
“ we need to stay calm and take care of what 's ahead . ”
a challenge in hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philipp lahm is set to return for bayern this weekend against hanover hanover 96 beat bayern 1-0 in the first half of the season , which does not help bolster confidence in munich for saturday 's match .
despite playing at home , klinsmann must still overcome potential holes in his roster come kick-off .
midfielders franck ribery , tim borowski , and bastian schweinsteiger , as well as striker luca toni , are all doubtful to play on saturday due to injury . team captain mark van bommel is definitely out with a suspension due to an accumulation of five yellow cards .
the one bright spot for klinsmann is the likely return of defender philipp lahm , who has been recovering from an illness .
one thing is certain for klinsmann , no matter who ends up on the pitch saturday : bayern has got to play more consistently in the bundesliga .
" this team has shown its quality , " says klinsmann .
" we 've played some great matches in the champion 's league .
the players are really caught up in the champion 's league , but they ca n't lose sight of their duties in the bundesliga .
we 've been coming up a bit short in the bundesliga lately , and you ca n't win when you 're only giving 95 percent . "
a visit ends saturday 's match against hanover marks the final day of american landon donovan 's short stint with bayern .
donovan has been on loan to bayern from the los angeles galaxy , his home club in the mls .
the galaxy has reported that donovan is expected to train with them on tuesday in preparation for their season opener against dc united on march 22 .

klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .
“ we need to stay calm and take care of what 's ahead . ”
a challenge in hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philipp lahm is set to return for bayern this weekend against hanover hanover 96 beat bayern 1-0 in the first half of the season , which does not help bolster confidence in munich for saturday 's match .
despite playing at home , klinsmann must still overcome potential holes in his roster come kick-off .
midfielders franck ribery , tim borowski , and bastian schweinsteiger , as well as striker luca toni , are all doubtful to play on saturday due to injury . team captain mark van bommel is definitely out with a suspension due to an accumulation of five yellow cards .
the one bright spot for klinsmann is the likely return of defender philipp lahm , who has been recovering from an illness .
one thing is certain for klinsmann , no matter who ends up on the pitch saturday : bayern has got to play more consistently in the bundesliga .
" this team has shown its quality , " says klinsmann .
" we 've played some great matches in the champion 's league .
the players are really caught up in the champion 's league , but they ca n't lose sight of their duties in the bundesliga .
we 've been coming up a bit short in the bundesliga lately , and you ca n't win when you 're only giving 95 percent . "
a visit ends saturday 's match against hanover marks the final day of american landon donovan 's short stint with bayern .
donovan has been on loan to bayern from the los angeles galaxy , his home club in the mls .

they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .
“ we need to stay calm and take care of what 's ahead . ”
a challenge in hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philipp lahm is set to return for bayern this weekend against hanover hanover 96 beat bayern 1-0 in the first half of the season , which does not help bolster confidence in munich for saturday 's match .
despite playing at home , klinsmann must still overcome potential holes in his roster come kick-off .
midfielders franck ribery , tim borowski , and bastian schweinsteiger , as well as striker luca toni , are all doubtful to play on saturday due to injury . team captain mark van bommel is definitely out with a suspension due to an accumulation of five yellow cards .
the one bright spot for klinsmann is the likely return of defender philipp lahm , who has been recovering from an illness .
one thing is certain for klinsmann , no matter who ends up on the pitch saturday : bayern has got to play more consistently in the bundesliga .
" this team has shown its quality , " says klinsmann .
" we 've played some great matches in the champion 's league .
the players are really caught up in the champion 's league , but they ca n't lose sight of their duties in the bundesliga .
we 've been coming up a bit short in the bundesliga lately , and you ca n't win when you 're only giving 95 percent . "
a visit ends saturday 's match against hanover marks the final day of american landon donovan 's short stint with bayern .
donovan has been on loan to bayern from the los angeles galaxy , his home club in the mls .
the galaxy has reported that donovan is expected to train with them on tuesday in preparation for their season opener against dc united on march 22 .
donovan contributed four goals in five friendly matches for bayern . mz / tt / reuters / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble suggested on friday that opel should consider going into insolvency , saying such a move would not mean that the company would go bankrupt .

" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " the chancellor said in her weekly podcast .
" unfortunately , we have not yet reached this point . "
at talks with german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on friday , opel 's us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- promised to revamp a rescue plan dismissed by the government as inadequate .
" the concept needs to be improved and clarified , " said the chancellor , who promised to do everything in her power to find a solution acceptable to opel 's 25,000 employees .
opel has requested 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state guarantees , but is believed to require a much larger sum if it hopes to stay afloat .
massive layoffs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's chancellor is still not ready to commit to a state aid package for opel according to the german weekly der spiegel to be published on monday , the plan submitted to government officials on friday called for the shutdown of factories at bochum in western germany , eisenach in the east and antwerp in northern belgium .
with 11,000 people losing their jobs , according to this scenario , opel would try to save some $ 1.2 billion -lrb- 949 million euros -rrb- in staff costs , the magazine said .
an alternative proposal would be to cut only 3,500 jobs but lower wages across the board , it added .
another weekly , focus , said opel was asking for four billion euros in state aid , not the 3.3 billion reported earlier , though portions of it could come in the form of guarantees or credits .
focus noted that opel had never paid a single cent in taxes to the german state , as any profits it made were transferred to detroit .
complex structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister guttenberg , left , led inconclusive talks with opel the complex ownership structures between opel and its detroit-based parent company need to be taken into consideration before germany pledges any financial assistance , analysts said .
germany is wary of providing state aid to opel without guarantees that the money will not be siphoned off to the united states .
german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble suggested on friday that opel should consider going into insolvency , saying such a move would not mean that the company would go bankrupt .
on saturday , deputy economics ministry dagmar woehrl said opel could avoid going belly-up only if this quickly provided " an improved outlook . "
she said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " that the government would pump large amounts of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers .
global crisis , local politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many opel employees are fearing for their jobs like many other automobile manufacturers , opel and gm have been hit by a massive fall-off in sales triggered by the global economic downturn .
last week gm posted a $ 30.9-billion loss for 2008 and issued a warning that 2009 would be a challenging year , despite receiving $ 13.4 billion in aid from the us government .
gm has plants operated by subsidiaries belgium , poland , spain and sweden in addition to those in germany and britain .

adolescents at risk with the rise in cases , germany has set a goal together with the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- to eradicate measles , but experts say the current inoculation quota will not achieve this - which is why the first national inoculation conference was held in mainz this week to discuss a vaccination strategy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 07.03.2009 klinsmann 's future questioned after dfb cup elimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann faces increased criticism in munich wednesday 's dfb cup elimination has made bayern fans restless , despite last week 's champions league trouncing of lisbon .
for juergen klinsmann , saturday 's match against hanover 96 is a big test . one win in five bundesliga matches is not enough to satisfy the high demands of soccer fans in munich , and now that bayern is out of the running for the dfb cup , speculation is rife about the future of juergen klinsmann , who has held the head coaching position at bayern for just eight months .
despite an enthusiastic welcome at the beginning of his post in munich , the tides have quickly turned for klinsmann following a 4-2 loss to bayer leverkusen on wednesday that eliminated bayern from the dfb cup .
klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .
“ we need to stay calm and take care of what 's ahead . ”
a challenge in hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philipp lahm is set to return for bayern this weekend against hanover hanover 96 beat bayern 1-0 in the first half of the season , which does not help bolster confidence in munich for saturday 's match .
despite playing at home , klinsmann must still overcome potential holes in his roster come kick-off .
midfielders franck ribery , tim borowski , and bastian schweinsteiger , as well as striker luca toni , are all doubtful to play on saturday due to injury . team captain mark van bommel is definitely out with a suspension due to an accumulation of five yellow cards .
the one bright spot for klinsmann is the likely return of defender philipp lahm , who has been recovering from an illness .
one thing is certain for klinsmann , no matter who ends up on the pitch saturday : bayern has got to play more consistently in the bundesliga .
" this team has shown its quality , " says klinsmann .
" we 've played some great matches in the champion 's league .
the players are really caught up in the champion 's league , but they ca n't lose sight of their duties in the bundesliga .
we 've been coming up a bit short in the bundesliga lately , and you ca n't win when you 're only giving 95 percent . "
a visit ends saturday 's match against hanover marks the final day of american landon donovan 's short stint with bayern .
donovan has been on loan to bayern from the los angeles galaxy , his home club in the mls .
the galaxy has reported that donovan is expected to train with them on tuesday in preparation for their season opener against dc united on march 22 .

some are a bit too excited about the new us administration , says dw 's christoph hasselbach , but this may be the beginning of something good . such a relaxed atmosphere and so much applause and smiling - hillary clinton 's visit with her nato counterparts and the eu in brussels was like one big party .

and are the bush and obama governments really that different from one another when it comes down to daily business ?
the real proof remains to be seen , since obama has only been in office for a few weeks .
clinton herself brought a serious note to the air of exuberance .

" i will tell president obama that he will find a warm welcome , " clinton said at a joint press conference with babacan .
clinton in particular praised turkey for its role in mediating peace talks between israel and syria , saying that the talks were a part of the overall mideast peace process .
" the importance of this tract of the peace process can not be overstated , " clinton said .
return to the negotiating table ?
turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton , left , also met with turkish prime minister erdogan babacan said that once the conditions were right and both sides were ready to again start the talks , turkey would be ready once again to play a mediating role .
clinton also said that two us representatives are currently holding talks in damascus .
asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .
the united states already shares intelligence with turkey concerning pkk separatist rebels based in mountainous northern iraq from where they launch raids on turkey .

us-turkish relations hit a low point in 2003 after the us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion .
turkish public opinion was overwhelmingly against the war and surveys showed a dramatic fall in the general public 's view of the united states .
" the -lrb- barack -rrb- obama administration has a chance to rebuild on a better footing after the most acute problems accumulated in the bush administration have finally been taken off the table , " said an unnamed senior us official on condition of anonymity .

turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton , left , also met with turkish prime minister erdogan babacan said that once the conditions were right and both sides were ready to again start the talks , turkey would be ready once again to play a mediating role .
clinton also said that two us representatives are currently holding talks in damascus .
asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .
the united states already shares intelligence with turkey concerning pkk separatist rebels based in mountainous northern iraq from where they launch raids on turkey .
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war led to a chill in relations between the us and turkey clinton 's visit to turkey and the announcement of obama 's visit is a part of the new us administration 's attempt to improving ties between the two nato members .
us-turkish relations hit a low point in 2003 after the us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion .
turkish public opinion was overwhelmingly against the war and surveys showed a dramatic fall in the general public 's view of the united states .
" the -lrb- barack -rrb- obama administration has a chance to rebuild on a better footing after the most acute problems accumulated in the bush administration have finally been taken off the table , " said an unnamed senior us official on condition of anonymity .
clinton 's visit to ankara followed a stop in geneva where she held talks with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov .
she also spoke to the european parliament in brussels on friday . kjb / tt / dpa / afp / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " the chancellor said in her weekly podcast .
" unfortunately , we have not yet reached this point . "
at talks with german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on friday , opel 's us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- promised to revamp a rescue plan dismissed by the government as inadequate .
" the concept needs to be improved and clarified , " said the chancellor , who promised to do everything in her power to find a solution acceptable to opel 's 25,000 employees .
opel has requested 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state guarantees , but is believed to require a much larger sum if it hopes to stay afloat .
massive layoffs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's chancellor is still not ready to commit to a state aid package for opel according to the german weekly der spiegel to be published on monday , the plan submitted to government officials on friday called for the shutdown of factories at bochum in western germany , eisenach in the east and antwerp in northern belgium .
with 11,000 people losing their jobs , according to this scenario , opel would try to save some $ 1.2 billion -lrb- 949 million euros -rrb- in staff costs , the magazine said .
an alternative proposal would be to cut only 3,500 jobs but lower wages across the board , it added .
another weekly , focus , said opel was asking for four billion euros in state aid , not the 3.3 billion reported earlier , though portions of it could come in the form of guarantees or credits .
focus noted that opel had never paid a single cent in taxes to the german state , as any profits it made were transferred to detroit .
complex structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister guttenberg , left , led inconclusive talks with opel the complex ownership structures between opel and its detroit-based parent company need to be taken into consideration before germany pledges any financial assistance , analysts said .
germany is wary of providing state aid to opel without guarantees that the money will not be siphoned off to the united states .
german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble suggested on friday that opel should consider going into insolvency , saying such a move would not mean that the company would go bankrupt .
on saturday , deputy economics ministry dagmar woehrl said opel could avoid going belly-up only if this quickly provided " an improved outlook . "
she said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " that the government would pump large amounts of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers .
global crisis , local politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many opel employees are fearing for their jobs like many other automobile manufacturers , opel and gm have been hit by a massive fall-off in sales triggered by the global economic downturn .
last week gm posted a $ 30.9-billion loss for 2008 and issued a warning that 2009 would be a challenging year , despite receiving $ 13.4 billion in aid from the us government .
gm has plants operated by subsidiaries belgium , poland , spain and sweden in addition to those in germany and britain .

for juergen klinsmann , saturday 's match against hanover 96 is a big test . one win in five bundesliga matches is not enough to satisfy the high demands of soccer fans in munich , and now that bayern is out of the running for the dfb cup , speculation is rife about the future of juergen klinsmann , who has held the head coaching position at bayern for just eight months .
despite an enthusiastic welcome at the beginning of his post in munich , the tides have quickly turned for klinsmann following a 4-2 loss to bayer leverkusen on wednesday that eliminated bayern from the dfb cup .
klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .
“ we need to stay calm and take care of what 's ahead . ”
a challenge in hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philipp lahm is set to return for bayern this weekend against hanover hanover 96 beat bayern 1-0 in the first half of the season , which does not help bolster confidence in munich for saturday 's match .
despite playing at home , klinsmann must still overcome potential holes in his roster come kick-off .
midfielders franck ribery , tim borowski , and bastian schweinsteiger , as well as striker luca toni , are all doubtful to play on saturday due to injury . team captain mark van bommel is definitely out with a suspension due to an accumulation of five yellow cards .
the one bright spot for klinsmann is the likely return of defender philipp lahm , who has been recovering from an illness .
one thing is certain for klinsmann , no matter who ends up on the pitch saturday : bayern has got to play more consistently in the bundesliga .
" this team has shown its quality , " says klinsmann .
" we 've played some great matches in the champion 's league .
the players are really caught up in the champion 's league , but they ca n't lose sight of their duties in the bundesliga .
we 've been coming up a bit short in the bundesliga lately , and you ca n't win when you 're only giving 95 percent . "
a visit ends saturday 's match against hanover marks the final day of american landon donovan 's short stint with bayern .
donovan has been on loan to bayern from the los angeles galaxy , his home club in the mls .
the galaxy has reported that donovan is expected to train with them on tuesday in preparation for their season opener against dc united on march 22 .

for juergen klinsmann , saturday 's match against hanover 96 is a big test . one win in five bundesliga matches is not enough to satisfy the high demands of soccer fans in munich , and now that bayern is out of the running for the dfb cup , speculation is rife about the future of juergen klinsmann , who has held the head coaching position at bayern for just eight months .
despite an enthusiastic welcome at the beginning of his post in munich , the tides have quickly turned for klinsmann following a 4-2 loss to bayer leverkusen on wednesday that eliminated bayern from the dfb cup .
klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .
“ we need to stay calm and take care of what 's ahead . ”

" we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " the chancellor said in her weekly podcast .
" unfortunately , we have not yet reached this point . "
at talks with german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on friday , opel 's us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- promised to revamp a rescue plan dismissed by the government as inadequate .
" the concept needs to be improved and clarified , " said the chancellor , who promised to do everything in her power to find a solution acceptable to opel 's 25,000 employees .
opel has requested 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state guarantees , but is believed to require a much larger sum if it hopes to stay afloat .
massive layoffs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's chancellor is still not ready to commit to a state aid package for opel according to the german weekly der spiegel to be published on monday , the plan submitted to government officials on friday called for the shutdown of factories at bochum in western germany , eisenach in the east and antwerp in northern belgium .
with 11,000 people losing their jobs , according to this scenario , opel would try to save some $ 1.2 billion -lrb- 949 million euros -rrb- in staff costs , the magazine said .
an alternative proposal would be to cut only 3,500 jobs but lower wages across the board , it added .
another weekly , focus , said opel was asking for four billion euros in state aid , not the 3.3 billion reported earlier , though portions of it could come in the form of guarantees or credits .
focus noted that opel had never paid a single cent in taxes to the german state , as any profits it made were transferred to detroit .
complex structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister guttenberg , left , led inconclusive talks with opel the complex ownership structures between opel and its detroit-based parent company need to be taken into consideration before germany pledges any financial assistance , analysts said .
germany is wary of providing state aid to opel without guarantees that the money will not be siphoned off to the united states .
german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble suggested on friday that opel should consider going into insolvency , saying such a move would not mean that the company would go bankrupt .
on saturday , deputy economics ministry dagmar woehrl said opel could avoid going belly-up only if this quickly provided " an improved outlook . "
she said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " that the government would pump large amounts of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers .
global crisis , local politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many opel employees are fearing for their jobs like many other automobile manufacturers , opel and gm have been hit by a massive fall-off in sales triggered by the global economic downturn .
last week gm posted a $ 30.9-billion loss for 2008 and issued a warning that 2009 would be a challenging year , despite receiving $ 13.4 billion in aid from the us government .
gm has plants operated by subsidiaries belgium , poland , spain and sweden in addition to those in germany and britain .

the who 's european office in copenhagen has warned that measles is a highly contagious disease since many children either have not been immunized or have n't received the necessary stage-two immunization .

some are a bit too excited about the new us administration , says dw 's christoph hasselbach , but this may be the beginning of something good . such a relaxed atmosphere and so much applause and smiling - hillary clinton 's visit with her nato counterparts and the eu in brussels was like one big party .
europe 's relief over the change in the white house can be tangibly felt in europe .
following the arrogance of the bush years , now it 's time for true cooperation .
it 's as though the entire continent has let out a big sigh and wants to give hillary a big hug .
her visit in brussels and the overall effect of obama 's administration in europe stand in stark contrast to the previous administration , particularly when it comes to tone .
but people are already asking critical questions here : is it all just talk ?
and are the bush and obama governments really that different from one another when it comes down to daily business ?
the real proof remains to be seen , since obama has only been in office for a few weeks .
clinton herself brought a serious note to the air of exuberance .
" we do n't have a choice , we have to come together , " she said , pointing to the worst economic crisis in decades .
just understanding each other is n't enough .
politicians do n't come together to say how much they like each other .
they have an obligation to solve problems .
but it 's an enormous help if the chemistry is already there .
a little too much chemistry ?
however , it 's a little strange that the chemistry here seems to be so right across the board .
the enthusiasm in europe is so ubiquitous that it 's suspicious .
perhaps the most significant - and the most suspicious - is that from the leading british politicians .
suddenly they find everything that obama says great , while they used to find everything that bush said great .
despite some opportunism on the european side , there truly is a stronger connection between the us and europe .
this must be used to combat the crisis .
in a dire situation , both sides not only recognize that they need each other , but also how much they have in common and that they can do more together than they can alone .
looking back on it , this global financial crisis just might prove to be the birth of a new trans-atlantic partnership . author : christoph hasselbach editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will tell president obama that he will find a warm welcome , " clinton said at a joint press conference with babacan .
clinton in particular praised turkey for its role in mediating peace talks between israel and syria , saying that the talks were a part of the overall mideast peace process .
" the importance of this tract of the peace process can not be overstated , " clinton said .
return to the negotiating table ?
turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton , left , also met with turkish prime minister erdogan babacan said that once the conditions were right and both sides were ready to again start the talks , turkey would be ready once again to play a mediating role .
clinton also said that two us representatives are currently holding talks in damascus .
asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .
the united states already shares intelligence with turkey concerning pkk separatist rebels based in mountainous northern iraq from where they launch raids on turkey .

" the -lrb- barack -rrb- obama administration has a chance to rebuild on a better footing after the most acute problems accumulated in the bush administration have finally been taken off the table , " said an unnamed senior us official on condition of anonymity .

" i will tell president obama that he will find a warm welcome , " clinton said at a joint press conference with babacan .
clinton in particular praised turkey for its role in mediating peace talks between israel and syria , saying that the talks were a part of the overall mideast peace process .
" the importance of this tract of the peace process can not be overstated , " clinton said .
return to the negotiating table ?
turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton , left , also met with turkish prime minister erdogan babacan said that once the conditions were right and both sides were ready to again start the talks , turkey would be ready once again to play a mediating role .
clinton also said that two us representatives are currently holding talks in damascus .
asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .
the united states already shares intelligence with turkey concerning pkk separatist rebels based in mountainous northern iraq from where they launch raids on turkey .

us-turkish relations hit a low point in 2003 after the us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion .
turkish public opinion was overwhelmingly against the war and surveys showed a dramatic fall in the general public 's view of the united states .
" the -lrb- barack -rrb- obama administration has a chance to rebuild on a better footing after the most acute problems accumulated in the bush administration have finally been taken off the table , " said an unnamed senior us official on condition of anonymity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 07.03.2009 german state aid for opel hangs in balance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like many car makers , opel has been hit by the economic crisis german chancellor angela merkel said conditions were not yet ripe for offering state aid to troubled carmaker opel as the gm subsidiary reportedly threatened to close three plants in europe and sack 11,000 people . " we will provide assistance if the benefits for the people outweigh the losses , " the chancellor said in her weekly podcast .
" unfortunately , we have not yet reached this point . "
at talks with german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on friday , opel 's us parent general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- promised to revamp a rescue plan dismissed by the government as inadequate .
" the concept needs to be improved and clarified , " said the chancellor , who promised to do everything in her power to find a solution acceptable to opel 's 25,000 employees .
opel has requested 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- in state guarantees , but is believed to require a much larger sum if it hopes to stay afloat .
massive layoffs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's chancellor is still not ready to commit to a state aid package for opel according to the german weekly der spiegel to be published on monday , the plan submitted to government officials on friday called for the shutdown of factories at bochum in western germany , eisenach in the east and antwerp in northern belgium .
with 11,000 people losing their jobs , according to this scenario , opel would try to save some $ 1.2 billion -lrb- 949 million euros -rrb- in staff costs , the magazine said .
an alternative proposal would be to cut only 3,500 jobs but lower wages across the board , it added .
another weekly , focus , said opel was asking for four billion euros in state aid , not the 3.3 billion reported earlier , though portions of it could come in the form of guarantees or credits .
focus noted that opel had never paid a single cent in taxes to the german state , as any profits it made were transferred to detroit .
complex structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister guttenberg , left , led inconclusive talks with opel the complex ownership structures between opel and its detroit-based parent company need to be taken into consideration before germany pledges any financial assistance , analysts said .
germany is wary of providing state aid to opel without guarantees that the money will not be siphoned off to the united states .
german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble suggested on friday that opel should consider going into insolvency , saying such a move would not mean that the company would go bankrupt .
on saturday , deputy economics ministry dagmar woehrl said opel could avoid going belly-up only if this quickly provided " an improved outlook . "
she said it was " highly questionable and unlikely " that the government would pump large amounts of taxpayers ' money into a company that plans to close plants and lay off thousands of workers .
global crisis , local politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many opel employees are fearing for their jobs like many other automobile manufacturers , opel and gm have been hit by a massive fall-off in sales triggered by the global economic downturn .
last week gm posted a $ 30.9-billion loss for 2008 and issued a warning that 2009 would be a challenging year , despite receiving $ 13.4 billion in aid from the us government .
gm has plants operated by subsidiaries belgium , poland , spain and sweden in addition to those in germany and britain .
with general elections due on sept .

some are a bit too excited about the new us administration , says dw 's christoph hasselbach , but this may be the beginning of something good . such a relaxed atmosphere and so much applause and smiling - hillary clinton 's visit with her nato counterparts and the eu in brussels was like one big party .
europe 's relief over the change in the white house can be tangibly felt in europe .
following the arrogance of the bush years , now it 's time for true cooperation .
it 's as though the entire continent has let out a big sigh and wants to give hillary a big hug .
her visit in brussels and the overall effect of obama 's administration in europe stand in stark contrast to the previous administration , particularly when it comes to tone .
but people are already asking critical questions here : is it all just talk ?
and are the bush and obama governments really that different from one another when it comes down to daily business ?
the real proof remains to be seen , since obama has only been in office for a few weeks .
clinton herself brought a serious note to the air of exuberance .
" we do n't have a choice , we have to come together , " she said , pointing to the worst economic crisis in decades .
just understanding each other is n't enough .
politicians do n't come together to say how much they like each other .
they have an obligation to solve problems .
but it 's an enormous help if the chemistry is already there .
a little too much chemistry ?
however , it 's a little strange that the chemistry here seems to be so right across the board .
the enthusiasm in europe is so ubiquitous that it 's suspicious .
perhaps the most significant - and the most suspicious - is that from the leading british politicians .
suddenly they find everything that obama says great , while they used to find everything that bush said great .
despite some opportunism on the european side , there truly is a stronger connection between the us and europe .
this must be used to combat the crisis .
in a dire situation , both sides not only recognize that they need each other , but also how much they have in common and that they can do more together than they can alone .
looking back on it , this global financial crisis just might prove to be the birth of a new trans-atlantic partnership . author : christoph hasselbach editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will tell president obama that he will find a warm welcome , " clinton said at a joint press conference with babacan .
clinton in particular praised turkey for its role in mediating peace talks between israel and syria , saying that the talks were a part of the overall mideast peace process .
" the importance of this tract of the peace process can not be overstated , " clinton said .
return to the negotiating table ?
turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton , left , also met with turkish prime minister erdogan babacan said that once the conditions were right and both sides were ready to again start the talks , turkey would be ready once again to play a mediating role .
clinton also said that two us representatives are currently holding talks in damascus .
asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .
the united states already shares intelligence with turkey concerning pkk separatist rebels based in mountainous northern iraq from where they launch raids on turkey .

" i will tell president obama that he will find a warm welcome , " clinton said at a joint press conference with babacan .
clinton in particular praised turkey for its role in mediating peace talks between israel and syria , saying that the talks were a part of the overall mideast peace process .
" the importance of this tract of the peace process can not be overstated , " clinton said .
return to the negotiating table ?
turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton , left , also met with turkish prime minister erdogan babacan said that once the conditions were right and both sides were ready to again start the talks , turkey would be ready once again to play a mediating role .
clinton also said that two us representatives are currently holding talks in damascus .
asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .
the united states already shares intelligence with turkey concerning pkk separatist rebels based in mountainous northern iraq from where they launch raids on turkey .
mending ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war led to a chill in relations between the us and turkey clinton 's visit to turkey and the announcement of obama 's visit is a part of the new us administration 's attempt to improving ties between the two nato members .
us-turkish relations hit a low point in 2003 after the us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion .
turkish public opinion was overwhelmingly against the war and surveys showed a dramatic fall in the general public 's view of the united states .
" the -lrb- barack -rrb- obama administration has a chance to rebuild on a better footing after the most acute problems accumulated in the bush administration have finally been taken off the table , " said an unnamed senior us official on condition of anonymity .
clinton 's visit to ankara followed a stop in geneva where she held talks with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov .
she also spoke to the european parliament in brussels on friday . kjb / tt / dpa / afp / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : clinton 's european visit marks a new beginning europe 's enthusiasm over hillary clinton can practically be cut with a knife .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 07.03.2009 klinsmann 's future questioned after dfb cup elimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann faces increased criticism in munich wednesday 's dfb cup elimination has made bayern fans restless , despite last week 's champions league trouncing of lisbon .
for juergen klinsmann , saturday 's match against hanover 96 is a big test . one win in five bundesliga matches is not enough to satisfy the high demands of soccer fans in munich , and now that bayern is out of the running for the dfb cup , speculation is rife about the future of juergen klinsmann , who has held the head coaching position at bayern for just eight months .
despite an enthusiastic welcome at the beginning of his post in munich , the tides have quickly turned for klinsmann following a 4-2 loss to bayer leverkusen on wednesday that eliminated bayern from the dfb cup .
klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .

for juergen klinsmann , saturday 's match against hanover 96 is a big test . one win in five bundesliga matches is not enough to satisfy the high demands of soccer fans in munich , and now that bayern is out of the running for the dfb cup , speculation is rife about the future of juergen klinsmann , who has held the head coaching position at bayern for just eight months .
despite an enthusiastic welcome at the beginning of his post in munich , the tides have quickly turned for klinsmann following a 4-2 loss to bayer leverkusen on wednesday that eliminated bayern from the dfb cup .
klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .

and are the bush and obama governments really that different from one another when it comes down to daily business ?
the real proof remains to be seen , since obama has only been in office for a few weeks .

suddenly they find everything that obama says great , while they used to find everything that bush said great .

this must be used to combat the crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 07.03.2009 klinsmann 's future questioned after dfb cup elimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann faces increased criticism in munich wednesday 's dfb cup elimination has made bayern fans restless , despite last week 's champions league trouncing of lisbon .
for juergen klinsmann , saturday 's match against hanover 96 is a big test . one win in five bundesliga matches is not enough to satisfy the high demands of soccer fans in munich , and now that bayern is out of the running for the dfb cup , speculation is rife about the future of juergen klinsmann , who has held the head coaching position at bayern for just eight months .
despite an enthusiastic welcome at the beginning of his post in munich , the tides have quickly turned for klinsmann following a 4-2 loss to bayer leverkusen on wednesday that eliminated bayern from the dfb cup .
klinsmann 's team must come up with a win this weekend if he hopes to quiet discussions concerning his job .
hope not lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern be able to repeat the 2008 bundesliga triumph ?
even with bayern 's poor performance in the bundesliga and the dashed hopes of winning the dfb cup , there are still plenty of opportunities for bayern to turn things around .
they are within striking distance of the top spot in the bundesliga from their current fifth place position , and after beating sporting lisbon 5-0 last week in portugal , bayern has virtually locked a spot in the quarterfinal of the champions league .
club manager uli hoeness was eager to draw attention to these possibilities this week .
" i still feel that our present position is not that bad , " he said .
" it makes no sense to start pounding the players .
we must motivate them to meet our bundesliga and champions league goals .
the two biggest aims are still in sight . "
although bayern has won both the dfb cup and the bundesliga title three of the last four seasons and is currently playing well in the champions league , hoeness cautioned against expecting too much .
“ you ca n't be so arrogant to think that a team is going to win all three every year , ” he says .
“ we need to stay calm and take care of what 's ahead . ”
a challenge in hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defender philipp lahm is set to return for bayern this weekend against hanover hanover 96 beat bayern 1-0 in the first half of the season , which does not help bolster confidence in munich for saturday 's match .
despite playing at home , klinsmann must still overcome potential holes in his roster come kick-off .
midfielders franck ribery , tim borowski , and bastian schweinsteiger , as well as striker luca toni , are all doubtful to play on saturday due to injury . team captain mark van bommel is definitely out with a suspension due to an accumulation of five yellow cards .
the one bright spot for klinsmann is the likely return of defender philipp lahm , who has been recovering from an illness .
one thing is certain for klinsmann , no matter who ends up on the pitch saturday : bayern has got to play more consistently in the bundesliga .
" this team has shown its quality , " says klinsmann .
" we 've played some great matches in the champion 's league .
the players are really caught up in the champion 's league , but they ca n't lose sight of their duties in the bundesliga .
we 've been coming up a bit short in the bundesliga lately , and you ca n't win when you 're only giving 95 percent . "
a visit ends saturday 's match against hanover marks the final day of american landon donovan 's short stint with bayern .
donovan has been on loan to bayern from the los angeles galaxy , his home club in the mls .
the galaxy has reported that donovan is expected to train with them on tuesday in preparation for their season opener against dc united on march 22 .
donovan contributed four goals in five friendly matches for bayern . mz / tt / reuters / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and are the bush and obama governments really that different from one another when it comes down to daily business ?
the real proof remains to be seen , since obama has only been in office for a few weeks .
clinton herself brought a serious note to the air of exuberance .
" we do n't have a choice , we have to come together , " she said , pointing to the worst economic crisis in decades .
just understanding each other is n't enough .
politicians do n't come together to say how much they like each other .
they have an obligation to solve problems .
but it 's an enormous help if the chemistry is already there .
a little too much chemistry ?
however , it 's a little strange that the chemistry here seems to be so right across the board .
the enthusiasm in europe is so ubiquitous that it 's suspicious .
perhaps the most significant - and the most suspicious - is that from the leading british politicians .
suddenly they find everything that obama says great , while they used to find everything that bush said great .
despite some opportunism on the european side , there truly is a stronger connection between the us and europe .
this must be used to combat the crisis .
in a dire situation , both sides not only recognize that they need each other , but also how much they have in common and that they can do more together than they can alone .
looking back on it , this global financial crisis just might prove to be the birth of a new trans-atlantic partnership . author : christoph hasselbach editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will tell president obama that he will find a warm welcome , " clinton said at a joint press conference with babacan .
clinton in particular praised turkey for its role in mediating peace talks between israel and syria , saying that the talks were a part of the overall mideast peace process .
" the importance of this tract of the peace process can not be overstated , " clinton said .
return to the negotiating table ?
turkey has hosted four rounds of indirect peace talks between damascus and tel aviv but plans for a fifth round were put on hold when israel launched military operations in the gaza strip at the end of 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton , left , also met with turkish prime minister erdogan babacan said that once the conditions were right and both sides were ready to again start the talks , turkey would be ready once again to play a mediating role .
clinton also said that two us representatives are currently holding talks in damascus .
asked what role turkey might play as the us starts to pull its troops out of neighboring iraq , clinton said it was too early in the planning stages to make any firm announcements .
earlier this week , babacan said turkey would consider allowing us troops to transit through its territory when withdrawing from iraq .
in a joint statement issued later , clinton and babacan expressed commitment to the two-state solution to the israel-palestine conflict and pledged to strengthen cooperation against the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and al-qaeda .
the united states already shares intelligence with turkey concerning pkk separatist rebels based in mountainous northern iraq from where they launch raids on turkey .

the 329 derelict penarth heights flats - known as the billybanks - in penarth , vale of glamorgan , are due to be demolished and replaced by new homes .
but vale of glamorgan council has pulled out of a public inquiry due to be held into orders it issued to evict four residents who remain there .
the council said the current climate gave time for a " considered review " .
the estate is in prime position , on a hill in the seaside town , overlooking cardiff bay , the millennium stadium and out to the bristol channel .
but for years it has been empty and has become a target for vandals , thieves and squatters .
housebuilder crest nicholson has been given permission by vale of glamorgan planners to demolish the 329 council-owned flats and replace them with 377 private houses and flats .
but , while most residents were relocated from the estate years ago , four families have remained on the site .
the council had issued compulsory purchase orders in an attempt to move them , but a public inquiry was called over the issue .
the authority , on the advice of its lawyers , has now withdrawn from the inquiry , which was due to start on 10 march .
it will mean that the start of the project will be delayed .
the council would not give a timeframe for a new public inquiry , which needs to be held before the scheme can continue .
director of environmental and economic regeneration rob quick blamed the current financial climate for the decision .
" the decision to withdraw is to provide time for the council and crest nicholson to have a considered and measured review of this complex urban regeneration project in view of the current market , " he said .
" both crest and the council remain committed to the regeneration of the site , and an announcement will be made in due course on the way forward for the project . "
crest nicholson has said it is still committed to the project , despite the latest development .
but local residents and councillors say the delay - the latest in the last few years - has left them frustrated and worried about the future for the area .
sian morgan isles , 32 , a mother-of-two , who lives opposite the estate , said she and her husband had bought their flat eight years ago believing the billybanks would be demolished .
" we really hoped to make money on the flat and then sell up and have a family , " she said . "
there 's been trouble there , there 's been lots of fires .
we do n't want our children growing up near it " sian morgan isles " as it is we now have two children and still live in a two bed flat .
it 's not nice to live opposite that .
" the view out across the bay is stunning but it would be more stunning and the area more affluent without the eyesore in front of it . "
she said she was also concerned about the people attracted to the empty flats .
" there 's been trouble there , there 's been lots of fires .
we do n't want our children growing up near it .
it 's also very embarrassing when people visit .
" we keep thinking they will be knocked down .
but they 've been saying that for five years .
" it 's such a blot on the landscape and the area would be lovely if it was redeveloped . "
frank pine , of penarth , who often walks his dog lady near the estate , added : " it does look a mess .
they should n't have shut it down in the first place .
they could have spent money on it and made it look nice instead of throwing people out .
" but it 's a cracking spot .
you can see right out across the channel .
you can see why someone wants to redevelop it .
it 's all about the money . "
councillor sophie williams , who represents the estate as part of her st augustine 's ward , said : she was " disappointed " .
" should further negotiations between crest and the vale of glamorgan council conclude that crest withdraw their interest from the project i would call for the possibility of demolition of the site to be considered immediately , " she added .

the 329 derelict penarth heights flats - known as the billybanks - in penarth , vale of glamorgan , are due to be demolished and replaced by new homes .
but vale of glamorgan council has pulled out of a public inquiry due to be held into orders it issued to evict four residents who remain there .
the council said the current climate gave time for a " considered review " .
the estate is in prime position , on a hill in the seaside town , overlooking cardiff bay , the millennium stadium and out to the bristol channel .
the millennium stadium can be seen from the estate but for years it has been empty and has become a target for vandals , thieves and squatters .
housebuilder crest nicholson has been given permission by vale of glamorgan planners to demolish the 329 council-owned flats and replace them with 377 private houses and flats .
but , while most residents were relocated from the estate years ago , four families have remained on the site .
the council had issued compulsory purchase orders in an attempt to move them , but a public inquiry was called over the issue .
the authority , on the advice of its lawyers , has now withdrawn from the inquiry , which was due to start on 10 march .
it will mean that the start of the project will be delayed .
the council would not give a timeframe for a new public inquiry , which needs to be held before the scheme can continue .
director of environmental and economic regeneration rob quick blamed the current financial climate for the decision .
" the decision to withdraw is to provide time for the council and crest nicholson to have a considered and measured review of this complex urban regeneration project in view of the current market , " he said .
the estate overlooks cardiff bay , including the five-star st david 's hotel and the millennium centre " both crest and the council remain committed to the regeneration of the site , and an announcement will be made in due course on the way forward for the project . "
crest nicholson has said it is still committed to the project , despite the latest development .
but local residents and councillors say the delay - the latest in the last few years - has left them frustrated and worried about the future for the area .
sian morgan isles , 32 , a mother-of-two , who lives opposite the estate , said she and her husband had bought their flat eight years ago believing the billybanks would be demolished .
" we really hoped to make money on the flat and then sell up and have a family , " she said .
there 's been trouble there , there 's been lots of fires .
we do n't want our children growing up near it sian morgan isles " as it is we now have two children and still live in a two bed flat .
it 's not nice to live opposite that .
" the view out across the bay is stunning but it would be more stunning and the area more affluent without the eyesore in front of it . "
she said she was also concerned about the people attracted to the empty flats .
" there 's been trouble there , there 's been lots of fires .
we do n't want our children growing up near it .
it 's also very embarrassing when people visit .
" we keep thinking they will be knocked down .
but they 've been saying that for five years .
" it 's such a blot on the landscape and the area would be lovely if it was redeveloped . "
frank pine , of penarth , who often walks his dog lady near the estate , added : " it does look a mess .
they should n't have shut it down in the first place .
they could have spent money on it and made it look nice instead of throwing people out .
" but it 's a cracking spot .
you can see right out across the channel .
you can see why someone wants to redevelop it .
it 's all about the money . "
councillor sophie williams , who represents the estate as part of her st augustine 's ward , said : she was " disappointed " .
" should further negotiations between crest and the vale of glamorgan council conclude that crest withdraw their interest from the project i would call for the possibility of demolition of the site to be considered immediately , " she added .

looking out across the peaceful water , every major cardiff sight is there to behold .
straight ahead is the luxury st david 's hotel and beside it , the impressive wales millennium centre .
to the other side , you can see the landmark millennium stadium , while in the distance are rolling hills and valleys .
but a swift 180 degree turn around from this five-star view transports the admirer into a completely different world .
there 's no ' millionnaire 's row ' of homes here : penarth heights - or the billybanks as it is known locally - is a shell of a housing estate .
it is just so sad .
i miss that there are no kids or families here anymore .
there used to be hundreds of people here , now look at it fay brown surrounded by security fences put up to try to stop troublemakers , hundreds of flats scar the area nested atop the seaside town of penarth in the vale of glamorgan .
the once bustling community of the ' 60s , ' 70s and ' 80s is now a mass of smashed windows and walls either dirtied by deliberately-lit fires or splattered with graffiti .
it really is a ghost town , with its only visitors appearing to be dog owners from the nearby streets , who use the empty greens and abandoned play areas for walks .
for years , the vale of glamorgan council has planned to demolish the flats and redevelop the area .
it has given planning permission for housebuilder crest nicholson to build new homes on the site - homes , which you imagine , will command a far higher price tag than the council-owned billybanks ever did .
but those plans have been delayed after the council pulled out of a public inquiry into the compulsory purchase orders it has issued to the four remaining families on the estate .
for locals , the boarded-up flats are a constant reminder of a community relocated from their homes to make way for the new development .
to see it in this mess is so sad .
i just think of all the council money wasted on it fay brown " it 's such a pity to see it like this , " said fay brown , who lived in a flat in royal close for three years in the 1980s with her husband and three young children .
" i used to come and play up here as a child and it was a lovely little community .
it felt safe and all the kids would play outside with their mothers watching .
" i lived here for three years and loved it .
i lived in number 49 prince charles court and it was lovely at that time .
i was never frightened to be here .
from our bedroom you could see out over the channel .
what a prime site .
" but there were always rumours way back in the ' 80s that they were going to demolish the flats .
that 's why we moved .
" when they finally moved everyone out , it was so sad .
" it ruined the community .
the local school closed , the fruit and veg shop shut and businesses moved to other parts of the town .
there used to even be a community centre and a nursery on the estate . "
the 47-year-old , who now lives near the estate , added : " to see it in this mess is so sad .
i just think of all the council money wasted on it .
" they moved people out and those people did n't want to go .
think of all the rent they could have had over the years .
i ca n't think how long these have been empty .
" they have also had to put security fencing up around the flats because people were going in and ripping things up .
it 's such a pity .
it was a great community there originally ...
you could leave doors open and we were in and out of each other 's houses robert nurse " i do think it needs redevelopment now but i do n't think local people will be able to afford the new homes they put here .
they should have invested in the old flats so that people could have afforded them .
" i miss that there are no kids or families here anymore .

looking out across the peaceful water , every major cardiff sight is there to behold .
straight ahead is the luxury st david 's hotel and beside it , the impressive wales millennium centre .
to the other side , you can see the landmark millennium stadium , while in the distance are rolling hills and valleys .
but a swift 180 degree turn around from this five-star view transports the admirer into a completely different world .
there 's no ' millionnaire 's row ' of homes here : penarth heights - or the billybanks as it is known locally - is a shell of a housing estate .
it is just so sad .
i miss that there are no kids or families here anymore .
there used to be hundreds of people here , now look at it fay brown surrounded by security fences put up to try to stop troublemakers , hundreds of flats scar the area nested atop the seaside town of penarth in the vale of glamorgan .
the once bustling community of the ' 60s , ' 70s and ' 80s is now a mass of smashed windows and walls either dirtied by deliberately-lit fires or splattered with graffiti .
it really is a ghost town , with its only visitors appearing to be dog owners from the nearby streets , who use the empty greens and abandoned play areas for walks .
for years , the vale of glamorgan council has planned to demolish the flats and redevelop the area .
it has given planning permission for housebuilder crest nicholson to build new homes on the site - homes , which you imagine , will command a far higher price tag than the council-owned billybanks ever did .
but those plans have been delayed after the council pulled out of a public inquiry into the compulsory purchase orders it has issued to the four remaining families on the estate .
for locals , the boarded-up flats are a constant reminder of a community relocated from their homes to make way for the new development .
to see it in this mess is so sad .
i just think of all the council money wasted on it fay brown " it 's such a pity to see it like this , " said fay brown , who lived in a flat in royal close for three years in the 1980s with her husband and three young children .
" i used to come and play up here as a child and it was a lovely little community .
it felt safe and all the kids would play outside with their mothers watching .
" i lived here for three years and loved it .
i lived in number 49 prince charles court and it was lovely at that time .
i was never frightened to be here .
from our bedroom you could see out over the channel .
what a prime site .
" but there were always rumours way back in the ' 80s that they were going to demolish the flats .
that 's why we moved .
" when they finally moved everyone out , it was so sad .
" it ruined the community .
the local school closed , the fruit and veg shop shut and businesses moved to other parts of the town .
there used to even be a community centre and a nursery on the estate . "
the 47-year-old , who now lives near the estate , added : " to see it in this mess is so sad .
i just think of all the council money wasted on it .
" they moved people out and those people did n't want to go .
think of all the rent they could have had over the years .
i ca n't think how long these have been empty .
" they have also had to put security fencing up around the flats because people were going in and ripping things up .
it 's such a pity .
