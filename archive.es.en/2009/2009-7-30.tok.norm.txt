program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 30.07.2009 india plans biometric ids for all its 1.16 billion citizens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , india has a patchwork of local ids india is undertaking an ambitious plan to provide identification cards to all its citizens to tackle poverty and fight terrorism .
given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .
it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
" this would be a more computerized card and would not be so easy to forge . " the big guns india has called out the big guns to pull off this huge task , tapping nandan nilekani , the 54-year-old founder and former ceo of india 's biggest computer services company , infosys , to head up the effort .
last year , he published a book , " imagining india : ideas for the new century , " that looks at a range of issues confronting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of infosys , nandan m. nilekani , center , will head up the id project " we have the opportunity to give every indian citizen , for the first time , a unique identity , " he said in an interview with the uk daily the times .
" we can transform the country . " nilekani stepped down from his ceo position at infosys two years ago and it is hoped by many that he can bring some of the skills and efficiency of india 's private sector into a public sector best known for its slow-moving bureaucracy .
former microsoft ceo bill gates has indicated he would like to be involved in the project as it develops . while the project has widespread support in india , worries about possible abuse have been voiced .
some say creating one of the world 's biggest storehouses of personal information will attract identity thieves .
others worry about more controversial uses of the ids , like tracking illegal immigrants . government up to it ? chenoy of nehru university said the " mammoth " task of making accurate ids for more than one billion people could be beyond the government 's ability .
he also wondered if poor people with no documentation could face difficulties proving their identities to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter identity cards are one form of id in india now , but not accepted everywhere " i do n't think is possible without some inconvenience or even distress for poorer parts of the population , " he said . the indian government has said the first id cards should be issued within 18 months .
but analysts have said it could take three , four or more years from the cards to reach a majority of india 's citizens . one world 's rahman said he was encouraged by the example of indian national elections that began in april and lasted for one month and were largely praised as running smoothly , despite the logistical challenges they presented .
still , he also expressed doubts about the government 's ability to manage the project successfully . " i do n't want to be paranoid , " he said .
" but with many government schemes , a very good intention ultimately does n't always get implemented in the right spirit , " he said . author : kyle james editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the carrier 's newly-announced savings program be enough to keep it aloft ? after managing a small profit in the first half of the year , lufthansa chairman and ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced thursday that the airline will cut a billion euros of costs between now and 2011 .
" the figures speak for themselves .
crises ruthlessly reveal the weak points and we shall act , " mayrhuber said in a statement .
the company said it would outline where it planned to make cuts in the coming weeks .
revenues fell over 15 percent from the same period last year to 10.2 billion euros .
profits fell from 677 million euros for the first half of 2008 to eight million in the first half of this year .
" they were within the range of expectations , although i also think the expectations were no longer very high because we 're all aware that the market is bad , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
the airline carried a total of 33.2 million passengers in the first six months of 2009 , a decrease of 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier .
lufthansa 's freight division suffered as well , with a 20 percent drop in first-half traffic to 788,000 tons .
the airline has cut freight capacity by 30 percent .
demand from premium customers collapses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first-class lounges have emptied out as premium customers fly economy class lufthansa , like other airlines , is suffering in particular from the collapse in demand from business and first class travelers who are no longer willing to spend thousands on air travel .
as a result , analyst per-ola hellgren with landesbank baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- lbbw -rrb- estimated that lufthansa has had to cut prices in the forward part of the cabin by up to 30 percent , as compared to five percent in economy class .
" people who were flying premium increasingly say we do n't want to do that , it 's too much money , we need to save , " hellgren said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" lufthansa has to reduce their prices much more in that segment in order to keep the seats reasonably filled . "
there 's very little the company can to do increase revenues in the highly-profitable premium class in the current environment said commerzbank 's skodzik .
" the extent that the premium business recovers depends on how much and how fast the economy improves , " skodzik told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced a billion euro cost cutting plan on thursday middle eastern rivals taking advantage of crisis lufthansa also faces a threat from middle east-based carriers such as emirates , which are able to offer a similarly luxurious experience at lower costs on highly-profitable routes such as new york to shanghai .
" for emirates , their business model is based on the assumption that dubai is a lot cheaper than frankfurt or heathrow , " lbbw 's hellgren said .
" they have a benefit in this market environment , that they can offer a fairly decent premium class arrangement for less money than lufthansa . "
having already made previous rounds of cost-cutting that trimmed administrative expenses , hellgren said the only way lufthansa would be able to achieve the billion euros in cost-cutting that is has pledged will be through cutting capacity , which means grounding aircraft and laying off crews .
while those cost cuts should be enough to see lufthansa through 2011 , the company will be in a difficult position when the economy begins to recover , hellgren said .
" when demand increases again at a later date , they 'll have to increase capacity and those cost savings are simply gone , " said hellgren .

its first webcast of mozart 's " cosi fan tutte " debuts at just a fraction of the live ticket price . the new production of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's 1790 opera " cosi fan tutte , " featuring french soprano patricia petitbon and danish baritone bo skovhus , premieres thursday as part of the month-long salzburg festival , which opened last weekend . opera-goers with tickets to the event have paid up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 522 -rrb- for seats .
webcasters who tune in digitally several hours after the curtain falls pay just 7.90 euros and can access the show for up to two weeks . the salzburg festival follows the example of the equally elite bayreuth festival , which began offering webcasts of selected opera performances last year . with public viewing , however , salzburg took the lead .
it has been broadcasting performances live and free of charge since 2002 , while bayreuth jumped on the bandwagon just last year . drama behind the scenes the salzburg festival gained prestige under the leadership of conductor herbert von karajan in the 1950s .
unlike the bayreuth festival , it offers a wide mix of opera , instrumental concerts and theater . the organization has been plagued by a recent series of personnel changes , with both artistic director juergen flimm and business chief gerbert schaighofer cutting their contracts short to leave in 2011 . flimm , who has been offered a job at the berlin state opera , is to be replaced by the current head of the zurich opera , alexander pereira . kjb / cn / afp / dpa editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" people who were flying premium increasingly say we do n't want to do that , it 's too much money , we need to save , " hellgren said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" lufthansa has to reduce their prices much more in that segment in order to keep the seats reasonably filled . "
there 's very little the company can to do increase revenues in the highly-profitable premium class in the current environment said commerzbank 's skodzik .
" the extent that the premium business recovers depends on how much and how fast the economy improves , " skodzik told deutsche welle .

" they have a benefit in this market environment , that they can offer a fairly decent premium class arrangement for less money than lufthansa . "
having already made previous rounds of cost-cutting that trimmed administrative expenses , hellgren said the only way lufthansa would be able to achieve the billion euros in cost-cutting that is has pledged will be through cutting capacity , which means grounding aircraft and laying off crews .
while those cost cuts should be enough to see lufthansa through 2011 , the company will be in a difficult position when the economy begins to recover , hellgren said .
" when demand increases again at a later date , they 'll have to increase capacity and those cost savings are simply gone , " said hellgren .

the bonn-based commission says the unesco register names the three most important and complete manuscripts of the " song of the nibelungs . "
the documents are kept at the bavarian state library in munich , at badische state library in karlsruhe and at the library at st. gallen monastery in switzerland .
comparable to the greek legend of troy with its 2,400 stanzas , the " song of the nibelungs " is regarded as an impressive example of the european heroic epic .
it was forgotten in the 16th century , only to be re-discovered in 1755 when one of the manuscripts was unearthed in an austrian castle . it became a national epos when richard wagner brought the tale to the stage in operatic form : the ring of the nibelung , better known as the " ring cycle . "
it is the 11th german contribution to the memory of the world collection .
others include grimm 's fairy tales , a gutenberg bible , and beethoven 's 9th symphony .
memory of the world aims at preserving valuable archive holdings and library collections worldwide , and making them available via the internet. db / kna / ap / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 30.07.2009 eu to insist on equal access in us swift data-sharing deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants equal access with the us to swift data the european union will insist on being given equal access to us data on swift bank transfers when the two sides negotiate a permanent deal on information-sharing as a way of fighting terrorism . the eu will " ensure full , perfect reciprocity " in access to european and us swift data files , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot told journalists in brussels .
that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .
every parliamentarian has a constitutional right to ask the government questions and the right to be given open and concrete answers , montag says .
" it is a large part of our parliamentary work and now there can be an end to the vague non-answers of the government . "
renate kuenast , head of the green parliamentary faction , declared that the constitutional court has " put the breaks on de-democratization . " db / dpa / afp / ddp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .
every parliamentarian has a constitutional right to ask the government questions and the right to be given open and concrete answers , montag says .
" it is a large part of our parliamentary work and now there can be an end to the vague non-answers of the government . "

"
movies should n't pretend to be about reality , he told dw . " inglourious basterds " premiered in germany this week and opens in theaters on aug .
20 . deutsche welle : mr. waltz , you received the golden palm at this year 's cannes festival for your role as colonel hans landa in quentin tarantino 's new film " inglorious basterds . "
has this award opened doors for you ? christoph waltz : not immediately , but it 's starting to .
there are some possibilities - we 'll see what becomes of them . what was the production like for you ?
the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .
i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .

you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .

it is the second attack in the country in as many days and has been blamed on eta . the attack occurred near a civil guard barracks in palmanova on the western coast of the island . two civil guard officers , aged in their twenties , were killed after the vehicle that they entered exploded .
the bombers , suspected of belonging to the basque separatist group eta , are believed to have triggered explosives under the vehicle by remote control . later , another bomb attached to a police car was discovered close by .
residents were vacated , and the bomb was destroyed in a controlled explosion . the initial attack prompted authorities briefly to seal air- and sea exits from the island , in a bid to prevent suspects from fleeing .
however , palma de mallorca airport , spain 's third busiest , was re-opened within two hours . the european union condemned the attack as " barbaric " .
a statement released by the eu 's executive also reaffirmed the bloc 's support for spain in its " fight against terrorism . " bildunterschrift : eta 's attacks during the tourist season aim to hurt the government 's coffers violence mounts ahead of eta anniversary thursday 's violence comes on the heels of a similar bombing on wednesday , and one day ahead of the 50th anniversary of eta 's founding , though the group has not claimed responsibility for the attacks . early on wednesday morning , a car-bomb attack on a police barracks in burgos in northern spain injured around 60 people and caused extensive damage to the building and its surrounds . police said there was no telephone warning ahead of the attack , unlike many eta bombings in the past , and this contributed to the high number of casualties . there were around 120 people in the barracks and surrounding buildings , many of them children , when the explosion occurred at 4am . eta often plants bombs in spain during the tourist season as part of its campaign to gain a separate homeland in the basque region , which straddles parts of northern spain and southern france . on friday , the group marks fifty years since the day it secretly formed to fight for basque self-determination under the then repressive regime of general francisco franco . since first resorting to violence in the sixties , the group is accused of killing over 800 people . although polls indicate that most basque 's are in favor of greater separation from spain , support for eta 's violence has waned in recent years . the last fatal attack attributed to eta was in june , when a booby-trapped car killed an anti-terrorist police officer in the basque city of bilbao . peace talks with the government broke down in december 2006 following a car bomb attack in madrid. nw / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .

the bonn-based commission says the unesco register names the three most important and complete manuscripts of the " song of the nibelungs . "
the documents are kept at the bavarian state library in munich , at badische state library in karlsruhe and at the library at st. gallen monastery in switzerland .
comparable to the greek legend of troy with its 2,400 stanzas , the " song of the nibelungs " is regarded as an impressive example of the european heroic epic .
it was forgotten in the 16th century , only to be re-discovered in 1755 when one of the manuscripts was unearthed in an austrian castle . it became a national epos when richard wagner brought the tale to the stage in operatic form : the ring of the nibelung , better known as the " ring cycle . "
it is the 11th german contribution to the memory of the world collection .
others include grimm 's fairy tales , a gutenberg bible , and beethoven 's 9th symphony .
memory of the world aims at preserving valuable archive holdings and library collections worldwide , and making them available via the internet. db / kna / ap / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .
it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
" this would be a more computerized card and would not be so easy to forge . " the big guns india has called out the big guns to pull off this huge task , tapping nandan nilekani , the 54-year-old founder and former ceo of india 's biggest computer services company , infosys , to head up the effort .
last year , he published a book , " imagining india : ideas for the new century , " that looks at a range of issues confronting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of infosys , nandan m. nilekani , center , will head up the id project " we have the opportunity to give every indian citizen , for the first time , a unique identity , " he said in an interview with the uk daily the times .
" we can transform the country . " nilekani stepped down from his ceo position at infosys two years ago and it is hoped by many that he can bring some of the skills and efficiency of india 's private sector into a public sector best known for its slow-moving bureaucracy .
former microsoft ceo bill gates has indicated he would like to be involved in the project as it develops . while the project has widespread support in india , worries about possible abuse have been voiced .
some say creating one of the world 's biggest storehouses of personal information will attract identity thieves .
others worry about more controversial uses of the ids , like tracking illegal immigrants . government up to it ? chenoy of nehru university said the " mammoth " task of making accurate ids for more than one billion people could be beyond the government 's ability .
he also wondered if poor people with no documentation could face difficulties proving their identities to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter identity cards are one form of id in india now , but not accepted everywhere " i do n't think is possible without some inconvenience or even distress for poorer parts of the population , " he said . the indian government has said the first id cards should be issued within 18 months .
but analysts have said it could take three , four or more years from the cards to reach a majority of india 's citizens . one world 's rahman said he was encouraged by the example of indian national elections that began in april and lasted for one month and were largely praised as running smoothly , despite the logistical challenges they presented .
still , he also expressed doubts about the government 's ability to manage the project successfully . " i do n't want to be paranoid , " he said .
" but with many government schemes , a very good intention ultimately does n't always get implemented in the right spirit , " he said . author : kyle james editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 30.07.2009 india plans biometric ids for all its 1.16 billion citizens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , india has a patchwork of local ids india is undertaking an ambitious plan to provide identification cards to all its citizens to tackle poverty and fight terrorism .
given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .
it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
" this would be a more computerized card and would not be so easy to forge . " the big guns india has called out the big guns to pull off this huge task , tapping nandan nilekani , the 54-year-old founder and former ceo of india 's biggest computer services company , infosys , to head up the effort .
last year , he published a book , " imagining india : ideas for the new century , " that looks at a range of issues confronting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of infosys , nandan m. nilekani , center , will head up the id project " we have the opportunity to give every indian citizen , for the first time , a unique identity , " he said in an interview with the uk daily the times .
" we can transform the country . " nilekani stepped down from his ceo position at infosys two years ago and it is hoped by many that he can bring some of the skills and efficiency of india 's private sector into a public sector best known for its slow-moving bureaucracy .
former microsoft ceo bill gates has indicated he would like to be involved in the project as it develops . while the project has widespread support in india , worries about possible abuse have been voiced .
some say creating one of the world 's biggest storehouses of personal information will attract identity thieves .
others worry about more controversial uses of the ids , like tracking illegal immigrants . government up to it ? chenoy of nehru university said the " mammoth " task of making accurate ids for more than one billion people could be beyond the government 's ability .
he also wondered if poor people with no documentation could face difficulties proving their identities to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter identity cards are one form of id in india now , but not accepted everywhere " i do n't think is possible without some inconvenience or even distress for poorer parts of the population , " he said . the indian government has said the first id cards should be issued within 18 months .

many osce commitments were met , but important challenges remain , " added petros efthymiou , the head of the osce observers , before adding that moldova had to work more on democratic reforms in order to win the trust of voters . pro-west parties ready to discuss coalition initial results from the election showed that moldova 's pro-west opposition had unexpectedly defeated the communist party in the tight legislative elections , winning more seats combined than the communists . the pro-west opposition , which is pushing for closer ties with the european union in contrast to the communists who are far more enthusiastic about keeping friendly links to russia , moldova 's former soviet patron , were working to form a coalition after their surprise victory . the three traditionally largest parties of the anti-communist opposition – the liberal democrats , the liberal party and the our moldova coalition – together were set to win 40 seats , the central election commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldovan opposition leader vlad filat has waited a long time vlad filat , head of the liberal democrats , said he believed that opposition leaders could put together a coalition .
" after eight years of authoritarianism , democratic development is possible in this country , " he told reporters .
" democracy and truth have finally been victorious .
we fought for this for so long and with many difficulties . " marian lupu , whose centrist democratic party is a key player in forming a viable government after the election , ruled out any two-party pact with the ruling communist party . " we will not go into a bilateral coalition with the communist party , " said lupu , whose party took fourth place and is likely to win 13 seats .
" i understand that such an alliance will preserve the existing situation in the country – one that is far from good . " i know the mentality of the communists .
it is impossible to form a coalition with them , " said lupu , whose defection from the communist party to the democratic party appears to have contributed much to the transformation of moldova 's political landscape . " our intention is to contribute to a constructive start , a very active start , a balanced start in line with the democratic party style , seeking to form a broad coalition , " he said . serafim urechean , the head of our moldova , told moldovan television that his party was willing to begin coalition negotiations , but only if lupu 's former communist allegiances were truly a thing of the past .
" we are ready to work with the democratic party if it is definitively separated from the communist party , " he said . communist party destined for opposition role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin 's reign comes to an end in defeat for his party the communist party , led by strongman president vladimir voronin , received by far the most votes in wednesday 's polls , but its share of 45.07 percent of the vote was exceeded by the tally of four main opposition parties combined . this gives the communists only 48 seats in the new parliament and its opponents 53 seats , the central election commission said in figures published thursday , based on 98.3 percent of ballots counted . " the communist party will have to join the ranks of the opposition and must not disturb moldova on its path towards european integration , " said dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party . the new parliament must also choose a successor to voronin , who has served out the maximum two four-year terms . despite maintaining that the communists will not be approached to become part of any ruling coalition , the opposition parties will have to call on some communist support if they are to choose the next president , as a three-fifths majority in parliament is required to choose the head of state . wednesday 's election comes less than four months after the last polls in which the communists won about 50 percent of the vote but were accused of fraud , prompting huge numbers of young activists to take to the streets after spreading the word via internet tools like twitter and facebook . the street protests culminated in the sacking and burning of the parliament building in chisinau by young rioters , which russia and voronin 's communists blamed on interference from romania . nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom employees can use the ' hygiene box ' as they enter the canteen preventative measures other companies are also taking preventative measures .
german postal service deutsche post is reportedly considering vaccinations for its employees .
german bank landesbank westlb has told its employees to wash their hands more regularly , and to avoid shaking hands altogether .
other companies have distributed information brochures or set up information hotlines .
when cases of swine flu first broke out , german airline lufthansa began flying company doctors on all flights between mexico and germany – although lufthansa spokesman bernd hoffmann told deutsche welle that this is no longer the case .
mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .
dr. doellinger says many people die each year from regular influenza , and swine flu , in comparison , is quite mild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have not cancelled holiday travel because of swine flu fears " there is a completely incorrect impression in the media , " he says .
however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .
" all the things we should and could be doing anyway , " he says .

some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .

german postal service deutsche post is reportedly considering vaccinations for its employees .
german bank landesbank westlb has told its employees to wash their hands more regularly , and to avoid shaking hands altogether .
other companies have distributed information brochures or set up information hotlines .
when cases of swine flu first broke out , german airline lufthansa began flying company doctors on all flights between mexico and germany – although lufthansa spokesman bernd hoffmann told deutsche welle that this is no longer the case .
mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .
dr. doellinger says many people die each year from regular influenza , and swine flu , in comparison , is quite mild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have not cancelled holiday travel because of swine flu fears " there is a completely incorrect impression in the media , " he says .
however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .
" all the things we should and could be doing anyway , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 30.07.2009 lufthansa manages small profit on global turbulence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling profits and demand at lufthansa means the carrier may have to ground planes germany 's top airline eked out a small win but falling passenger demand is driving down ticket prices .
will the carrier 's newly-announced savings program be enough to keep it aloft ? after managing a small profit in the first half of the year , lufthansa chairman and ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced thursday that the airline will cut a billion euros of costs between now and 2011 .
" the figures speak for themselves .
crises ruthlessly reveal the weak points and we shall act , " mayrhuber said in a statement .
the company said it would outline where it planned to make cuts in the coming weeks .
revenues fell over 15 percent from the same period last year to 10.2 billion euros .
profits fell from 677 million euros for the first half of 2008 to eight million in the first half of this year .
" they were within the range of expectations , although i also think the expectations were no longer very high because we 're all aware that the market is bad , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
the airline carried a total of 33.2 million passengers in the first six months of 2009 , a decrease of 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier .
lufthansa 's freight division suffered as well , with a 20 percent drop in first-half traffic to 788,000 tons .
the airline has cut freight capacity by 30 percent .
demand from premium customers collapses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first-class lounges have emptied out as premium customers fly economy class lufthansa , like other airlines , is suffering in particular from the collapse in demand from business and first class travelers who are no longer willing to spend thousands on air travel .
as a result , analyst per-ola hellgren with landesbank baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- lbbw -rrb- estimated that lufthansa has had to cut prices in the forward part of the cabin by up to 30 percent , as compared to five percent in economy class .
" people who were flying premium increasingly say we do n't want to do that , it 's too much money , we need to save , " hellgren said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" lufthansa has to reduce their prices much more in that segment in order to keep the seats reasonably filled . "
there 's very little the company can to do increase revenues in the highly-profitable premium class in the current environment said commerzbank 's skodzik .
" the extent that the premium business recovers depends on how much and how fast the economy improves , " skodzik told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced a billion euro cost cutting plan on thursday middle eastern rivals taking advantage of crisis lufthansa also faces a threat from middle east-based carriers such as emirates , which are able to offer a similarly luxurious experience at lower costs on highly-profitable routes such as new york to shanghai .
" for emirates , their business model is based on the assumption that dubai is a lot cheaper than frankfurt or heathrow , " lbbw 's hellgren said .
" they have a benefit in this market environment , that they can offer a fairly decent premium class arrangement for less money than lufthansa . "
having already made previous rounds of cost-cutting that trimmed administrative expenses , hellgren said the only way lufthansa would be able to achieve the billion euros in cost-cutting that is has pledged will be through cutting capacity , which means grounding aircraft and laying off crews .
while those cost cuts should be enough to see lufthansa through 2011 , the company will be in a difficult position when the economy begins to recover , hellgren said .
" when demand increases again at a later date , they 'll have to increase capacity and those cost savings are simply gone , " said hellgren .

will the carrier 's newly-announced savings program be enough to keep it aloft ? after managing a small profit in the first half of the year , lufthansa chairman and ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced thursday that the airline will cut a billion euros of costs between now and 2011 .
" the figures speak for themselves .
crises ruthlessly reveal the weak points and we shall act , " mayrhuber said in a statement .
the company said it would outline where it planned to make cuts in the coming weeks .
revenues fell over 15 percent from the same period last year to 10.2 billion euros .
profits fell from 677 million euros for the first half of 2008 to eight million in the first half of this year .
" they were within the range of expectations , although i also think the expectations were no longer very high because we 're all aware that the market is bad , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
the airline carried a total of 33.2 million passengers in the first six months of 2009 , a decrease of 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier .
lufthansa 's freight division suffered as well , with a 20 percent drop in first-half traffic to 788,000 tons .
the airline has cut freight capacity by 30 percent .
demand from premium customers collapses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first-class lounges have emptied out as premium customers fly economy class lufthansa , like other airlines , is suffering in particular from the collapse in demand from business and first class travelers who are no longer willing to spend thousands on air travel .
as a result , analyst per-ola hellgren with landesbank baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- lbbw -rrb- estimated that lufthansa has had to cut prices in the forward part of the cabin by up to 30 percent , as compared to five percent in economy class .
" people who were flying premium increasingly say we do n't want to do that , it 's too much money , we need to save , " hellgren said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" lufthansa has to reduce their prices much more in that segment in order to keep the seats reasonably filled . "
there 's very little the company can to do increase revenues in the highly-profitable premium class in the current environment said commerzbank 's skodzik .
" the extent that the premium business recovers depends on how much and how fast the economy improves , " skodzik told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced a billion euro cost cutting plan on thursday middle eastern rivals taking advantage of crisis lufthansa also faces a threat from middle east-based carriers such as emirates , which are able to offer a similarly luxurious experience at lower costs on highly-profitable routes such as new york to shanghai .
" for emirates , their business model is based on the assumption that dubai is a lot cheaper than frankfurt or heathrow , " lbbw 's hellgren said .
" they have a benefit in this market environment , that they can offer a fairly decent premium class arrangement for less money than lufthansa . "
having already made previous rounds of cost-cutting that trimmed administrative expenses , hellgren said the only way lufthansa would be able to achieve the billion euros in cost-cutting that is has pledged will be through cutting capacity , which means grounding aircraft and laying off crews .
while those cost cuts should be enough to see lufthansa through 2011 , the company will be in a difficult position when the economy begins to recover , hellgren said .
" when demand increases again at a later date , they 'll have to increase capacity and those cost savings are simply gone , " said hellgren .

its first webcast of mozart 's " cosi fan tutte " debuts at just a fraction of the live ticket price . the new production of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's 1790 opera " cosi fan tutte , " featuring french soprano patricia petitbon and danish baritone bo skovhus , premieres thursday as part of the month-long salzburg festival , which opened last weekend . opera-goers with tickets to the event have paid up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 522 -rrb- for seats .
webcasters who tune in digitally several hours after the curtain falls pay just 7.90 euros and can access the show for up to two weeks . the salzburg festival follows the example of the equally elite bayreuth festival , which began offering webcasts of selected opera performances last year . with public viewing , however , salzburg took the lead .
it has been broadcasting performances live and free of charge since 2002 , while bayreuth jumped on the bandwagon just last year . drama behind the scenes the salzburg festival gained prestige under the leadership of conductor herbert von karajan in the 1950s .
unlike the bayreuth festival , it offers a wide mix of opera , instrumental concerts and theater . the organization has been plagued by a recent series of personnel changes , with both artistic director juergen flimm and business chief gerbert schaighofer cutting their contracts short to leave in 2011 . flimm , who has been offered a job at the berlin state opera , is to be replaced by the current head of the zurich opera , alexander pereira . kjb / cn / afp / dpa editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
movies should n't pretend to be about reality , he told dw . " inglourious basterds " premiered in germany this week and opens in theaters on aug .
20 . deutsche welle : mr. waltz , you received the golden palm at this year 's cannes festival for your role as colonel hans landa in quentin tarantino 's new film " inglorious basterds . "
has this award opened doors for you ? christoph waltz : not immediately , but it 's starting to .
there are some possibilities - we 'll see what becomes of them . what was the production like for you ?
the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .
i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .

"
movies should n't pretend to be about reality , he told dw . " inglourious basterds " premiered in germany this week and opens in theaters on aug .
20 . deutsche welle : mr. waltz , you received the golden palm at this year 's cannes festival for your role as colonel hans landa in quentin tarantino 's new film " inglorious basterds . "
has this award opened doors for you ? christoph waltz : not immediately , but it 's starting to .
there are some possibilities - we 'll see what becomes of them . what was the production like for you ?
the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .
i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .
how large is his role in the film that you as an actor were able to have such an influence ? 99.99 percent . bildunterschrift : quentin tarantino on the set of ' inglourious basterds ' in paris in december 2008 interview : marius zekri -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .
every parliamentarian has a constitutional right to ask the government questions and the right to be given open and concrete answers , montag says .
" it is a large part of our parliamentary work and now there can be an end to the vague non-answers of the government . "
renate kuenast , head of the green parliamentary faction , declared that the constitutional court has " put the breaks on de-democratization . " db / dpa / afp / ddp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 30.07.2009 legal setback for german government and its intelligence agencies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin can no longer withhold information without a detailed reason germany 's highest court has ruled against the government for withholding information from a parliamentary enquiry into activities by the german foreign intelligence agency that included spying on members of parliament . the karlsruhe judges said in their ruling published on thursday that the government must give a detailed explanation if it withholds information from parliamentarians .
it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .
every parliamentarian has a constitutional right to ask the government questions and the right to be given open and concrete answers , montag says .
" it is a large part of our parliamentary work and now there can be an end to the vague non-answers of the government . "

that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 30.07.2009 lufthansa manages small profit on global turbulence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling profits and demand at lufthansa means the carrier may have to ground planes germany 's top airline eked out a small win but falling passenger demand is driving down ticket prices .
will the carrier 's newly-announced savings program be enough to keep it aloft ? after managing a small profit in the first half of the year , lufthansa chairman and ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced thursday that the airline will cut a billion euros of costs between now and 2011 .
" the figures speak for themselves .
crises ruthlessly reveal the weak points and we shall act , " mayrhuber said in a statement .
the company said it would outline where it planned to make cuts in the coming weeks .
revenues fell over 15 percent from the same period last year to 10.2 billion euros .
profits fell from 677 million euros for the first half of 2008 to eight million in the first half of this year .
" they were within the range of expectations , although i also think the expectations were no longer very high because we 're all aware that the market is bad , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
the airline carried a total of 33.2 million passengers in the first six months of 2009 , a decrease of 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier .
lufthansa 's freight division suffered as well , with a 20 percent drop in first-half traffic to 788,000 tons .
the airline has cut freight capacity by 30 percent .
demand from premium customers collapses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first-class lounges have emptied out as premium customers fly economy class lufthansa , like other airlines , is suffering in particular from the collapse in demand from business and first class travelers who are no longer willing to spend thousands on air travel .
as a result , analyst per-ola hellgren with landesbank baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- lbbw -rrb- estimated that lufthansa has had to cut prices in the forward part of the cabin by up to 30 percent , as compared to five percent in economy class .
" people who were flying premium increasingly say we do n't want to do that , it 's too much money , we need to save , " hellgren said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" lufthansa has to reduce their prices much more in that segment in order to keep the seats reasonably filled . "
there 's very little the company can to do increase revenues in the highly-profitable premium class in the current environment said commerzbank 's skodzik .
" the extent that the premium business recovers depends on how much and how fast the economy improves , " skodzik told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced a billion euro cost cutting plan on thursday middle eastern rivals taking advantage of crisis lufthansa also faces a threat from middle east-based carriers such as emirates , which are able to offer a similarly luxurious experience at lower costs on highly-profitable routes such as new york to shanghai .
" for emirates , their business model is based on the assumption that dubai is a lot cheaper than frankfurt or heathrow , " lbbw 's hellgren said .
" they have a benefit in this market environment , that they can offer a fairly decent premium class arrangement for less money than lufthansa . "
having already made previous rounds of cost-cutting that trimmed administrative expenses , hellgren said the only way lufthansa would be able to achieve the billion euros in cost-cutting that is has pledged will be through cutting capacity , which means grounding aircraft and laying off crews .
while those cost cuts should be enough to see lufthansa through 2011 , the company will be in a difficult position when the economy begins to recover , hellgren said .
" when demand increases again at a later date , they 'll have to increase capacity and those cost savings are simply gone , " said hellgren .

" the elections in moldova met many international standards , but the process underscored the need for continued democratic reforms to restore public trust , " the osce said in a statement . " i am encouraged by the conduct of these elections .
many osce commitments were met , but important challenges remain , " added petros efthymiou , the head of the osce observers , before adding that moldova had to work more on democratic reforms in order to win the trust of voters . pro-west parties ready to discuss coalition initial results from the election showed that moldova 's pro-west opposition had unexpectedly defeated the communist party in the tight legislative elections , winning more seats combined than the communists . the pro-west opposition , which is pushing for closer ties with the european union in contrast to the communists who are far more enthusiastic about keeping friendly links to russia , moldova 's former soviet patron , were working to form a coalition after their surprise victory . the three traditionally largest parties of the anti-communist opposition – the liberal democrats , the liberal party and the our moldova coalition – together were set to win 40 seats , the central election commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldovan opposition leader vlad filat has waited a long time vlad filat , head of the liberal democrats , said he believed that opposition leaders could put together a coalition .
" after eight years of authoritarianism , democratic development is possible in this country , " he told reporters .

many osce commitments were met , but important challenges remain , " added petros efthymiou , the head of the osce observers , before adding that moldova had to work more on democratic reforms in order to win the trust of voters . pro-west parties ready to discuss coalition initial results from the election showed that moldova 's pro-west opposition had unexpectedly defeated the communist party in the tight legislative elections , winning more seats combined than the communists . the pro-west opposition , which is pushing for closer ties with the european union in contrast to the communists who are far more enthusiastic about keeping friendly links to russia , moldova 's former soviet patron , were working to form a coalition after their surprise victory . the three traditionally largest parties of the anti-communist opposition – the liberal democrats , the liberal party and the our moldova coalition – together were set to win 40 seats , the central election commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldovan opposition leader vlad filat has waited a long time vlad filat , head of the liberal democrats , said he believed that opposition leaders could put together a coalition .
" after eight years of authoritarianism , democratic development is possible in this country , " he told reporters .
" democracy and truth have finally been victorious .
we fought for this for so long and with many difficulties . " marian lupu , whose centrist democratic party is a key player in forming a viable government after the election , ruled out any two-party pact with the ruling communist party . " we will not go into a bilateral coalition with the communist party , " said lupu , whose party took fourth place and is likely to win 13 seats .
" i understand that such an alliance will preserve the existing situation in the country – one that is far from good . " i know the mentality of the communists .
it is impossible to form a coalition with them , " said lupu , whose defection from the communist party to the democratic party appears to have contributed much to the transformation of moldova 's political landscape . " our intention is to contribute to a constructive start , a very active start , a balanced start in line with the democratic party style , seeking to form a broad coalition , " he said . serafim urechean , the head of our moldova , told moldovan television that his party was willing to begin coalition negotiations , but only if lupu 's former communist allegiances were truly a thing of the past .
" we are ready to work with the democratic party if it is definitively separated from the communist party , " he said . communist party destined for opposition role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin 's reign comes to an end in defeat for his party the communist party , led by strongman president vladimir voronin , received by far the most votes in wednesday 's polls , but its share of 45.07 percent of the vote was exceeded by the tally of four main opposition parties combined . this gives the communists only 48 seats in the new parliament and its opponents 53 seats , the central election commission said in figures published thursday , based on 98.3 percent of ballots counted . " the communist party will have to join the ranks of the opposition and must not disturb moldova on its path towards european integration , " said dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party . the new parliament must also choose a successor to voronin , who has served out the maximum two four-year terms . despite maintaining that the communists will not be approached to become part of any ruling coalition , the opposition parties will have to call on some communist support if they are to choose the next president , as a three-fifths majority in parliament is required to choose the head of state . wednesday 's election comes less than four months after the last polls in which the communists won about 50 percent of the vote but were accused of fraud , prompting huge numbers of young activists to take to the streets after spreading the word via internet tools like twitter and facebook . the street protests culminated in the sacking and burning of the parliament building in chisinau by young rioters , which russia and voronin 's communists blamed on interference from romania . nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 30.07.2009 eu to insist on equal access in us swift data-sharing deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants equal access with the us to swift data the european union will insist on being given equal access to us data on swift bank transfers when the two sides negotiate a permanent deal on information-sharing as a way of fighting terrorism . the eu will " ensure full , perfect reciprocity " in access to european and us swift data files , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot told journalists in brussels .
that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom employees can use the ' hygiene box ' as they enter the canteen preventative measures other companies are also taking preventative measures .
german postal service deutsche post is reportedly considering vaccinations for its employees .
german bank landesbank westlb has told its employees to wash their hands more regularly , and to avoid shaking hands altogether .
other companies have distributed information brochures or set up information hotlines .
when cases of swine flu first broke out , german airline lufthansa began flying company doctors on all flights between mexico and germany – although lufthansa spokesman bernd hoffmann told deutsche welle that this is no longer the case .
mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .
dr. doellinger says many people die each year from regular influenza , and swine flu , in comparison , is quite mild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have not cancelled holiday travel because of swine flu fears " there is a completely incorrect impression in the media , " he says .
however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .
every parliamentarian has a constitutional right to ask the government questions and the right to be given open and concrete answers , montag says .
" it is a large part of our parliamentary work and now there can be an end to the vague non-answers of the government . "
renate kuenast , head of the green parliamentary faction , declared that the constitutional court has " put the breaks on de-democratization . " db / dpa / afp / ddp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .
it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
" this would be a more computerized card and would not be so easy to forge . " the big guns india has called out the big guns to pull off this huge task , tapping nandan nilekani , the 54-year-old founder and former ceo of india 's biggest computer services company , infosys , to head up the effort .
last year , he published a book , " imagining india : ideas for the new century , " that looks at a range of issues confronting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of infosys , nandan m. nilekani , center , will head up the id project " we have the opportunity to give every indian citizen , for the first time , a unique identity , " he said in an interview with the uk daily the times .
" we can transform the country . " nilekani stepped down from his ceo position at infosys two years ago and it is hoped by many that he can bring some of the skills and efficiency of india 's private sector into a public sector best known for its slow-moving bureaucracy .
former microsoft ceo bill gates has indicated he would like to be involved in the project as it develops . while the project has widespread support in india , worries about possible abuse have been voiced .
some say creating one of the world 's biggest storehouses of personal information will attract identity thieves .
others worry about more controversial uses of the ids , like tracking illegal immigrants . government up to it ? chenoy of nehru university said the " mammoth " task of making accurate ids for more than one billion people could be beyond the government 's ability .
he also wondered if poor people with no documentation could face difficulties proving their identities to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter identity cards are one form of id in india now , but not accepted everywhere " i do n't think is possible without some inconvenience or even distress for poorer parts of the population , " he said . the indian government has said the first id cards should be issued within 18 months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 30.07.2009 german companies take action to prevent swine flu spread großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is one of the companies taking extra precautions against swine flu many german companies are gearing up for the possibility that swine flu could spread through their extensive work forces .
some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom employees can use the ' hygiene box ' as they enter the canteen preventative measures other companies are also taking preventative measures .
german postal service deutsche post is reportedly considering vaccinations for its employees .
german bank landesbank westlb has told its employees to wash their hands more regularly , and to avoid shaking hands altogether .
other companies have distributed information brochures or set up information hotlines .
when cases of swine flu first broke out , german airline lufthansa began flying company doctors on all flights between mexico and germany – although lufthansa spokesman bernd hoffmann told deutsche welle that this is no longer the case .
mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .

"
movies should n't pretend to be about reality , he told dw . " inglourious basterds " premiered in germany this week and opens in theaters on aug .
20 . deutsche welle : mr. waltz , you received the golden palm at this year 's cannes festival for your role as colonel hans landa in quentin tarantino 's new film " inglorious basterds . "
has this award opened doors for you ? christoph waltz : not immediately , but it 's starting to .
there are some possibilities - we 'll see what becomes of them . what was the production like for you ?
the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .
i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .
how large is his role in the film that you as an actor were able to have such an influence ? 99.99 percent . bildunterschrift : quentin tarantino on the set of ' inglourious basterds ' in paris in december 2008 interview : marius zekri -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .

in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .
how large is his role in the film that you as an actor were able to have such an influence ? 99.99 percent . bildunterschrift : quentin tarantino on the set of ' inglourious basterds ' in paris in december 2008 interview : marius zekri -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the carrier 's newly-announced savings program be enough to keep it aloft ? after managing a small profit in the first half of the year , lufthansa chairman and ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced thursday that the airline will cut a billion euros of costs between now and 2011 .
" the figures speak for themselves .
crises ruthlessly reveal the weak points and we shall act , " mayrhuber said in a statement .
the company said it would outline where it planned to make cuts in the coming weeks .
revenues fell over 15 percent from the same period last year to 10.2 billion euros .
profits fell from 677 million euros for the first half of 2008 to eight million in the first half of this year .
" they were within the range of expectations , although i also think the expectations were no longer very high because we 're all aware that the market is bad , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
the airline carried a total of 33.2 million passengers in the first six months of 2009 , a decrease of 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier .
lufthansa 's freight division suffered as well , with a 20 percent drop in first-half traffic to 788,000 tons .
the airline has cut freight capacity by 30 percent .
demand from premium customers collapses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first-class lounges have emptied out as premium customers fly economy class lufthansa , like other airlines , is suffering in particular from the collapse in demand from business and first class travelers who are no longer willing to spend thousands on air travel .
as a result , analyst per-ola hellgren with landesbank baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- lbbw -rrb- estimated that lufthansa has had to cut prices in the forward part of the cabin by up to 30 percent , as compared to five percent in economy class .
" people who were flying premium increasingly say we do n't want to do that , it 's too much money , we need to save , " hellgren said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" lufthansa has to reduce their prices much more in that segment in order to keep the seats reasonably filled . "
there 's very little the company can to do increase revenues in the highly-profitable premium class in the current environment said commerzbank 's skodzik .
" the extent that the premium business recovers depends on how much and how fast the economy improves , " skodzik told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced a billion euro cost cutting plan on thursday middle eastern rivals taking advantage of crisis lufthansa also faces a threat from middle east-based carriers such as emirates , which are able to offer a similarly luxurious experience at lower costs on highly-profitable routes such as new york to shanghai .
" for emirates , their business model is based on the assumption that dubai is a lot cheaper than frankfurt or heathrow , " lbbw 's hellgren said .
" they have a benefit in this market environment , that they can offer a fairly decent premium class arrangement for less money than lufthansa . "
having already made previous rounds of cost-cutting that trimmed administrative expenses , hellgren said the only way lufthansa would be able to achieve the billion euros in cost-cutting that is has pledged will be through cutting capacity , which means grounding aircraft and laying off crews .
while those cost cuts should be enough to see lufthansa through 2011 , the company will be in a difficult position when the economy begins to recover , hellgren said .
" when demand increases again at a later date , they 'll have to increase capacity and those cost savings are simply gone , " said hellgren .

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .
every parliamentarian has a constitutional right to ask the government questions and the right to be given open and concrete answers , montag says .
" it is a large part of our parliamentary work and now there can be an end to the vague non-answers of the government . "
renate kuenast , head of the green parliamentary faction , declared that the constitutional court has " put the breaks on de-democratization . " db / dpa / afp / ddp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the elections in moldova met many international standards , but the process underscored the need for continued democratic reforms to restore public trust , " the osce said in a statement . " i am encouraged by the conduct of these elections .
many osce commitments were met , but important challenges remain , " added petros efthymiou , the head of the osce observers , before adding that moldova had to work more on democratic reforms in order to win the trust of voters . pro-west parties ready to discuss coalition initial results from the election showed that moldova 's pro-west opposition had unexpectedly defeated the communist party in the tight legislative elections , winning more seats combined than the communists . the pro-west opposition , which is pushing for closer ties with the european union in contrast to the communists who are far more enthusiastic about keeping friendly links to russia , moldova 's former soviet patron , were working to form a coalition after their surprise victory . the three traditionally largest parties of the anti-communist opposition – the liberal democrats , the liberal party and the our moldova coalition – together were set to win 40 seats , the central election commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldovan opposition leader vlad filat has waited a long time vlad filat , head of the liberal democrats , said he believed that opposition leaders could put together a coalition .
" after eight years of authoritarianism , democratic development is possible in this country , " he told reporters .
" democracy and truth have finally been victorious .
we fought for this for so long and with many difficulties . " marian lupu , whose centrist democratic party is a key player in forming a viable government after the election , ruled out any two-party pact with the ruling communist party . " we will not go into a bilateral coalition with the communist party , " said lupu , whose party took fourth place and is likely to win 13 seats .
" i understand that such an alliance will preserve the existing situation in the country – one that is far from good . " i know the mentality of the communists .
it is impossible to form a coalition with them , " said lupu , whose defection from the communist party to the democratic party appears to have contributed much to the transformation of moldova 's political landscape . " our intention is to contribute to a constructive start , a very active start , a balanced start in line with the democratic party style , seeking to form a broad coalition , " he said . serafim urechean , the head of our moldova , told moldovan television that his party was willing to begin coalition negotiations , but only if lupu 's former communist allegiances were truly a thing of the past .
" we are ready to work with the democratic party if it is definitively separated from the communist party , " he said . communist party destined for opposition role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin 's reign comes to an end in defeat for his party the communist party , led by strongman president vladimir voronin , received by far the most votes in wednesday 's polls , but its share of 45.07 percent of the vote was exceeded by the tally of four main opposition parties combined . this gives the communists only 48 seats in the new parliament and its opponents 53 seats , the central election commission said in figures published thursday , based on 98.3 percent of ballots counted . " the communist party will have to join the ranks of the opposition and must not disturb moldova on its path towards european integration , " said dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party . the new parliament must also choose a successor to voronin , who has served out the maximum two four-year terms . despite maintaining that the communists will not be approached to become part of any ruling coalition , the opposition parties will have to call on some communist support if they are to choose the next president , as a three-fifths majority in parliament is required to choose the head of state . wednesday 's election comes less than four months after the last polls in which the communists won about 50 percent of the vote but were accused of fraud , prompting huge numbers of young activists to take to the streets after spreading the word via internet tools like twitter and facebook . the street protests culminated in the sacking and burning of the parliament building in chisinau by young rioters , which russia and voronin 's communists blamed on interference from romania . nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 30.07.2009 german companies take action to prevent swine flu spread großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is one of the companies taking extra precautions against swine flu many german companies are gearing up for the possibility that swine flu could spread through their extensive work forces .
some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom employees can use the ' hygiene box ' as they enter the canteen preventative measures other companies are also taking preventative measures .
german postal service deutsche post is reportedly considering vaccinations for its employees .
german bank landesbank westlb has told its employees to wash their hands more regularly , and to avoid shaking hands altogether .
other companies have distributed information brochures or set up information hotlines .
when cases of swine flu first broke out , german airline lufthansa began flying company doctors on all flights between mexico and germany – although lufthansa spokesman bernd hoffmann told deutsche welle that this is no longer the case .
mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .
dr. doellinger says many people die each year from regular influenza , and swine flu , in comparison , is quite mild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have not cancelled holiday travel because of swine flu fears " there is a completely incorrect impression in the media , " he says .
however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .
" all the things we should and could be doing anyway , " he says .

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .
every parliamentarian has a constitutional right to ask the government questions and the right to be given open and concrete answers , montag says .
" it is a large part of our parliamentary work and now there can be an end to the vague non-answers of the government . "

some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .

mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .
dr. doellinger says many people die each year from regular influenza , and swine flu , in comparison , is quite mild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have not cancelled holiday travel because of swine flu fears " there is a completely incorrect impression in the media , " he says .
however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .

some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom employees can use the ' hygiene box ' as they enter the canteen preventative measures other companies are also taking preventative measures .
german postal service deutsche post is reportedly considering vaccinations for its employees .
german bank landesbank westlb has told its employees to wash their hands more regularly , and to avoid shaking hands altogether .
other companies have distributed information brochures or set up information hotlines .
when cases of swine flu first broke out , german airline lufthansa began flying company doctors on all flights between mexico and germany – although lufthansa spokesman bernd hoffmann told deutsche welle that this is no longer the case .
mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .
dr. doellinger says many people die each year from regular influenza , and swine flu , in comparison , is quite mild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have not cancelled holiday travel because of swine flu fears " there is a completely incorrect impression in the media , " he says .
however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .
" all the things we should and could be doing anyway , " he says .

" the elections in moldova met many international standards , but the process underscored the need for continued democratic reforms to restore public trust , " the osce said in a statement . " i am encouraged by the conduct of these elections .
many osce commitments were met , but important challenges remain , " added petros efthymiou , the head of the osce observers , before adding that moldova had to work more on democratic reforms in order to win the trust of voters . pro-west parties ready to discuss coalition initial results from the election showed that moldova 's pro-west opposition had unexpectedly defeated the communist party in the tight legislative elections , winning more seats combined than the communists . the pro-west opposition , which is pushing for closer ties with the european union in contrast to the communists who are far more enthusiastic about keeping friendly links to russia , moldova 's former soviet patron , were working to form a coalition after their surprise victory . the three traditionally largest parties of the anti-communist opposition – the liberal democrats , the liberal party and the our moldova coalition – together were set to win 40 seats , the central election commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldovan opposition leader vlad filat has waited a long time vlad filat , head of the liberal democrats , said he believed that opposition leaders could put together a coalition .
" after eight years of authoritarianism , democratic development is possible in this country , " he told reporters .
" democracy and truth have finally been victorious .
we fought for this for so long and with many difficulties . " marian lupu , whose centrist democratic party is a key player in forming a viable government after the election , ruled out any two-party pact with the ruling communist party . " we will not go into a bilateral coalition with the communist party , " said lupu , whose party took fourth place and is likely to win 13 seats .
" i understand that such an alliance will preserve the existing situation in the country – one that is far from good . " i know the mentality of the communists .
it is impossible to form a coalition with them , " said lupu , whose defection from the communist party to the democratic party appears to have contributed much to the transformation of moldova 's political landscape . " our intention is to contribute to a constructive start , a very active start , a balanced start in line with the democratic party style , seeking to form a broad coalition , " he said . serafim urechean , the head of our moldova , told moldovan television that his party was willing to begin coalition negotiations , but only if lupu 's former communist allegiances were truly a thing of the past .
" we are ready to work with the democratic party if it is definitively separated from the communist party , " he said . communist party destined for opposition role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin 's reign comes to an end in defeat for his party the communist party , led by strongman president vladimir voronin , received by far the most votes in wednesday 's polls , but its share of 45.07 percent of the vote was exceeded by the tally of four main opposition parties combined . this gives the communists only 48 seats in the new parliament and its opponents 53 seats , the central election commission said in figures published thursday , based on 98.3 percent of ballots counted . " the communist party will have to join the ranks of the opposition and must not disturb moldova on its path towards european integration , " said dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party . the new parliament must also choose a successor to voronin , who has served out the maximum two four-year terms . despite maintaining that the communists will not be approached to become part of any ruling coalition , the opposition parties will have to call on some communist support if they are to choose the next president , as a three-fifths majority in parliament is required to choose the head of state . wednesday 's election comes less than four months after the last polls in which the communists won about 50 percent of the vote but were accused of fraud , prompting huge numbers of young activists to take to the streets after spreading the word via internet tools like twitter and facebook . the street protests culminated in the sacking and burning of the parliament building in chisinau by young rioters , which russia and voronin 's communists blamed on interference from romania . nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .
every parliamentarian has a constitutional right to ask the government questions and the right to be given open and concrete answers , montag says .
" it is a large part of our parliamentary work and now there can be an end to the vague non-answers of the government . "
renate kuenast , head of the green parliamentary faction , declared that the constitutional court has " put the breaks on de-democratization . " db / dpa / afp / ddp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 30.07.2009 eu to insist on equal access in us swift data-sharing deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants equal access with the us to swift data the european union will insist on being given equal access to us data on swift bank transfers when the two sides negotiate a permanent deal on information-sharing as a way of fighting terrorism . the eu will " ensure full , perfect reciprocity " in access to european and us swift data files , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot told journalists in brussels .
that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .

will the carrier 's newly-announced savings program be enough to keep it aloft ? after managing a small profit in the first half of the year , lufthansa chairman and ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced thursday that the airline will cut a billion euros of costs between now and 2011 .
" the figures speak for themselves .
crises ruthlessly reveal the weak points and we shall act , " mayrhuber said in a statement .
the company said it would outline where it planned to make cuts in the coming weeks .
revenues fell over 15 percent from the same period last year to 10.2 billion euros .
profits fell from 677 million euros for the first half of 2008 to eight million in the first half of this year .
" they were within the range of expectations , although i also think the expectations were no longer very high because we 're all aware that the market is bad , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
the airline carried a total of 33.2 million passengers in the first six months of 2009 , a decrease of 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier .
lufthansa 's freight division suffered as well , with a 20 percent drop in first-half traffic to 788,000 tons .
the airline has cut freight capacity by 30 percent .
demand from premium customers collapses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first-class lounges have emptied out as premium customers fly economy class lufthansa , like other airlines , is suffering in particular from the collapse in demand from business and first class travelers who are no longer willing to spend thousands on air travel .
as a result , analyst per-ola hellgren with landesbank baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- lbbw -rrb- estimated that lufthansa has had to cut prices in the forward part of the cabin by up to 30 percent , as compared to five percent in economy class .
" people who were flying premium increasingly say we do n't want to do that , it 's too much money , we need to save , " hellgren said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" lufthansa has to reduce their prices much more in that segment in order to keep the seats reasonably filled . "
there 's very little the company can to do increase revenues in the highly-profitable premium class in the current environment said commerzbank 's skodzik .
" the extent that the premium business recovers depends on how much and how fast the economy improves , " skodzik told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced a billion euro cost cutting plan on thursday middle eastern rivals taking advantage of crisis lufthansa also faces a threat from middle east-based carriers such as emirates , which are able to offer a similarly luxurious experience at lower costs on highly-profitable routes such as new york to shanghai .
" for emirates , their business model is based on the assumption that dubai is a lot cheaper than frankfurt or heathrow , " lbbw 's hellgren said .
" they have a benefit in this market environment , that they can offer a fairly decent premium class arrangement for less money than lufthansa . "
having already made previous rounds of cost-cutting that trimmed administrative expenses , hellgren said the only way lufthansa would be able to achieve the billion euros in cost-cutting that is has pledged will be through cutting capacity , which means grounding aircraft and laying off crews .
while those cost cuts should be enough to see lufthansa through 2011 , the company will be in a difficult position when the economy begins to recover , hellgren said .
" when demand increases again at a later date , they 'll have to increase capacity and those cost savings are simply gone , " said hellgren .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 30.07.2009 german companies take action to prevent swine flu spread großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is one of the companies taking extra precautions against swine flu many german companies are gearing up for the possibility that swine flu could spread through their extensive work forces .
some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom employees can use the ' hygiene box ' as they enter the canteen preventative measures other companies are also taking preventative measures .
german postal service deutsche post is reportedly considering vaccinations for its employees .
german bank landesbank westlb has told its employees to wash their hands more regularly , and to avoid shaking hands altogether .
other companies have distributed information brochures or set up information hotlines .
when cases of swine flu first broke out , german airline lufthansa began flying company doctors on all flights between mexico and germany – although lufthansa spokesman bernd hoffmann told deutsche welle that this is no longer the case .
mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .
dr. doellinger says many people die each year from regular influenza , and swine flu , in comparison , is quite mild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have not cancelled holiday travel because of swine flu fears " there is a completely incorrect impression in the media , " he says .
however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .
" all the things we should and could be doing anyway , " he says .

" the elections in moldova met many international standards , but the process underscored the need for continued democratic reforms to restore public trust , " the osce said in a statement . " i am encouraged by the conduct of these elections .
many osce commitments were met , but important challenges remain , " added petros efthymiou , the head of the osce observers , before adding that moldova had to work more on democratic reforms in order to win the trust of voters . pro-west parties ready to discuss coalition initial results from the election showed that moldova 's pro-west opposition had unexpectedly defeated the communist party in the tight legislative elections , winning more seats combined than the communists . the pro-west opposition , which is pushing for closer ties with the european union in contrast to the communists who are far more enthusiastic about keeping friendly links to russia , moldova 's former soviet patron , were working to form a coalition after their surprise victory . the three traditionally largest parties of the anti-communist opposition – the liberal democrats , the liberal party and the our moldova coalition – together were set to win 40 seats , the central election commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldovan opposition leader vlad filat has waited a long time vlad filat , head of the liberal democrats , said he believed that opposition leaders could put together a coalition .
" after eight years of authoritarianism , democratic development is possible in this country , " he told reporters .
" democracy and truth have finally been victorious .
we fought for this for so long and with many difficulties . " marian lupu , whose centrist democratic party is a key player in forming a viable government after the election , ruled out any two-party pact with the ruling communist party . " we will not go into a bilateral coalition with the communist party , " said lupu , whose party took fourth place and is likely to win 13 seats .
" i understand that such an alliance will preserve the existing situation in the country – one that is far from good . " i know the mentality of the communists .
it is impossible to form a coalition with them , " said lupu , whose defection from the communist party to the democratic party appears to have contributed much to the transformation of moldova 's political landscape .

" the elections in moldova met many international standards , but the process underscored the need for continued democratic reforms to restore public trust , " the osce said in a statement . " i am encouraged by the conduct of these elections .
many osce commitments were met , but important challenges remain , " added petros efthymiou , the head of the osce observers , before adding that moldova had to work more on democratic reforms in order to win the trust of voters . pro-west parties ready to discuss coalition initial results from the election showed that moldova 's pro-west opposition had unexpectedly defeated the communist party in the tight legislative elections , winning more seats combined than the communists . the pro-west opposition , which is pushing for closer ties with the european union in contrast to the communists who are far more enthusiastic about keeping friendly links to russia , moldova 's former soviet patron , were working to form a coalition after their surprise victory . the three traditionally largest parties of the anti-communist opposition – the liberal democrats , the liberal party and the our moldova coalition – together were set to win 40 seats , the central election commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldovan opposition leader vlad filat has waited a long time vlad filat , head of the liberal democrats , said he believed that opposition leaders could put together a coalition .
" after eight years of authoritarianism , democratic development is possible in this country , " he told reporters .
" democracy and truth have finally been victorious .
we fought for this for so long and with many difficulties . " marian lupu , whose centrist democratic party is a key player in forming a viable government after the election , ruled out any two-party pact with the ruling communist party . " we will not go into a bilateral coalition with the communist party , " said lupu , whose party took fourth place and is likely to win 13 seats .
" i understand that such an alliance will preserve the existing situation in the country – one that is far from good . " i know the mentality of the communists .
it is impossible to form a coalition with them , " said lupu , whose defection from the communist party to the democratic party appears to have contributed much to the transformation of moldova 's political landscape . " our intention is to contribute to a constructive start , a very active start , a balanced start in line with the democratic party style , seeking to form a broad coalition , " he said . serafim urechean , the head of our moldova , told moldovan television that his party was willing to begin coalition negotiations , but only if lupu 's former communist allegiances were truly a thing of the past .

will the carrier 's newly-announced savings program be enough to keep it aloft ? after managing a small profit in the first half of the year , lufthansa chairman and ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced thursday that the airline will cut a billion euros of costs between now and 2011 .
" the figures speak for themselves .
crises ruthlessly reveal the weak points and we shall act , " mayrhuber said in a statement .
the company said it would outline where it planned to make cuts in the coming weeks .
revenues fell over 15 percent from the same period last year to 10.2 billion euros .
profits fell from 677 million euros for the first half of 2008 to eight million in the first half of this year .
" they were within the range of expectations , although i also think the expectations were no longer very high because we 're all aware that the market is bad , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
the airline carried a total of 33.2 million passengers in the first six months of 2009 , a decrease of 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier .
lufthansa 's freight division suffered as well , with a 20 percent drop in first-half traffic to 788,000 tons .
the airline has cut freight capacity by 30 percent .
demand from premium customers collapses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first-class lounges have emptied out as premium customers fly economy class lufthansa , like other airlines , is suffering in particular from the collapse in demand from business and first class travelers who are no longer willing to spend thousands on air travel .
as a result , analyst per-ola hellgren with landesbank baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- lbbw -rrb- estimated that lufthansa has had to cut prices in the forward part of the cabin by up to 30 percent , as compared to five percent in economy class .
" people who were flying premium increasingly say we do n't want to do that , it 's too much money , we need to save , " hellgren said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" lufthansa has to reduce their prices much more in that segment in order to keep the seats reasonably filled . "
there 's very little the company can to do increase revenues in the highly-profitable premium class in the current environment said commerzbank 's skodzik .
" the extent that the premium business recovers depends on how much and how fast the economy improves , " skodzik told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced a billion euro cost cutting plan on thursday middle eastern rivals taking advantage of crisis lufthansa also faces a threat from middle east-based carriers such as emirates , which are able to offer a similarly luxurious experience at lower costs on highly-profitable routes such as new york to shanghai .
" for emirates , their business model is based on the assumption that dubai is a lot cheaper than frankfurt or heathrow , " lbbw 's hellgren said .
" they have a benefit in this market environment , that they can offer a fairly decent premium class arrangement for less money than lufthansa . "
having already made previous rounds of cost-cutting that trimmed administrative expenses , hellgren said the only way lufthansa would be able to achieve the billion euros in cost-cutting that is has pledged will be through cutting capacity , which means grounding aircraft and laying off crews .
while those cost cuts should be enough to see lufthansa through 2011 , the company will be in a difficult position when the economy begins to recover , hellgren said .
" when demand increases again at a later date , they 'll have to increase capacity and those cost savings are simply gone , " said hellgren .

its first webcast of mozart 's " cosi fan tutte " debuts at just a fraction of the live ticket price . the new production of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's 1790 opera " cosi fan tutte , " featuring french soprano patricia petitbon and danish baritone bo skovhus , premieres thursday as part of the month-long salzburg festival , which opened last weekend . opera-goers with tickets to the event have paid up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 522 -rrb- for seats .

"
movies should n't pretend to be about reality , he told dw . " inglourious basterds " premiered in germany this week and opens in theaters on aug .
20 . deutsche welle : mr. waltz , you received the golden palm at this year 's cannes festival for your role as colonel hans landa in quentin tarantino 's new film " inglorious basterds . "
has this award opened doors for you ? christoph waltz : not immediately , but it 's starting to .
there are some possibilities - we 'll see what becomes of them . what was the production like for you ?
the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .
i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .

"
movies should n't pretend to be about reality , he told dw . " inglourious basterds " premiered in germany this week and opens in theaters on aug .
20 . deutsche welle : mr. waltz , you received the golden palm at this year 's cannes festival for your role as colonel hans landa in quentin tarantino 's new film " inglorious basterds . "
has this award opened doors for you ? christoph waltz : not immediately , but it 's starting to .
there are some possibilities - we 'll see what becomes of them . what was the production like for you ?
the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .
i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .

given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .
it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .

given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : iraq : the rocky road to democracy and stability power struggles at heart of iraq impasse threaten fragile security experts fear integration of former insurgents threatens iraq 's security iraq 's elections will feature less us presence , but more concerns iraq at a crossroads : a return to chaos or are better times ahead ? iraq -pipe- 30.07.2009 british troops leave uncertain legacy as iraq occupation ends großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with britain 's withdrawal , iraq will have to take care of its own security for the majority of british forces in iraq , their six-year occupation comes to an end on july 31 , a deadline set in an accord signed between london and baghdad in 2008 for the full withdrawal of british troops . the withdrawal of all but approximately four hundred service personnel of the remaining 4000 british troops still on iraqi soil brings to an end a six-year occupation during which – at its height in the months after the 2003 invasion – saw 46,000 troops involved in combat operations , making britain the second-biggest member of the us-led coalition .
britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

its first webcast of mozart 's " cosi fan tutte " debuts at just a fraction of the live ticket price . the new production of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's 1790 opera " cosi fan tutte , " featuring french soprano patricia petitbon and danish baritone bo skovhus , premieres thursday as part of the month-long salzburg festival , which opened last weekend . opera-goers with tickets to the event have paid up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 522 -rrb- for seats .
webcasters who tune in digitally several hours after the curtain falls pay just 7.90 euros and can access the show for up to two weeks . the salzburg festival follows the example of the equally elite bayreuth festival , which began offering webcasts of selected opera performances last year . with public viewing , however , salzburg took the lead .
it has been broadcasting performances live and free of charge since 2002 , while bayreuth jumped on the bandwagon just last year . drama behind the scenes the salzburg festival gained prestige under the leadership of conductor herbert von karajan in the 1950s .
unlike the bayreuth festival , it offers a wide mix of opera , instrumental concerts and theater . the organization has been plagued by a recent series of personnel changes , with both artistic director juergen flimm and business chief gerbert schaighofer cutting their contracts short to leave in 2011 . flimm , who has been offered a job at the berlin state opera , is to be replaced by the current head of the zurich opera , alexander pereira . kjb / cn / afp / dpa editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 30.07.2009 eu to insist on equal access in us swift data-sharing deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants equal access with the us to swift data the european union will insist on being given equal access to us data on swift bank transfers when the two sides negotiate a permanent deal on information-sharing as a way of fighting terrorism . the eu will " ensure full , perfect reciprocity " in access to european and us swift data files , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot told journalists in brussels .
that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 30.07.2009 india plans biometric ids for all its 1.16 billion citizens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , india has a patchwork of local ids india is undertaking an ambitious plan to provide identification cards to all its citizens to tackle poverty and fight terrorism .
given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .
it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
" this would be a more computerized card and would not be so easy to forge . " the big guns india has called out the big guns to pull off this huge task , tapping nandan nilekani , the 54-year-old founder and former ceo of india 's biggest computer services company , infosys , to head up the effort .
last year , he published a book , " imagining india : ideas for the new century , " that looks at a range of issues confronting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of infosys , nandan m. nilekani , center , will head up the id project " we have the opportunity to give every indian citizen , for the first time , a unique identity , " he said in an interview with the uk daily the times .
" we can transform the country . " nilekani stepped down from his ceo position at infosys two years ago and it is hoped by many that he can bring some of the skills and efficiency of india 's private sector into a public sector best known for its slow-moving bureaucracy .
former microsoft ceo bill gates has indicated he would like to be involved in the project as it develops . while the project has widespread support in india , worries about possible abuse have been voiced .
some say creating one of the world 's biggest storehouses of personal information will attract identity thieves .
others worry about more controversial uses of the ids , like tracking illegal immigrants . government up to it ? chenoy of nehru university said the " mammoth " task of making accurate ids for more than one billion people could be beyond the government 's ability .
he also wondered if poor people with no documentation could face difficulties proving their identities to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter identity cards are one form of id in india now , but not accepted everywhere " i do n't think is possible without some inconvenience or even distress for poorer parts of the population , " he said . the indian government has said the first id cards should be issued within 18 months .
but analysts have said it could take three , four or more years from the cards to reach a majority of india 's citizens . one world 's rahman said he was encouraged by the example of indian national elections that began in april and lasted for one month and were largely praised as running smoothly , despite the logistical challenges they presented .
still , he also expressed doubts about the government 's ability to manage the project successfully . " i do n't want to be paranoid , " he said .
" but with many government schemes , a very good intention ultimately does n't always get implemented in the right spirit , " he said . author : kyle james editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .
every parliamentarian has a constitutional right to ask the government questions and the right to be given open and concrete answers , montag says .
" it is a large part of our parliamentary work and now there can be an end to the vague non-answers of the government . "
renate kuenast , head of the green parliamentary faction , declared that the constitutional court has " put the breaks on de-democratization . " db / dpa / afp / ddp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
movies should n't pretend to be about reality , he told dw . " inglourious basterds " premiered in germany this week and opens in theaters on aug .
20 . deutsche welle : mr. waltz , you received the golden palm at this year 's cannes festival for your role as colonel hans landa in quentin tarantino 's new film " inglorious basterds . "
has this award opened doors for you ? christoph waltz : not immediately , but it 's starting to .
there are some possibilities - we 'll see what becomes of them . what was the production like for you ?
the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .
i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .
how large is his role in the film that you as an actor were able to have such an influence ? 99.99 percent . bildunterschrift : quentin tarantino on the set of ' inglourious basterds ' in paris in december 2008 interview : marius zekri -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
movies should n't pretend to be about reality , he told dw . " inglourious basterds " premiered in germany this week and opens in theaters on aug .
20 . deutsche welle : mr. waltz , you received the golden palm at this year 's cannes festival for your role as colonel hans landa in quentin tarantino 's new film " inglorious basterds . "
has this award opened doors for you ? christoph waltz : not immediately , but it 's starting to .
there are some possibilities - we 'll see what becomes of them . what was the production like for you ?
the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .
i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .
how large is his role in the film that you as an actor were able to have such an influence ? 99.99 percent . bildunterschrift : quentin tarantino on the set of ' inglourious basterds ' in paris in december 2008 interview : marius zekri -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the elections in moldova met many international standards , but the process underscored the need for continued democratic reforms to restore public trust , " the osce said in a statement . " i am encouraged by the conduct of these elections .
many osce commitments were met , but important challenges remain , " added petros efthymiou , the head of the osce observers , before adding that moldova had to work more on democratic reforms in order to win the trust of voters . pro-west parties ready to discuss coalition initial results from the election showed that moldova 's pro-west opposition had unexpectedly defeated the communist party in the tight legislative elections , winning more seats combined than the communists . the pro-west opposition , which is pushing for closer ties with the european union in contrast to the communists who are far more enthusiastic about keeping friendly links to russia , moldova 's former soviet patron , were working to form a coalition after their surprise victory . the three traditionally largest parties of the anti-communist opposition – the liberal democrats , the liberal party and the our moldova coalition – together were set to win 40 seats , the central election commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldovan opposition leader vlad filat has waited a long time vlad filat , head of the liberal democrats , said he believed that opposition leaders could put together a coalition .
" after eight years of authoritarianism , democratic development is possible in this country , " he told reporters .
" democracy and truth have finally been victorious .
we fought for this for so long and with many difficulties . " marian lupu , whose centrist democratic party is a key player in forming a viable government after the election , ruled out any two-party pact with the ruling communist party . " we will not go into a bilateral coalition with the communist party , " said lupu , whose party took fourth place and is likely to win 13 seats .
" i understand that such an alliance will preserve the existing situation in the country – one that is far from good . " i know the mentality of the communists .
it is impossible to form a coalition with them , " said lupu , whose defection from the communist party to the democratic party appears to have contributed much to the transformation of moldova 's political landscape . " our intention is to contribute to a constructive start , a very active start , a balanced start in line with the democratic party style , seeking to form a broad coalition , " he said . serafim urechean , the head of our moldova , told moldovan television that his party was willing to begin coalition negotiations , but only if lupu 's former communist allegiances were truly a thing of the past .
" we are ready to work with the democratic party if it is definitively separated from the communist party , " he said . communist party destined for opposition role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin 's reign comes to an end in defeat for his party the communist party , led by strongman president vladimir voronin , received by far the most votes in wednesday 's polls , but its share of 45.07 percent of the vote was exceeded by the tally of four main opposition parties combined . this gives the communists only 48 seats in the new parliament and its opponents 53 seats , the central election commission said in figures published thursday , based on 98.3 percent of ballots counted . " the communist party will have to join the ranks of the opposition and must not disturb moldova on its path towards european integration , " said dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party . the new parliament must also choose a successor to voronin , who has served out the maximum two four-year terms . despite maintaining that the communists will not be approached to become part of any ruling coalition , the opposition parties will have to call on some communist support if they are to choose the next president , as a three-fifths majority in parliament is required to choose the head of state . wednesday 's election comes less than four months after the last polls in which the communists won about 50 percent of the vote but were accused of fraud , prompting huge numbers of young activists to take to the streets after spreading the word via internet tools like twitter and facebook . the street protests culminated in the sacking and burning of the parliament building in chisinau by young rioters , which russia and voronin 's communists blamed on interference from romania . nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its first webcast of mozart 's " cosi fan tutte " debuts at just a fraction of the live ticket price . the new production of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's 1790 opera " cosi fan tutte , " featuring french soprano patricia petitbon and danish baritone bo skovhus , premieres thursday as part of the month-long salzburg festival , which opened last weekend . opera-goers with tickets to the event have paid up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 522 -rrb- for seats .
webcasters who tune in digitally several hours after the curtain falls pay just 7.90 euros and can access the show for up to two weeks . the salzburg festival follows the example of the equally elite bayreuth festival , which began offering webcasts of selected opera performances last year . with public viewing , however , salzburg took the lead .
it has been broadcasting performances live and free of charge since 2002 , while bayreuth jumped on the bandwagon just last year . drama behind the scenes the salzburg festival gained prestige under the leadership of conductor herbert von karajan in the 1950s .
unlike the bayreuth festival , it offers a wide mix of opera , instrumental concerts and theater . the organization has been plagued by a recent series of personnel changes , with both artistic director juergen flimm and business chief gerbert schaighofer cutting their contracts short to leave in 2011 . flimm , who has been offered a job at the berlin state opera , is to be replaced by the current head of the zurich opera , alexander pereira . kjb / cn / afp / dpa editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .

if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .

when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .

i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .
how large is his role in the film that you as an actor were able to have such an influence ? 99.99 percent . bildunterschrift : quentin tarantino on the set of ' inglourious basterds ' in paris in december 2008 interview : marius zekri -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its first webcast of mozart 's " cosi fan tutte " debuts at just a fraction of the live ticket price . the new production of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's 1790 opera " cosi fan tutte , " featuring french soprano patricia petitbon and danish baritone bo skovhus , premieres thursday as part of the month-long salzburg festival , which opened last weekend . opera-goers with tickets to the event have paid up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 522 -rrb- for seats .
webcasters who tune in digitally several hours after the curtain falls pay just 7.90 euros and can access the show for up to two weeks . the salzburg festival follows the example of the equally elite bayreuth festival , which began offering webcasts of selected opera performances last year . with public viewing , however , salzburg took the lead .
it has been broadcasting performances live and free of charge since 2002 , while bayreuth jumped on the bandwagon just last year . drama behind the scenes the salzburg festival gained prestige under the leadership of conductor herbert von karajan in the 1950s .
unlike the bayreuth festival , it offers a wide mix of opera , instrumental concerts and theater . the organization has been plagued by a recent series of personnel changes , with both artistic director juergen flimm and business chief gerbert schaighofer cutting their contracts short to leave in 2011 . flimm , who has been offered a job at the berlin state opera , is to be replaced by the current head of the zurich opera , alexander pereira . kjb / cn / afp / dpa editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the elections in moldova met many international standards , but the process underscored the need for continued democratic reforms to restore public trust , " the osce said in a statement . " i am encouraged by the conduct of these elections .
many osce commitments were met , but important challenges remain , " added petros efthymiou , the head of the osce observers , before adding that moldova had to work more on democratic reforms in order to win the trust of voters . pro-west parties ready to discuss coalition initial results from the election showed that moldova 's pro-west opposition had unexpectedly defeated the communist party in the tight legislative elections , winning more seats combined than the communists . the pro-west opposition , which is pushing for closer ties with the european union in contrast to the communists who are far more enthusiastic about keeping friendly links to russia , moldova 's former soviet patron , were working to form a coalition after their surprise victory . the three traditionally largest parties of the anti-communist opposition – the liberal democrats , the liberal party and the our moldova coalition – together were set to win 40 seats , the central election commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldovan opposition leader vlad filat has waited a long time vlad filat , head of the liberal democrats , said he believed that opposition leaders could put together a coalition .
" after eight years of authoritarianism , democratic development is possible in this country , " he told reporters .

some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .

he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .

webcasters who tune in digitally several hours after the curtain falls pay just 7.90 euros and can access the show for up to two weeks . the salzburg festival follows the example of the equally elite bayreuth festival , which began offering webcasts of selected opera performances last year . with public viewing , however , salzburg took the lead .
it has been broadcasting performances live and free of charge since 2002 , while bayreuth jumped on the bandwagon just last year . drama behind the scenes the salzburg festival gained prestige under the leadership of conductor herbert von karajan in the 1950s .
unlike the bayreuth festival , it offers a wide mix of opera , instrumental concerts and theater . the organization has been plagued by a recent series of personnel changes , with both artistic director juergen flimm and business chief gerbert schaighofer cutting their contracts short to leave in 2011 . flimm , who has been offered a job at the berlin state opera , is to be replaced by the current head of the zurich opera , alexander pereira . kjb / cn / afp / dpa editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the carrier 's newly-announced savings program be enough to keep it aloft ? after managing a small profit in the first half of the year , lufthansa chairman and ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced thursday that the airline will cut a billion euros of costs between now and 2011 .
" the figures speak for themselves .
crises ruthlessly reveal the weak points and we shall act , " mayrhuber said in a statement .
the company said it would outline where it planned to make cuts in the coming weeks .
revenues fell over 15 percent from the same period last year to 10.2 billion euros .
profits fell from 677 million euros for the first half of 2008 to eight million in the first half of this year .
" they were within the range of expectations , although i also think the expectations were no longer very high because we 're all aware that the market is bad , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
the airline carried a total of 33.2 million passengers in the first six months of 2009 , a decrease of 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier .
lufthansa 's freight division suffered as well , with a 20 percent drop in first-half traffic to 788,000 tons .
the airline has cut freight capacity by 30 percent .
demand from premium customers collapses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first-class lounges have emptied out as premium customers fly economy class lufthansa , like other airlines , is suffering in particular from the collapse in demand from business and first class travelers who are no longer willing to spend thousands on air travel .
as a result , analyst per-ola hellgren with landesbank baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- lbbw -rrb- estimated that lufthansa has had to cut prices in the forward part of the cabin by up to 30 percent , as compared to five percent in economy class .
" people who were flying premium increasingly say we do n't want to do that , it 's too much money , we need to save , " hellgren said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" lufthansa has to reduce their prices much more in that segment in order to keep the seats reasonably filled . "
there 's very little the company can to do increase revenues in the highly-profitable premium class in the current environment said commerzbank 's skodzik .
" the extent that the premium business recovers depends on how much and how fast the economy improves , " skodzik told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced a billion euro cost cutting plan on thursday middle eastern rivals taking advantage of crisis lufthansa also faces a threat from middle east-based carriers such as emirates , which are able to offer a similarly luxurious experience at lower costs on highly-profitable routes such as new york to shanghai .
" for emirates , their business model is based on the assumption that dubai is a lot cheaper than frankfurt or heathrow , " lbbw 's hellgren said .
" they have a benefit in this market environment , that they can offer a fairly decent premium class arrangement for less money than lufthansa . "
having already made previous rounds of cost-cutting that trimmed administrative expenses , hellgren said the only way lufthansa would be able to achieve the billion euros in cost-cutting that is has pledged will be through cutting capacity , which means grounding aircraft and laying off crews .
while those cost cuts should be enough to see lufthansa through 2011 , the company will be in a difficult position when the economy begins to recover , hellgren said .
" when demand increases again at a later date , they 'll have to increase capacity and those cost savings are simply gone , " said hellgren .

lufthansa 's freight division suffered as well , with a 20 percent drop in first-half traffic to 788,000 tons .
the airline has cut freight capacity by 30 percent .
demand from premium customers collapses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first-class lounges have emptied out as premium customers fly economy class lufthansa , like other airlines , is suffering in particular from the collapse in demand from business and first class travelers who are no longer willing to spend thousands on air travel .
as a result , analyst per-ola hellgren with landesbank baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- lbbw -rrb- estimated that lufthansa has had to cut prices in the forward part of the cabin by up to 30 percent , as compared to five percent in economy class .
" people who were flying premium increasingly say we do n't want to do that , it 's too much money , we need to save , " hellgren said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" lufthansa has to reduce their prices much more in that segment in order to keep the seats reasonably filled . "
there 's very little the company can to do increase revenues in the highly-profitable premium class in the current environment said commerzbank 's skodzik .
" the extent that the premium business recovers depends on how much and how fast the economy improves , " skodzik told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced a billion euro cost cutting plan on thursday middle eastern rivals taking advantage of crisis lufthansa also faces a threat from middle east-based carriers such as emirates , which are able to offer a similarly luxurious experience at lower costs on highly-profitable routes such as new york to shanghai .
" for emirates , their business model is based on the assumption that dubai is a lot cheaper than frankfurt or heathrow , " lbbw 's hellgren said .
" they have a benefit in this market environment , that they can offer a fairly decent premium class arrangement for less money than lufthansa . "
having already made previous rounds of cost-cutting that trimmed administrative expenses , hellgren said the only way lufthansa would be able to achieve the billion euros in cost-cutting that is has pledged will be through cutting capacity , which means grounding aircraft and laying off crews .
while those cost cuts should be enough to see lufthansa through 2011 , the company will be in a difficult position when the economy begins to recover , hellgren said .
" when demand increases again at a later date , they 'll have to increase capacity and those cost savings are simply gone , " said hellgren .

its first webcast of mozart 's " cosi fan tutte " debuts at just a fraction of the live ticket price . the new production of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's 1790 opera " cosi fan tutte , " featuring french soprano patricia petitbon and danish baritone bo skovhus , premieres thursday as part of the month-long salzburg festival , which opened last weekend . opera-goers with tickets to the event have paid up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 522 -rrb- for seats .
webcasters who tune in digitally several hours after the curtain falls pay just 7.90 euros and can access the show for up to two weeks . the salzburg festival follows the example of the equally elite bayreuth festival , which began offering webcasts of selected opera performances last year . with public viewing , however , salzburg took the lead .
it has been broadcasting performances live and free of charge since 2002 , while bayreuth jumped on the bandwagon just last year . drama behind the scenes the salzburg festival gained prestige under the leadership of conductor herbert von karajan in the 1950s .
unlike the bayreuth festival , it offers a wide mix of opera , instrumental concerts and theater . the organization has been plagued by a recent series of personnel changes , with both artistic director juergen flimm and business chief gerbert schaighofer cutting their contracts short to leave in 2011 . flimm , who has been offered a job at the berlin state opera , is to be replaced by the current head of the zurich opera , alexander pereira . kjb / cn / afp / dpa editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the carrier 's newly-announced savings program be enough to keep it aloft ? after managing a small profit in the first half of the year , lufthansa chairman and ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced thursday that the airline will cut a billion euros of costs between now and 2011 .
" the figures speak for themselves .
crises ruthlessly reveal the weak points and we shall act , " mayrhuber said in a statement .
the company said it would outline where it planned to make cuts in the coming weeks .
revenues fell over 15 percent from the same period last year to 10.2 billion euros .
profits fell from 677 million euros for the first half of 2008 to eight million in the first half of this year .
" they were within the range of expectations , although i also think the expectations were no longer very high because we 're all aware that the market is bad , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
the airline carried a total of 33.2 million passengers in the first six months of 2009 , a decrease of 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier .
lufthansa 's freight division suffered as well , with a 20 percent drop in first-half traffic to 788,000 tons .
the airline has cut freight capacity by 30 percent .
demand from premium customers collapses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first-class lounges have emptied out as premium customers fly economy class lufthansa , like other airlines , is suffering in particular from the collapse in demand from business and first class travelers who are no longer willing to spend thousands on air travel .
as a result , analyst per-ola hellgren with landesbank baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- lbbw -rrb- estimated that lufthansa has had to cut prices in the forward part of the cabin by up to 30 percent , as compared to five percent in economy class .
" people who were flying premium increasingly say we do n't want to do that , it 's too much money , we need to save , " hellgren said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" lufthansa has to reduce their prices much more in that segment in order to keep the seats reasonably filled . "
there 's very little the company can to do increase revenues in the highly-profitable premium class in the current environment said commerzbank 's skodzik .
" the extent that the premium business recovers depends on how much and how fast the economy improves , " skodzik told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced a billion euro cost cutting plan on thursday middle eastern rivals taking advantage of crisis lufthansa also faces a threat from middle east-based carriers such as emirates , which are able to offer a similarly luxurious experience at lower costs on highly-profitable routes such as new york to shanghai .
" for emirates , their business model is based on the assumption that dubai is a lot cheaper than frankfurt or heathrow , " lbbw 's hellgren said .
" they have a benefit in this market environment , that they can offer a fairly decent premium class arrangement for less money than lufthansa . "
having already made previous rounds of cost-cutting that trimmed administrative expenses , hellgren said the only way lufthansa would be able to achieve the billion euros in cost-cutting that is has pledged will be through cutting capacity , which means grounding aircraft and laying off crews .
while those cost cuts should be enough to see lufthansa through 2011 , the company will be in a difficult position when the economy begins to recover , hellgren said .
" when demand increases again at a later date , they 'll have to increase capacity and those cost savings are simply gone , " said hellgren .

"
movies should n't pretend to be about reality , he told dw . " inglourious basterds " premiered in germany this week and opens in theaters on aug .
20 . deutsche welle : mr. waltz , you received the golden palm at this year 's cannes festival for your role as colonel hans landa in quentin tarantino 's new film " inglorious basterds . "
has this award opened doors for you ? christoph waltz : not immediately , but it 's starting to .
there are some possibilities - we 'll see what becomes of them . what was the production like for you ?
the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .
i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .

when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 30.07.2009 german companies take action to prevent swine flu spread großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is one of the companies taking extra precautions against swine flu many german companies are gearing up for the possibility that swine flu could spread through their extensive work forces .
some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom employees can use the ' hygiene box ' as they enter the canteen preventative measures other companies are also taking preventative measures .
german postal service deutsche post is reportedly considering vaccinations for its employees .
german bank landesbank westlb has told its employees to wash their hands more regularly , and to avoid shaking hands altogether .
other companies have distributed information brochures or set up information hotlines .
when cases of swine flu first broke out , german airline lufthansa began flying company doctors on all flights between mexico and germany – although lufthansa spokesman bernd hoffmann told deutsche welle that this is no longer the case .
mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .
dr. doellinger says many people die each year from regular influenza , and swine flu , in comparison , is quite mild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have not cancelled holiday travel because of swine flu fears " there is a completely incorrect impression in the media , " he says .
however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .
" all the things we should and could be doing anyway , " he says .

given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .
it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
" this would be a more computerized card and would not be so easy to forge . " the big guns india has called out the big guns to pull off this huge task , tapping nandan nilekani , the 54-year-old founder and former ceo of india 's biggest computer services company , infosys , to head up the effort .

" we can transform the country . " nilekani stepped down from his ceo position at infosys two years ago and it is hoped by many that he can bring some of the skills and efficiency of india 's private sector into a public sector best known for its slow-moving bureaucracy .
former microsoft ceo bill gates has indicated he would like to be involved in the project as it develops . while the project has widespread support in india , worries about possible abuse have been voiced .
some say creating one of the world 's biggest storehouses of personal information will attract identity thieves .
others worry about more controversial uses of the ids , like tracking illegal immigrants . government up to it ? chenoy of nehru university said the " mammoth " task of making accurate ids for more than one billion people could be beyond the government 's ability .

" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
" this would be a more computerized card and would not be so easy to forge . " the big guns india has called out the big guns to pull off this huge task , tapping nandan nilekani , the 54-year-old founder and former ceo of india 's biggest computer services company , infosys , to head up the effort .
last year , he published a book , " imagining india : ideas for the new century , " that looks at a range of issues confronting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of infosys , nandan m. nilekani , center , will head up the id project " we have the opportunity to give every indian citizen , for the first time , a unique identity , " he said in an interview with the uk daily the times .
" we can transform the country . " nilekani stepped down from his ceo position at infosys two years ago and it is hoped by many that he can bring some of the skills and efficiency of india 's private sector into a public sector best known for its slow-moving bureaucracy .
former microsoft ceo bill gates has indicated he would like to be involved in the project as it develops . while the project has widespread support in india , worries about possible abuse have been voiced .
some say creating one of the world 's biggest storehouses of personal information will attract identity thieves .
others worry about more controversial uses of the ids , like tracking illegal immigrants . government up to it ? chenoy of nehru university said the " mammoth " task of making accurate ids for more than one billion people could be beyond the government 's ability .
he also wondered if poor people with no documentation could face difficulties proving their identities to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter identity cards are one form of id in india now , but not accepted everywhere " i do n't think is possible without some inconvenience or even distress for poorer parts of the population , " he said . the indian government has said the first id cards should be issued within 18 months .
but analysts have said it could take three , four or more years from the cards to reach a majority of india 's citizens . one world 's rahman said he was encouraged by the example of indian national elections that began in april and lasted for one month and were largely praised as running smoothly , despite the logistical challenges they presented .
still , he also expressed doubts about the government 's ability to manage the project successfully . " i do n't want to be paranoid , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 30.07.2009 lufthansa manages small profit on global turbulence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling profits and demand at lufthansa means the carrier may have to ground planes germany 's top airline eked out a small win but falling passenger demand is driving down ticket prices .
will the carrier 's newly-announced savings program be enough to keep it aloft ? after managing a small profit in the first half of the year , lufthansa chairman and ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced thursday that the airline will cut a billion euros of costs between now and 2011 .
" the figures speak for themselves .
crises ruthlessly reveal the weak points and we shall act , " mayrhuber said in a statement .
the company said it would outline where it planned to make cuts in the coming weeks .
revenues fell over 15 percent from the same period last year to 10.2 billion euros .
profits fell from 677 million euros for the first half of 2008 to eight million in the first half of this year .
" they were within the range of expectations , although i also think the expectations were no longer very high because we 're all aware that the market is bad , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
the airline carried a total of 33.2 million passengers in the first six months of 2009 , a decrease of 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier .
lufthansa 's freight division suffered as well , with a 20 percent drop in first-half traffic to 788,000 tons .
the airline has cut freight capacity by 30 percent .
demand from premium customers collapses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first-class lounges have emptied out as premium customers fly economy class lufthansa , like other airlines , is suffering in particular from the collapse in demand from business and first class travelers who are no longer willing to spend thousands on air travel .
as a result , analyst per-ola hellgren with landesbank baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- lbbw -rrb- estimated that lufthansa has had to cut prices in the forward part of the cabin by up to 30 percent , as compared to five percent in economy class .
" people who were flying premium increasingly say we do n't want to do that , it 's too much money , we need to save , " hellgren said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" lufthansa has to reduce their prices much more in that segment in order to keep the seats reasonably filled . "
there 's very little the company can to do increase revenues in the highly-profitable premium class in the current environment said commerzbank 's skodzik .
" the extent that the premium business recovers depends on how much and how fast the economy improves , " skodzik told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced a billion euro cost cutting plan on thursday middle eastern rivals taking advantage of crisis lufthansa also faces a threat from middle east-based carriers such as emirates , which are able to offer a similarly luxurious experience at lower costs on highly-profitable routes such as new york to shanghai .
" for emirates , their business model is based on the assumption that dubai is a lot cheaper than frankfurt or heathrow , " lbbw 's hellgren said .
" they have a benefit in this market environment , that they can offer a fairly decent premium class arrangement for less money than lufthansa . "
having already made previous rounds of cost-cutting that trimmed administrative expenses , hellgren said the only way lufthansa would be able to achieve the billion euros in cost-cutting that is has pledged will be through cutting capacity , which means grounding aircraft and laying off crews .
while those cost cuts should be enough to see lufthansa through 2011 , the company will be in a difficult position when the economy begins to recover , hellgren said .
" when demand increases again at a later date , they 'll have to increase capacity and those cost savings are simply gone , " said hellgren .

"
movies should n't pretend to be about reality , he told dw . " inglourious basterds " premiered in germany this week and opens in theaters on aug .
20 . deutsche welle : mr. waltz , you received the golden palm at this year 's cannes festival for your role as colonel hans landa in quentin tarantino 's new film " inglorious basterds . "
has this award opened doors for you ? christoph waltz : not immediately , but it 's starting to .
there are some possibilities - we 'll see what becomes of them . what was the production like for you ?
the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .
i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .
how large is his role in the film that you as an actor were able to have such an influence ? 99.99 percent . bildunterschrift : quentin tarantino on the set of ' inglourious basterds ' in paris in december 2008 interview : marius zekri -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .

given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .
it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
" this would be a more computerized card and would not be so easy to forge . " the big guns india has called out the big guns to pull off this huge task , tapping nandan nilekani , the 54-year-old founder and former ceo of india 's biggest computer services company , infosys , to head up the effort .
last year , he published a book , " imagining india : ideas for the new century , " that looks at a range of issues confronting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of infosys , nandan m. nilekani , center , will head up the id project " we have the opportunity to give every indian citizen , for the first time , a unique identity , " he said in an interview with the uk daily the times .
" we can transform the country . " nilekani stepped down from his ceo position at infosys two years ago and it is hoped by many that he can bring some of the skills and efficiency of india 's private sector into a public sector best known for its slow-moving bureaucracy .
former microsoft ceo bill gates has indicated he would like to be involved in the project as it develops . while the project has widespread support in india , worries about possible abuse have been voiced .
some say creating one of the world 's biggest storehouses of personal information will attract identity thieves .
others worry about more controversial uses of the ids , like tracking illegal immigrants . government up to it ? chenoy of nehru university said the " mammoth " task of making accurate ids for more than one billion people could be beyond the government 's ability .
he also wondered if poor people with no documentation could face difficulties proving their identities to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter identity cards are one form of id in india now , but not accepted everywhere " i do n't think is possible without some inconvenience or even distress for poorer parts of the population , " he said . the indian government has said the first id cards should be issued within 18 months .
but analysts have said it could take three , four or more years from the cards to reach a majority of india 's citizens . one world 's rahman said he was encouraged by the example of indian national elections that began in april and lasted for one month and were largely praised as running smoothly , despite the logistical challenges they presented .
still , he also expressed doubts about the government 's ability to manage the project successfully . " i do n't want to be paranoid , " he said .

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 30.07.2009 german companies take action to prevent swine flu spread großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is one of the companies taking extra precautions against swine flu many german companies are gearing up for the possibility that swine flu could spread through their extensive work forces .
some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom employees can use the ' hygiene box ' as they enter the canteen preventative measures other companies are also taking preventative measures .
german postal service deutsche post is reportedly considering vaccinations for its employees .
german bank landesbank westlb has told its employees to wash their hands more regularly , and to avoid shaking hands altogether .
other companies have distributed information brochures or set up information hotlines .
when cases of swine flu first broke out , german airline lufthansa began flying company doctors on all flights between mexico and germany – although lufthansa spokesman bernd hoffmann told deutsche welle that this is no longer the case .
mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .
dr. doellinger says many people die each year from regular influenza , and swine flu , in comparison , is quite mild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have not cancelled holiday travel because of swine flu fears " there is a completely incorrect impression in the media , " he says .
however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .
" all the things we should and could be doing anyway , " he says .

its first webcast of mozart 's " cosi fan tutte " debuts at just a fraction of the live ticket price . the new production of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's 1790 opera " cosi fan tutte , " featuring french soprano patricia petitbon and danish baritone bo skovhus , premieres thursday as part of the month-long salzburg festival , which opened last weekend . opera-goers with tickets to the event have paid up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 522 -rrb- for seats .
webcasters who tune in digitally several hours after the curtain falls pay just 7.90 euros and can access the show for up to two weeks . the salzburg festival follows the example of the equally elite bayreuth festival , which began offering webcasts of selected opera performances last year . with public viewing , however , salzburg took the lead .
it has been broadcasting performances live and free of charge since 2002 , while bayreuth jumped on the bandwagon just last year . drama behind the scenes the salzburg festival gained prestige under the leadership of conductor herbert von karajan in the 1950s .
unlike the bayreuth festival , it offers a wide mix of opera , instrumental concerts and theater . the organization has been plagued by a recent series of personnel changes , with both artistic director juergen flimm and business chief gerbert schaighofer cutting their contracts short to leave in 2011 . flimm , who has been offered a job at the berlin state opera , is to be replaced by the current head of the zurich opera , alexander pereira . kjb / cn / afp / dpa editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its first webcast of mozart 's " cosi fan tutte " debuts at just a fraction of the live ticket price . the new production of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's 1790 opera " cosi fan tutte , " featuring french soprano patricia petitbon and danish baritone bo skovhus , premieres thursday as part of the month-long salzburg festival , which opened last weekend . opera-goers with tickets to the event have paid up to 370 euros -lrb- $ 522 -rrb- for seats .
webcasters who tune in digitally several hours after the curtain falls pay just 7.90 euros and can access the show for up to two weeks . the salzburg festival follows the example of the equally elite bayreuth festival , which began offering webcasts of selected opera performances last year . with public viewing , however , salzburg took the lead .
it has been broadcasting performances live and free of charge since 2002 , while bayreuth jumped on the bandwagon just last year . drama behind the scenes the salzburg festival gained prestige under the leadership of conductor herbert von karajan in the 1950s .
unlike the bayreuth festival , it offers a wide mix of opera , instrumental concerts and theater . the organization has been plagued by a recent series of personnel changes , with both artistic director juergen flimm and business chief gerbert schaighofer cutting their contracts short to leave in 2011 . flimm , who has been offered a job at the berlin state opera , is to be replaced by the current head of the zurich opera , alexander pereira . kjb / cn / afp / dpa editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

" it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .

concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .

some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom employees can use the ' hygiene box ' as they enter the canteen preventative measures other companies are also taking preventative measures .

german bank landesbank westlb has told its employees to wash their hands more regularly , and to avoid shaking hands altogether .
other companies have distributed information brochures or set up information hotlines .
when cases of swine flu first broke out , german airline lufthansa began flying company doctors on all flights between mexico and germany – although lufthansa spokesman bernd hoffmann told deutsche welle that this is no longer the case .
mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .
dr. doellinger says many people die each year from regular influenza , and swine flu , in comparison , is quite mild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have not cancelled holiday travel because of swine flu fears " there is a completely incorrect impression in the media , " he says .
however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 30.07.2009 india plans biometric ids for all its 1.16 billion citizens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , india has a patchwork of local ids india is undertaking an ambitious plan to provide identification cards to all its citizens to tackle poverty and fight terrorism .
given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .
it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
" this would be a more computerized card and would not be so easy to forge . " the big guns india has called out the big guns to pull off this huge task , tapping nandan nilekani , the 54-year-old founder and former ceo of india 's biggest computer services company , infosys , to head up the effort .
last year , he published a book , " imagining india : ideas for the new century , " that looks at a range of issues confronting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of infosys , nandan m. nilekani , center , will head up the id project " we have the opportunity to give every indian citizen , for the first time , a unique identity , " he said in an interview with the uk daily the times .
" we can transform the country . " nilekani stepped down from his ceo position at infosys two years ago and it is hoped by many that he can bring some of the skills and efficiency of india 's private sector into a public sector best known for its slow-moving bureaucracy .
former microsoft ceo bill gates has indicated he would like to be involved in the project as it develops . while the project has widespread support in india , worries about possible abuse have been voiced .
some say creating one of the world 's biggest storehouses of personal information will attract identity thieves .
others worry about more controversial uses of the ids , like tracking illegal immigrants . government up to it ? chenoy of nehru university said the " mammoth " task of making accurate ids for more than one billion people could be beyond the government 's ability .
he also wondered if poor people with no documentation could face difficulties proving their identities to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter identity cards are one form of id in india now , but not accepted everywhere " i do n't think is possible without some inconvenience or even distress for poorer parts of the population , " he said . the indian government has said the first id cards should be issued within 18 months .
but analysts have said it could take three , four or more years from the cards to reach a majority of india 's citizens . one world 's rahman said he was encouraged by the example of indian national elections that began in april and lasted for one month and were largely praised as running smoothly , despite the logistical challenges they presented .
still , he also expressed doubts about the government 's ability to manage the project successfully . " i do n't want to be paranoid , " he said .
" but with many government schemes , a very good intention ultimately does n't always get implemented in the right spirit , " he said . author : kyle james editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .
it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .

given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .
it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
" this would be a more computerized card and would not be so easy to forge . " the big guns india has called out the big guns to pull off this huge task , tapping nandan nilekani , the 54-year-old founder and former ceo of india 's biggest computer services company , infosys , to head up the effort .
last year , he published a book , " imagining india : ideas for the new century , " that looks at a range of issues confronting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of infosys , nandan m. nilekani , center , will head up the id project " we have the opportunity to give every indian citizen , for the first time , a unique identity , " he said in an interview with the uk daily the times .
" we can transform the country . " nilekani stepped down from his ceo position at infosys two years ago and it is hoped by many that he can bring some of the skills and efficiency of india 's private sector into a public sector best known for its slow-moving bureaucracy .
former microsoft ceo bill gates has indicated he would like to be involved in the project as it develops . while the project has widespread support in india , worries about possible abuse have been voiced .
some say creating one of the world 's biggest storehouses of personal information will attract identity thieves .
others worry about more controversial uses of the ids , like tracking illegal immigrants . government up to it ? chenoy of nehru university said the " mammoth " task of making accurate ids for more than one billion people could be beyond the government 's ability .
he also wondered if poor people with no documentation could face difficulties proving their identities to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter identity cards are one form of id in india now , but not accepted everywhere " i do n't think is possible without some inconvenience or even distress for poorer parts of the population , " he said . the indian government has said the first id cards should be issued within 18 months .
but analysts have said it could take three , four or more years from the cards to reach a majority of india 's citizens . one world 's rahman said he was encouraged by the example of indian national elections that began in april and lasted for one month and were largely praised as running smoothly , despite the logistical challenges they presented .
still , he also expressed doubts about the government 's ability to manage the project successfully . " i do n't want to be paranoid , " he said .

some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .

however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .

some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom employees can use the ' hygiene box ' as they enter the canteen preventative measures other companies are also taking preventative measures .
german postal service deutsche post is reportedly considering vaccinations for its employees .
german bank landesbank westlb has told its employees to wash their hands more regularly , and to avoid shaking hands altogether .
other companies have distributed information brochures or set up information hotlines .
when cases of swine flu first broke out , german airline lufthansa began flying company doctors on all flights between mexico and germany – although lufthansa spokesman bernd hoffmann told deutsche welle that this is no longer the case .
mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .
dr. doellinger says many people die each year from regular influenza , and swine flu , in comparison , is quite mild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have not cancelled holiday travel because of swine flu fears " there is a completely incorrect impression in the media , " he says .
however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .
" all the things we should and could be doing anyway , " he says .

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .
every parliamentarian has a constitutional right to ask the government questions and the right to be given open and concrete answers , montag says .
" it is a large part of our parliamentary work and now there can be an end to the vague non-answers of the government . "
renate kuenast , head of the green parliamentary faction , declared that the constitutional court has " put the breaks on de-democratization . " db / dpa / afp / ddp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 30.07.2009 eu to insist on equal access in us swift data-sharing deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants equal access with the us to swift data the european union will insist on being given equal access to us data on swift bank transfers when the two sides negotiate a permanent deal on information-sharing as a way of fighting terrorism . the eu will " ensure full , perfect reciprocity " in access to european and us swift data files , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot told journalists in brussels .
that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .

the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .
every parliamentarian has a constitutional right to ask the government questions and the right to be given open and concrete answers , montag says .
" it is a large part of our parliamentary work and now there can be an end to the vague non-answers of the government . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : iraq : the rocky road to democracy and stability power struggles at heart of iraq impasse threaten fragile security experts fear integration of former insurgents threatens iraq 's security iraq 's elections will feature less us presence , but more concerns iraq at a crossroads : a return to chaos or are better times ahead ? iraq -pipe- 30.07.2009 british troops leave uncertain legacy as iraq occupation ends großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with britain 's withdrawal , iraq will have to take care of its own security for the majority of british forces in iraq , their six-year occupation comes to an end on july 31 , a deadline set in an accord signed between london and baghdad in 2008 for the full withdrawal of british troops . the withdrawal of all but approximately four hundred service personnel of the remaining 4000 british troops still on iraqi soil brings to an end a six-year occupation during which – at its height in the months after the 2003 invasion – saw 46,000 troops involved in combat operations , making britain the second-biggest member of the us-led coalition .
britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been .

" it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .

the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .
" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .

" the real test will come when the iraqis do n't have the air support or back-up from the coalition . "
giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .

giles merritt , the director of the security & defense agenda forum europe , a brussels-based think-tank , has similar concerns about a possible return to ethnic violence .
" we can only hope that iraq 's central government can deal with this situation as well as the us and britain believe it can , " he said .
" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .
the best case scenario would be that iraq remains hard to govern but not ungovernable .
learning the lessons from a costly war while success and failure may be difficult to assess , both felstead and merritt believe that it 's important that britain learns lessons from its involvement in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes were made before , during and after the iraq war " by placing so much emphasis on the removal of saddam hussein , the british and the americans ignored all the expert advice , " merritt said .
" while saddam was a brutal dictator , he actually kept the lid on the pot and controlled the warring factions .
once he was gone , the coalition found out that iraq was not a real country as westerners would perceive one and that it had no real social cohesion .
it 's a patchwork nation , like afghanistan , and this was where the post-invasion disaster began . "
merritt wonders whether any lessons were learned from the iraq war .
" one would hope that , militarily , it will have become clear if you send troops into a war without an exit strategy , with no real understanding of the tribal rivalries and historical feuds , and with no appreciation of the politics of the country with which you 're engaging , it 's asking for trouble . "
as far as the political aspects are concerned , merriit argues that there was no political concept in place for iraq . " the same can be said , sadly , for afghanistan . "
" no-one had any real idea what was going to happen once the invasion was over , " said felstead .
for instance , he said , the americans and british were getting intelligence from iraqi exiles which were telling them they would be greeted as heroes , as liberators .
" the military and political planners had no concept of the reality of the situation and made some disastrous mistakes , such as disbanding the army .
one must hope that both nations leave iraq with a clearer idea of what it means to understand the intricacies of a nation and its culture , and learn from these mistakes . "

britain began its scaling back at the turn of the year when it returned the southern basra province and its airport to iraqi control and then formally ceased combat operations and began its full withdrawal from the region on march 31 .
the british then transferred authority of its military headquarters in basra to the united states at the end of april .
at the beginning of june , britain and iraq signed a draft agreement for british naval personnel to remain in the country beyond the agreed withdrawal date .
according to the iraqi government , around 400 british service personnel and five naval vessels would remain in the country in a " non-renewable " one-year deal .
by 2010 , even these troops will be gone and britain 's total withdrawal will be complete .
the withdrawal comes as britain 's defence secretary bob ainsworth criticized his government in a newspaper interview in which he said it did not do enough to support frontline troops in the first years of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . ainsworth said service personnel had been justified in their anger at a lack of interest in their efforts , from both the government and the wider public , in the early stages of the conflicts . but he also told the daily telegraph on friday that improvements had been made over the last two years to recognise and support the armed services . " people were pretty cheesed off with the attitude not only of the government , but of the british public , " he said .
" they -lrb- troops -rrb- were out there in iraq , they were out there in afghanistan , they were doing hard yards and putting their lives on the line - and nobody back here was nearly as interested as they ought to have been . " training of iraqi forces gives military confidence what the british leave behind in terms of the future security of the southern regions will be their legacy .
how basra responds to the end of operation telic will say much about whether it was a successful mission or not .
peter felstead , the editor of jane 's defense weekly , told deutsche welle that he believes that the stability of the south once the british and us forces finally leave will depend much on the training the iraqi forces received from the british .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi forces , trained by the british , fought hard for basra " the situation in basra is certainly better than it was but in terms of the contribution of the british to security , the most significant must be the training of the iraqi forces , " felstead said .
" the most significant operation which did much to wrestle control of the city from the militias and insurgents was the charge of the knights , an iraqi-led mission in march 2008 . " it was the largest iraqi operation since the 2003 invasion , explains felstead and adds that the iraqis prevailed after some heavy , street-to-street fighting . " it was real baptism of fire for many of the units and some of them broke but it was this operation which made them into a fighting force and gave them the belief that they could secure their own country . "
the fact that the iraqis could mount such an operation and defeat the mahdi army and other militias , and then secure and patrol iraq 's southern maritime borders is testament to the training they had from the british , said felstead .
concerns over violence in post-occupation basra despite western assertions that iraqi forces can keep the peace in basra and the south , there are concerns that when the british leave for good , followed by the full withdrawal of us forces over the next two years , the violence experienced during the post-invasion insurgency and escalating ethnic conflicts will explode once more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are high about a return to militia warfare " it is possible we will see fighting between militias again and also between militias and the iraqi military once the british and us forces leave , " felstead said .

" the initial signs are quite positive but structural problems remain and these ethnic rivalries run deep . "
for merritt the worst case scenario would be if the north and south of the country split up , with the north breaking away to form a new kurdistan - which would prove disastrous if turkey were to get involved - and with the south descending into a militia war , with the government , military and police taking sides .

given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .

it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .

" the elections in moldova met many international standards , but the process underscored the need for continued democratic reforms to restore public trust , " the osce said in a statement . " i am encouraged by the conduct of these elections .
many osce commitments were met , but important challenges remain , " added petros efthymiou , the head of the osce observers , before adding that moldova had to work more on democratic reforms in order to win the trust of voters . pro-west parties ready to discuss coalition initial results from the election showed that moldova 's pro-west opposition had unexpectedly defeated the communist party in the tight legislative elections , winning more seats combined than the communists . the pro-west opposition , which is pushing for closer ties with the european union in contrast to the communists who are far more enthusiastic about keeping friendly links to russia , moldova 's former soviet patron , were working to form a coalition after their surprise victory . the three traditionally largest parties of the anti-communist opposition – the liberal democrats , the liberal party and the our moldova coalition – together were set to win 40 seats , the central election commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldovan opposition leader vlad filat has waited a long time vlad filat , head of the liberal democrats , said he believed that opposition leaders could put together a coalition .
" after eight years of authoritarianism , democratic development is possible in this country , " he told reporters .
" democracy and truth have finally been victorious .
we fought for this for so long and with many difficulties . " marian lupu , whose centrist democratic party is a key player in forming a viable government after the election , ruled out any two-party pact with the ruling communist party . " we will not go into a bilateral coalition with the communist party , " said lupu , whose party took fourth place and is likely to win 13 seats .
" i understand that such an alliance will preserve the existing situation in the country – one that is far from good . " i know the mentality of the communists .
it is impossible to form a coalition with them , " said lupu , whose defection from the communist party to the democratic party appears to have contributed much to the transformation of moldova 's political landscape . " our intention is to contribute to a constructive start , a very active start , a balanced start in line with the democratic party style , seeking to form a broad coalition , " he said . serafim urechean , the head of our moldova , told moldovan television that his party was willing to begin coalition negotiations , but only if lupu 's former communist allegiances were truly a thing of the past .
" we are ready to work with the democratic party if it is definitively separated from the communist party , " he said . communist party destined for opposition role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin 's reign comes to an end in defeat for his party the communist party , led by strongman president vladimir voronin , received by far the most votes in wednesday 's polls , but its share of 45.07 percent of the vote was exceeded by the tally of four main opposition parties combined . this gives the communists only 48 seats in the new parliament and its opponents 53 seats , the central election commission said in figures published thursday , based on 98.3 percent of ballots counted . " the communist party will have to join the ranks of the opposition and must not disturb moldova on its path towards european integration , " said dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party . the new parliament must also choose a successor to voronin , who has served out the maximum two four-year terms . despite maintaining that the communists will not be approached to become part of any ruling coalition , the opposition parties will have to call on some communist support if they are to choose the next president , as a three-fifths majority in parliament is required to choose the head of state . wednesday 's election comes less than four months after the last polls in which the communists won about 50 percent of the vote but were accused of fraud , prompting huge numbers of young activists to take to the streets after spreading the word via internet tools like twitter and facebook . the street protests culminated in the sacking and burning of the parliament building in chisinau by young rioters , which russia and voronin 's communists blamed on interference from romania . nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some have cut back on business travel , while others have come up with simpler measures . the number of cases of swine flu in germany has jumped dramatically recently , especially as holidaymakers have returned home with more than just a few photographs .
health experts say that germans are just as likely to contract swine flu by staying at home as they are by travelling overseas .
however , for many german companies , the risk of travel is too great , and some have begun cutting back on business trips .
husam azrak , a spokesman at german telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , says they have advised their employees to consider whether travel is necessary , and to make use of telephone or video conferences if not .
he says employees have also been given the opportunity to stay at home if there is an emergency .
" stay at home , go to the doctor … and do n't come to the office - just in case , " mr. azrak says .
deutsche telekom has also installed several so-called ' hygiene boxes ' at the entrance to the canteen in their bonn headquarters .
the small boxes provide an automated squirt of liquid disinfectant when you place your hands inside .
mr. azrak says the company can not force its employees to use the boxes , but says many of the 3000 employees in the building choose to do so .

when cases of swine flu first broke out , german airline lufthansa began flying company doctors on all flights between mexico and germany – although lufthansa spokesman bernd hoffmann told deutsche welle that this is no longer the case .
mr. hoffmann also said that lufthansa had informed its employees about swine flu and had prepared a plan in case of an emergency but he did not provide the details .
be aware , but not afraid there are currently over 4,000 cases of swine flu in germany , which dr. walter doellinger , the state secretary at the ministry of health in the state of north-rhine-westphalia , says is a number comparable to the amount of people who fall ill from normal influenza during the winter months .
dr. doellinger says many people die each year from regular influenza , and swine flu , in comparison , is quite mild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have not cancelled holiday travel because of swine flu fears " there is a completely incorrect impression in the media , " he says .
however , dr. doellinger also says that the number of serious cases of swine flu is expected to rise when the number of cases overall increases later this year with the onset of colder weather .
dr. doellinger says hygiene is important when trying to avoid contracting the virus , but special measures , such as the ' hygiene boxes ' at deutsche telekom , are not really necessary .
" i think you can achieve the same thing with soap , " he says .
" a disinfectant solution works a little bit better , but in fact the normal hygiene measures are sufficient . "
the washing of hands is important he says , as is using handkerchiefs or tissues .

will the carrier 's newly-announced savings program be enough to keep it aloft ? after managing a small profit in the first half of the year , lufthansa chairman and ceo wolfgang mayrhuber announced thursday that the airline will cut a billion euros of costs between now and 2011 .
" the figures speak for themselves .
crises ruthlessly reveal the weak points and we shall act , " mayrhuber said in a statement .
the company said it would outline where it planned to make cuts in the coming weeks .
revenues fell over 15 percent from the same period last year to 10.2 billion euros .
profits fell from 677 million euros for the first half of 2008 to eight million in the first half of this year .
" they were within the range of expectations , although i also think the expectations were no longer very high because we 're all aware that the market is bad , " frank skodzik , an analyst with commerzbank in frankfurt , told deutsche welle .
the airline carried a total of 33.2 million passengers in the first six months of 2009 , a decrease of 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier .

"
movies should n't pretend to be about reality , he told dw . " inglourious basterds " premiered in germany this week and opens in theaters on aug .
20 . deutsche welle : mr. waltz , you received the golden palm at this year 's cannes festival for your role as colonel hans landa in quentin tarantino 's new film " inglorious basterds . "
has this award opened doors for you ? christoph waltz : not immediately , but it 's starting to .
there are some possibilities - we 'll see what becomes of them . what was the production like for you ?
the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .
i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .
how large is his role in the film that you as an actor were able to have such an influence ? 99.99 percent . bildunterschrift : quentin tarantino on the set of ' inglourious basterds ' in paris in december 2008 interview : marius zekri -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .

when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .

instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .

i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .
how large is his role in the film that you as an actor were able to have such an influence ? 99.99 percent . bildunterschrift : quentin tarantino on the set of ' inglourious basterds ' in paris in december 2008 interview : marius zekri -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is not enough , the judges stressed to issue a blanket refusal justified by the need to maintain secrecy .
the government 's claim that such information is classified , the judges confirmed , is " not plausible . " parliamentarians ' right to information is of great importance , the court said in its ruling , because their observation by intelligence services carries " considerable risks with regard to their independence . "
in 2006 , the opposition green party had requested information on whether the german foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- was gathering data on certain parliamentarians .
the government refused to answer the request on grounds that this would compromise the agency 's intelligence-gathering methods and thus have a negative effect on the work of the bnd .
the government agreed only to provide information to the parliamentary supervisory body , which oversees sensitive intelligence activities , and to the so-called council of elders , a panel that manages internal parliamentary affairs .
a step in the right direction for green party member jerzy montag , it was important to reverse what appeard to be a trend of giving too much power to the government : " the government , parliamentarians , and parliament are the centre of the democratic state .
and it is there that decisions need to be taken .
the government is a part of the constitution but one that is voted for by parliamentarians .
parliament has to come first and then the government .
and the court 's decision has helped us with this . "
the ruling will , montag is convinced , make it more difficult for the government to dodge tricky questions .
every parliamentarian has a constitutional right to ask the government questions and the right to be given open and concrete answers , montag says .
" it is a large part of our parliamentary work and now there can be an end to the vague non-answers of the government . "

that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

it is the second attack in the country in as many days and has been blamed on eta . the attack occurred near a civil guard barracks in palmanova on the western coast of the island . two civil guard officers , aged in their twenties , were killed after the vehicle that they entered exploded .
the bombers , suspected of belonging to the basque separatist group eta , are believed to have triggered explosives under the vehicle by remote control . later , another bomb attached to a police car was discovered close by .
residents were vacated , and the bomb was destroyed in a controlled explosion . the initial attack prompted authorities briefly to seal air- and sea exits from the island , in a bid to prevent suspects from fleeing .
however , palma de mallorca airport , spain 's third busiest , was re-opened within two hours . the european union condemned the attack as " barbaric " .
a statement released by the eu 's executive also reaffirmed the bloc 's support for spain in its " fight against terrorism . " bildunterschrift : eta 's attacks during the tourist season aim to hurt the government 's coffers violence mounts ahead of eta anniversary thursday 's violence comes on the heels of a similar bombing on wednesday , and one day ahead of the 50th anniversary of eta 's founding , though the group has not claimed responsibility for the attacks . early on wednesday morning , a car-bomb attack on a police barracks in burgos in northern spain injured around 60 people and caused extensive damage to the building and its surrounds . police said there was no telephone warning ahead of the attack , unlike many eta bombings in the past , and this contributed to the high number of casualties . there were around 120 people in the barracks and surrounding buildings , many of them children , when the explosion occurred at 4am . eta often plants bombs in spain during the tourist season as part of its campaign to gain a separate homeland in the basque region , which straddles parts of northern spain and southern france . on friday , the group marks fifty years since the day it secretly formed to fight for basque self-determination under the then repressive regime of general francisco franco . since first resorting to violence in the sixties , the group is accused of killing over 800 people . although polls indicate that most basque 's are in favor of greater separation from spain , support for eta 's violence has waned in recent years . the last fatal attack attributed to eta was in june , when a booby-trapped car killed an anti-terrorist police officer in the basque city of bilbao . peace talks with the government broke down in december 2006 following a car bomb attack in madrid. nw / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 30.07.2009 india plans biometric ids for all its 1.16 billion citizens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right now , india has a patchwork of local ids india is undertaking an ambitious plan to provide identification cards to all its citizens to tackle poverty and fight terrorism .
given india 's population , the id plan will be one of the world 's biggest it projects . the plan , which is being called " humongous " and " mind-boggling " by even those closely involved , aims to give each of india 's 1.16 billion people a biometric id card - this in a country where many rural and poor people have no documentation whatsoever to prove their identities . but government officials say within three years , indian citizens will each carry a plastic card with a computer chip containing personal data and proof of identity , such as a fingerprint or iris scan . others say four or more years is more realistic , but most agree that the id could improve the lives of many , especially india 's disadvantaged , by cutting down on the fraud that often steers cash meant for the poor and rural communities into the pockets of corrupt officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the goals of the project is to increase security , especially after the mumbai terror attacks " then every individual , like in any developed country , becomes part of a national registry and the data is available to authorities whether he goes to apply for a job or apply for subsidized food assistance , " said naimur rahman , director of one world , a delhi-based ngo that works on rural and poverty issues . the issue of identification in india is a tangled one .
there are some 20 forms of id , ranging from food ration cards to birth certificates to tax documents , and not every id is accepted by every office or agency . to untangle it all , the new id would be accepted everywhere . poverty and terror fight one aim is to bring down fraud , especially when it comes to poverty-reduction programs , which are looked upon with skepticism by many since much of the money earmarked for the poor never makes it to them .
it 's estimated that corruption siphons off as much as 80 percent of anti-poverty funds . " it will have some impact , " said sharad magajan of oxfam india .
" identification is a big problem . " the new plastic card could also help beef up national security and intelligence gathering , high on indians ' minds after last november 's terrorist attacks in mumbai , which killed 179 people .
the attacks were carried out by militants from pakistan . " one major goal -lrb- of the id project -rrb- is about terrorists because the other kinds of id were easy to forge , " said kamal chenoy , professor of international studies at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi .
" this would be a more computerized card and would not be so easy to forge . " the big guns india has called out the big guns to pull off this huge task , tapping nandan nilekani , the 54-year-old founder and former ceo of india 's biggest computer services company , infosys , to head up the effort .
last year , he published a book , " imagining india : ideas for the new century , " that looks at a range of issues confronting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ceo of infosys , nandan m. nilekani , center , will head up the id project " we have the opportunity to give every indian citizen , for the first time , a unique identity , " he said in an interview with the uk daily the times .
" we can transform the country . " nilekani stepped down from his ceo position at infosys two years ago and it is hoped by many that he can bring some of the skills and efficiency of india 's private sector into a public sector best known for its slow-moving bureaucracy .
former microsoft ceo bill gates has indicated he would like to be involved in the project as it develops . while the project has widespread support in india , worries about possible abuse have been voiced .
some say creating one of the world 's biggest storehouses of personal information will attract identity thieves .
others worry about more controversial uses of the ids , like tracking illegal immigrants . government up to it ? chenoy of nehru university said the " mammoth " task of making accurate ids for more than one billion people could be beyond the government 's ability .
he also wondered if poor people with no documentation could face difficulties proving their identities to authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter identity cards are one form of id in india now , but not accepted everywhere " i do n't think is possible without some inconvenience or even distress for poorer parts of the population , " he said . the indian government has said the first id cards should be issued within 18 months .
but analysts have said it could take three , four or more years from the cards to reach a majority of india 's citizens . one world 's rahman said he was encouraged by the example of indian national elections that began in april and lasted for one month and were largely praised as running smoothly , despite the logistical challenges they presented .
still , he also expressed doubts about the government 's ability to manage the project successfully . " i do n't want to be paranoid , " he said .
" but with many government schemes , a very good intention ultimately does n't always get implemented in the right spirit , " he said . author : kyle james editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 30.07.2009 eu to insist on equal access in us swift data-sharing deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants equal access with the us to swift data the european union will insist on being given equal access to us data on swift bank transfers when the two sides negotiate a permanent deal on information-sharing as a way of fighting terrorism . the eu will " ensure full , perfect reciprocity " in access to european and us swift data files , eu justice commissioner jacques barrot told journalists in brussels .
that would give the authorities in the eu the right to look at data on bank transfers stored on us servers and to use them to track down terrorist networks , a right the us authorities already have .
barrot 's statement came after eu foreign ministers on monday mandated sweden , current holder of the bloc 's presidency , to start talks with the us on an interim data-sharing agreement . swift system no stranger to controversy the international system for bank transfers known as swift , manages international bank transfers from more than 200 countries .
in 2006 , the company found itself embroiled in controversy , when it was discovered that transfer data was being monitored by us intelligence .
the organization held a so-called ' mirror ' server in the us , logging all the activity on its european system , giving us authorities access to information , in a way that was deemed unlawful by the eu .
at the time , swift defended its actions saying it was bound by us law , in the fight against terrorism .
swift is now set to move its servers to europe in a bid to protect users ' privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was monitoring swift data servers in 2006 but us anti-terror agencies , who have hitherto been able to use the swift data to track terrorist financing because the computers holding those data were on their territory , want to keep that access - a request that would require a new international agreement .
for internal reasons , the eu is not yet in a position to sign a permanent deal , leaving a security gap of a few months , in which us officials can not access the information on the servers in europe .
the eu wants to make sure that any future deal is approved by the european parliament .
that will only be possible if the bloc 's lisbon treaty is brought into force - something not expected to happen until at least the end of the year .
to avoid a " security gap , " eu member states therefore want to set up an interim deal extending the current system while they negotiate a new , more balanced deal with the us .
interim deal angers parliamentarians eu foreign ministers cleared the way for such a deal on monday , which annoyed european parliamentarians , who think they are being sidelined .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot rejected claims of cutting meps out of the loop but eu justice chief barrot has rejected that claim , saying that the parliament would be fully consulted on any final deal and accusing the critics of " twisting the truth . "
" we are finding it very difficult to understand why the facts have been twisted , and i thought i had put it before the parliament in a very objective way , " barrot said .
the data-sharing agreement is also deeply controversial as european civil liberties groups believe it violates privacy rights .
barrot insists the us only wants the information to fight terrorism , which is a common goal .
" it 's not just to keep the us happy , but rather , we want to ensure that the fight against terrorism is not interrupted in any way . "
eu wants equal access in any deal the european commission is also now stressing the deal is a two-way street and that in any permanent agreement , it will negotiate unfettered access to banking information held by the us .
barrot wants to soothe concerns over how the information would be used .
" we are convinced that the american treasury is just using this for anti-terrorist purposes and they are not keeping that data beyond a certain period . "
the bottom line , he says , is that it would be very dangerous , at this point , to stop the surveillance of information flows , while a new deal is negotiated .
but that does not seem have won over the critics- which is why brussels is using a different argument now- saying it will demand equal access to us data .

" the elections in moldova met many international standards , but the process underscored the need for continued democratic reforms to restore public trust , " the osce said in a statement . " i am encouraged by the conduct of these elections .
many osce commitments were met , but important challenges remain , " added petros efthymiou , the head of the osce observers , before adding that moldova had to work more on democratic reforms in order to win the trust of voters . pro-west parties ready to discuss coalition initial results from the election showed that moldova 's pro-west opposition had unexpectedly defeated the communist party in the tight legislative elections , winning more seats combined than the communists . the pro-west opposition , which is pushing for closer ties with the european union in contrast to the communists who are far more enthusiastic about keeping friendly links to russia , moldova 's former soviet patron , were working to form a coalition after their surprise victory . the three traditionally largest parties of the anti-communist opposition – the liberal democrats , the liberal party and the our moldova coalition – together were set to win 40 seats , the central election commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldovan opposition leader vlad filat has waited a long time vlad filat , head of the liberal democrats , said he believed that opposition leaders could put together a coalition .
" after eight years of authoritarianism , democratic development is possible in this country , " he told reporters .
" democracy and truth have finally been victorious .
we fought for this for so long and with many difficulties . " marian lupu , whose centrist democratic party is a key player in forming a viable government after the election , ruled out any two-party pact with the ruling communist party . " we will not go into a bilateral coalition with the communist party , " said lupu , whose party took fourth place and is likely to win 13 seats .
" i understand that such an alliance will preserve the existing situation in the country – one that is far from good . " i know the mentality of the communists .
it is impossible to form a coalition with them , " said lupu , whose defection from the communist party to the democratic party appears to have contributed much to the transformation of moldova 's political landscape . " our intention is to contribute to a constructive start , a very active start , a balanced start in line with the democratic party style , seeking to form a broad coalition , " he said . serafim urechean , the head of our moldova , told moldovan television that his party was willing to begin coalition negotiations , but only if lupu 's former communist allegiances were truly a thing of the past .
" we are ready to work with the democratic party if it is definitively separated from the communist party , " he said . communist party destined for opposition role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voronin 's reign comes to an end in defeat for his party the communist party , led by strongman president vladimir voronin , received by far the most votes in wednesday 's polls , but its share of 45.07 percent of the vote was exceeded by the tally of four main opposition parties combined . this gives the communists only 48 seats in the new parliament and its opponents 53 seats , the central election commission said in figures published thursday , based on 98.3 percent of ballots counted . " the communist party will have to join the ranks of the opposition and must not disturb moldova on its path towards european integration , " said dorin chirtoaca , deputy head of the opposition liberal party . the new parliament must also choose a successor to voronin , who has served out the maximum two four-year terms . despite maintaining that the communists will not be approached to become part of any ruling coalition , the opposition parties will have to call on some communist support if they are to choose the next president , as a three-fifths majority in parliament is required to choose the head of state . wednesday 's election comes less than four months after the last polls in which the communists won about 50 percent of the vote but were accused of fraud , prompting huge numbers of young activists to take to the streets after spreading the word via internet tools like twitter and facebook . the street protests culminated in the sacking and burning of the parliament building in chisinau by young rioters , which russia and voronin 's communists blamed on interference from romania . nda / afp / dpa / ap / reuters editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
movies should n't pretend to be about reality , he told dw . " inglourious basterds " premiered in germany this week and opens in theaters on aug .
20 . deutsche welle : mr. waltz , you received the golden palm at this year 's cannes festival for your role as colonel hans landa in quentin tarantino 's new film " inglorious basterds . "
has this award opened doors for you ? christoph waltz : not immediately , but it 's starting to .
there are some possibilities - we 'll see what becomes of them . what was the production like for you ?
the film caused quite a stir here in germany well before it came out . i did n't have anything to do with that .
i was fortunate enough to be there in the babelsberg film studio .
if not , i would have envied the others very , very much . how were you cast for the role ? in the traditional way .
i almost said " conventional , " but conventional has changed quite a bit over the past few years .
these days casting is mainly done by a group of boasters who have no clue but want to test others on what they do n't know themselves - using the latest equipment , in order to record for a decision maker who 's not even there . with tarantino , it was completely different .
an incredibly polite man invited me for a chat .
then , after getting to know each other a bit , he said : we could take a look at the screenplay .
they created a feeling of lightness , of security .
he took away pressure instead of creating it .
there was n't even a camera there - who would tarantino have been recording it for anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' inglourious basterds ' cast at the cannes festival in may : from left , diane kruger , director quentin tarantino , melanie laurent , mike myers how does one go about creating such a character as colonel landa in front of the camera - such a charming monster ? i prefer to stick to what the author says .
when you have a work by tarantino in front of you , it 's pretty clear that it 's not a book about yourself , but about a character that tarantino has thought up . you are an austrian actor playing a nazi in a hollywood film set in germany .
how did you deal with that ?
were you able to separate yourself from the guilt complex that all post-war germans carry around within themselves ? on the contrary - i gave in to it .
i have a different reading : i do n't think it 's the job of the cinema to be didactic , especially as far as history is concerned .
and even more especially as far as this part of history is concerned .
instead , i think that cinema should be concerned with us .
with us , who are alive today and are watching the film .
in the end i think it 's irresponsible to make movies that give the appearance of dealing with the truth . what do you look for in this role ? that 's the topic of this film : what 's in it for us , what can be reached - if not just the confirmation of what we already know .
we 've already internalized that in its entirety .
why keep showing it ?
as a marketing gag .
i ca n't think of any other reason .
our self-assurance , that we 're on the right side , has become a marketing strategy .
how dishonest can one actually be ? i look for anything in the role that asks questions .
in a film , i can not participate in a historical event , but i can participate in art .
and as an artist , i would do a lot - anything - for tarantino .
the film gives us a new perspective on the world - a new possibility to observe .
and a new view on things might just change our reality . and how should the film change reality ? not reality , but our perspective on it .
you have to change reality yourself . after the film was produced , a great deal of praise was exchanged between tarantino and yourself .
he said , among other things , that you gave his film back to him .
how large is his role in the film that you as an actor were able to have such an influence ? 99.99 percent . bildunterschrift : quentin tarantino on the set of ' inglourious basterds ' in paris in december 2008 interview : marius zekri -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the one-day brecon county show , which attracts around 10,000 people each year , was due to be staged on saturday .
but after days of wet weather , and more rain forecast , it has been cancelled over concerns of waterlogged fields and possible traffic problems .
the show society 's secretary said it would lose up to £ 30,000 .
" the marquees are all up , we 've taken over 1,00 entries for livestock , dogs , sheep ... everything was in place and ready to go , " barbara green said .
" but we had a crisis meeting today after hearing the weather forecast and unfortunately after so much rain and more to come - including on the day itself - there 's nothing we can do but cancel .
" we are very , very disappointed and it was a very hard decision to make as we have been planning it for the last year or so .
but everyone 's been very understanding and we aim to be back next year . "
prince of wales she said the society took a variety of factors into consideration before calling off the show , which claims to be the oldest in the uk and has the prince of wales as a patron .
the show , held in brecon 's showground , was mainly made up of fields and had few footpaths , ms green said , so the ground was likely to become very muddy .
there was also the likelihood that many visitors would not attend and that some competitors would not turn up .
the show 's society feared it would end up having to pay more to tow away vehicles that became stuck in the fields , she said .
" this is the first time in the show 's 254-year history that it 's been cancelled because of the weather , " ms green added .
" it was called off once before in 2001 because of the foot-and-mouth disease restrictions .
but the show went ahead fine the following year so we hope that will be the case this time . "
the cwmtawe 7s , one of the leading rugby sevens in wales , has also been cancelled because of the weather .
the tournament would have begun in pontardawe , swansea valley , this saturday .

" the marquees are all up , we 've taken over 1,00 entries for livestock , dogs , sheep ... everything was in place and ready to go , " barbara green said .
" but we had a crisis meeting today after hearing the weather forecast and unfortunately after so much rain and more to come - including on the day itself - there 's nothing we can do but cancel .
" we are very , very disappointed and it was a very hard decision to make as we have been planning it for the last year or so .
but everyone 's been very understanding and we aim to be back next year . "
prince of wales she said the society took a variety of factors into consideration before calling off the show , which claims to be the oldest in the uk and has the prince of wales as a patron .
the show , held in brecon 's showground , was mainly made up of fields and had few footpaths , ms green said , so the ground was likely to become very muddy .
there was also the likelihood that many visitors would not attend and that some competitors would not turn up .
the show 's society feared it would end up having to pay more to tow away vehicles that became stuck in the fields , she said .
" this is the first time in the show 's 254-year history that it 's been cancelled because of the weather , " ms green added .
" it was called off once before in 2001 because of the foot-and-mouth disease restrictions .
but the show went ahead fine the following year so we hope that will be the case this time . "
the cwmtawe 7s , one of the leading rugby sevens in wales , has also been cancelled because of the weather .
the tournament would have begun in pontardawe , swansea valley , this saturday .

st kilda day : latha hiort has been organised by the gaelic arts agency , with funding from homecoming scotland .
the project has been launched as a follow up to the 2007 st kilda opera , which was staged across europe .
the agency said the day would be held on 29 august .
the last st kildans left on that date in 1930 .
it hopes the celebrations will be held annually . "
st kilda day will increase public awareness of the st kildan story " malcolm maclean gaelic arts agency gaelic arts agency director malcolm maclean said : " the success of the 2007 opera has acted as a catalyst to new ideas about st kilda at a time of grave uncertainty about the islands ' future .
" st kilda day will increase public awareness of the st kildan story and build support for a world-class , remote-access st kilda centre that celebrates the island 's unique spirit-of-place . "
western isles council - comhairle nan eilean siar - is considering the creation of the visitor centre .
building it on hirta has been ruled out because of the difficulties in reaching it .
instead , a feasibility study is to look for a possible site for the centre somewhere on the western isles .
people had lived on st kilda since prehistoric times .
in the 19th century , a series of tourists began to visit st kilda , bringing with them ideas on how to improve the place and st kildans - known as the hiortaich - became more dependent on the outside world .
in the 1850s , 42 of the islanders emigrated to australia , half of them dying on the way .
until that decade ended , their houses had been built from materials that were easily available on hirta , with stone walls , and roofs of thatch or turf .
new lives one of the so-called improvements that came from the outside world was 16 new houses that were built in the village in 1860 .
these new homes were cold , and it was necessary to import coal from the mainland as the supplies of peat on st kilda were not sufficient to heat them .
because of the tourists , the world heard of the st kilda parliament , in which the men met each morning to discuss the day 's tasks .
they also heard about the islanders ' ankles , which were unusually thick and strong from climbing cliffs to hunt seabirds , which were the basis of their economy .
the winter of 1929 was particularly hard on the island and some of the remaining inhabitants died , many having already left .
the remaining 36 islanders wrote to the government asking to be taken off so they could lead new lives on the mainland .
the island was abandoned the following year .
st kilda now has dual unesco world heritage status .
however , owner the national trust for scotland has been concerned about the withdrawal of permanent staff from a military radar station on hirta , the main island in the group .
it said this would leave the islands vulnerable to vandalism by visitors .
