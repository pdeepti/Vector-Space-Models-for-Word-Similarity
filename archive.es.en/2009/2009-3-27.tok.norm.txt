" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .
" our principle remains the same : there can be no security without reconstruction , and there can be reconstruction without security . jp / nda / tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "
separate incident the attack came less than 24 hours after a smaller greek-owned vessel was seized in the same area .
the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .
a greek merchant marine ministry spokesman said the chemical tanker 's russian captain and 18 filipino crew members were in good health and that the boat 's owner , lotus shipping , had begun negotiations with the pirates .
a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .
dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
the latest attacks occurred even though more than 20 warships from the eu , nato , china and russia patrol the area around the horn of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the european union play a more active role in cracking down on piracy ?
the eu launched its first-ever naval operation in december with six warships and three surveillance planes in the region .
but patrolling over a million square miles of ocean is a challenging task , and their presence seems to be little deterrent .
ransom-hunting somali pirates attacked more than 130 merchant ships in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , according to the international maritime bureau .
in the wake of the incidents , greece , which is home to the biggest commercial fleet in the world , called on the eu " to play a more active role " in cracking down on piracy .
merchant marine minister anastasis papaligouras said the eu should " expand the rules of engagement and the area patrolled by the european naval force . "
he also called on shipping companies " to inform with total accuracy and in good time the competent services " about the movements of boats . jp / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
rutten 's backroom coaching team of mike bueskens , youri mulder and oliver reck will take control of the first team until a successor has been found .
former players bueskens and mulder had been caretaker coaches last season after the dismissal of mirko slomka .

schalke also fell at the qualifying stages of the champions league , failed to make it out of the group stages of the uefa cup and were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the german cup .
before his removal from the post , rutten denied he was in talks with psv eindhoven and said he was continuing to focus on his job at schalke .
" i still have a lot of fun working here , " he said .
turmoil at the top schalke are currently looking for a general manager after dismissing andreas mueller earlier this month .

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally . "
addressing the stimulus packages some countries have introduced to address the economic downturn , lamy said , that these would aid economic growth by increasing demand , but some contained elements that favoured domestic goods and services .
preventing another ' great depression ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some national stimulus packages are affecting global growth the report , issued a week before the g20 meeting , highlights one of the key issues for the summit : how to prevent job-shielding trade restrictions that could turn the global recession into a long lasting depression leading to unrest and even war , as happened after wall street collapsed in 1929 .
while the wto has rules for its members on how high they can raise tariffs or boost subsidies , many countries keep their applied rates below the ceiling , giving them varying amounts of room to maneuver .
this means states could implement protectionist measures without actually violating their commitments .
a recent world bank report found that 17 of the g20 leading economies had implemented 47 protectionist measures since pledging not to at a summit last november .
in his report , a copy of which was obtained by the german press agency dpa , lamy called for the completion of the doha round of trade talks and said that , pending the conclusion of negotiations , countries should not use new trade restrictions and trade-distorting subsidies . mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "

the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .
a greek merchant marine ministry spokesman said the chemical tanker 's russian captain and 18 filipino crew members were in good health and that the boat 's owner , lotus shipping , had begun negotiations with the pirates .
a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 27.03.2009 condom controversy continues as top medical journal slams pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no end in sight yet for the condom controversy on a recent tour of africa , pope benedict xvi suggested condoms are unhelpful in the fight against aids .
the controversy reignited after a top medical research journal added its voice to criticism of the pontiff . in an editorial , the lancet said the pontiff 's remarks were " wildly inaccurate " and could have " devastating consequences . "
the journal also questioned whether the pope 's comments were made out of ignorance or as a deliberate attempt to support catholic ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems the whole world is now listening when the pope speaks the lancet , one of the world 's leading medical research journals , was emphatic about the impact of the pontiff 's remarks and has called for the head of the catholic church to retract his remarks .
" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .
unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "
french bishop fuels controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is ravaging much of sub-saharan africa and its victims are both young and old monsignor andre fort , the bishop of the french city of orleans , fanned the flames of the dispute on friday by supporting the pontiff 's view of condoms .
fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "

the controversy reignited after a top medical research journal added its voice to criticism of the pontiff . in an editorial , the lancet said the pontiff 's remarks were " wildly inaccurate " and could have " devastating consequences . "
the journal also questioned whether the pope 's comments were made out of ignorance or as a deliberate attempt to support catholic ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems the whole world is now listening when the pope speaks the lancet , one of the world 's leading medical research journals , was emphatic about the impact of the pontiff 's remarks and has called for the head of the catholic church to retract his remarks .
" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .
unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "
french bishop fuels controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is ravaging much of sub-saharan africa and its victims are both young and old monsignor andre fort , the bishop of the french city of orleans , fanned the flames of the dispute on friday by supporting the pontiff 's view of condoms .
fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .

rutten 's backroom coaching team of mike bueskens , youri mulder and oliver reck will take control of the first team until a successor has been found .

in three rounds of inconclusive balloting on thursday , march 26 , amano , 61 , polled more votes than minty , 69 , but fell short of the 24 required under the agency 's rules .
on friday , the board resorted to two runoff , " yes , no or abstain " ballots for each candidate .
amano took 22 " yes " votes , 12 " no " and one abstention .
minty garnered 15 " yes " votes , 19 " no " with one abstention .
the nuclear watchdog has a 35-member board .
a new ballot is likely to be held in may , possibly with new candidates " the slate of candidates is considered to have been wiped clean , " ambassador taous feroukhi of algeria , chairman of the vienna-based governing board , told reporters .
bridging the rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-baradei had several spats with the bush administration over iran the inconclusive balloting can be attributed to the rich-poor divide that both amano and minty failed to bridge .
amano , japan 's permanent representative and ambassador , had drawn the backing of wealthy - mainly western - nuclear powers .
minty , pretoria 's long-time iaea governor , on the other hand , was supported primarily by developing countries .
" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .
" we were hopeful that those who advocated change and a relationship with the developing world based on trust and partnership would - in this important election process - have implemented these noble ideals , but sadly it appears as this has only remained as good intentions , " he said in a statement to governors .
a senior official from the japanese foreign ministry informed reporters that amano would run again .
amano has been criticized for lacking charisma , while some western nations perceive minty as too outspoken .
the iaea is tasked with detecting secret nuclear bomb programs as well as coordinating global cooperation in sharing energy for peaceful purposes .
egyptian nobel prize-winner el-baradei , who has been director of the iaea since 1997 , has had a difficult job recently , arguing with the bush administration over what he viewed as its warlike approach to resolving iran 's nuclear issue .
in turn , the us has accused him of overstepping his mandate as well as being too " soft " on iran .
iaea has new hope with obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant could be a concern for the new iaea director iaea officials are now hopeful that the us foreign policy under president barack obama will lead to smoother cooperation as well as an increase in the iaea 's budget , which el-baradei has referred to as " shoestring . "
obama has already signaled his readiness to talk without preconditions to iran and syria , which are both under investigation by the iaea .
new candidates who might enter the running to become the new iaea director include former mexican president ernesto zedillo and hungarian tibor toth , head of the un panel monitoring the nuclear-test-ban treaty -lrb- ctbto -rrb- .
new candidates have 28 days from monday to indicate their intentions .
analysts have said that third world members of the iaea favor a politically strong director general , while many europeans and the united states are more interested in having a technocrat run the agency . ls / tt / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

minty , pretoria 's long-time iaea governor , on the other hand , was supported primarily by developing countries .
" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .

in three rounds of inconclusive balloting on thursday , march 26 , amano , 61 , polled more votes than minty , 69 , but fell short of the 24 required under the agency 's rules .
on friday , the board resorted to two runoff , " yes , no or abstain " ballots for each candidate .
amano took 22 " yes " votes , 12 " no " and one abstention .
minty garnered 15 " yes " votes , 19 " no " with one abstention .
the nuclear watchdog has a 35-member board .
a new ballot is likely to be held in may , possibly with new candidates " the slate of candidates is considered to have been wiped clean , " ambassador taous feroukhi of algeria , chairman of the vienna-based governing board , told reporters .
bridging the rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-baradei had several spats with the bush administration over iran the inconclusive balloting can be attributed to the rich-poor divide that both amano and minty failed to bridge .
amano , japan 's permanent representative and ambassador , had drawn the backing of wealthy - mainly western - nuclear powers .
minty , pretoria 's long-time iaea governor , on the other hand , was supported primarily by developing countries .
" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .
" we were hopeful that those who advocated change and a relationship with the developing world based on trust and partnership would - in this important election process - have implemented these noble ideals , but sadly it appears as this has only remained as good intentions , " he said in a statement to governors .
a senior official from the japanese foreign ministry informed reporters that amano would run again .
amano has been criticized for lacking charisma , while some western nations perceive minty as too outspoken .
the iaea is tasked with detecting secret nuclear bomb programs as well as coordinating global cooperation in sharing energy for peaceful purposes .
egyptian nobel prize-winner el-baradei , who has been director of the iaea since 1997 , has had a difficult job recently , arguing with the bush administration over what he viewed as its warlike approach to resolving iran 's nuclear issue .
in turn , the us has accused him of overstepping his mandate as well as being too " soft " on iran .
iaea has new hope with obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant could be a concern for the new iaea director iaea officials are now hopeful that the us foreign policy under president barack obama will lead to smoother cooperation as well as an increase in the iaea 's budget , which el-baradei has referred to as " shoestring . "
obama has already signaled his readiness to talk without preconditions to iran and syria , which are both under investigation by the iaea .
new candidates who might enter the running to become the new iaea director include former mexican president ernesto zedillo and hungarian tibor toth , head of the un panel monitoring the nuclear-test-ban treaty -lrb- ctbto -rrb- .
new candidates have 28 days from monday to indicate their intentions .
analysts have said that third world members of the iaea favor a politically strong director general , while many europeans and the united states are more interested in having a technocrat run the agency . ls / tt / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally . "
addressing the stimulus packages some countries have introduced to address the economic downturn , lamy said , that these would aid economic growth by increasing demand , but some contained elements that favoured domestic goods and services .
preventing another ' great depression ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some national stimulus packages are affecting global growth the report , issued a week before the g20 meeting , highlights one of the key issues for the summit : how to prevent job-shielding trade restrictions that could turn the global recession into a long lasting depression leading to unrest and even war , as happened after wall street collapsed in 1929 .
while the wto has rules for its members on how high they can raise tariffs or boost subsidies , many countries keep their applied rates below the ceiling , giving them varying amounts of room to maneuver .
this means states could implement protectionist measures without actually violating their commitments .
a recent world bank report found that 17 of the g20 leading economies had implemented 47 protectionist measures since pledging not to at a summit last november .
in his report , a copy of which was obtained by the german press agency dpa , lamy called for the completion of the doha round of trade talks and said that , pending the conclusion of negotiations , countries should not use new trade restrictions and trade-distorting subsidies . mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.03.2009 eu refugee policy : right to asylum or prison mentality ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs a unified policy for its streams of refugees despite overcrowded refugee camps on islands such as lampedusa and malta - where thousands of africans have tried to set their foot on european soil illegally - the eu is still lacking a joint asylum policy . when eu justice commissioner jacques barrot recently visited refugee camps on lampedusa and malta , he was horrified by the conditions of the camps .
in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .
" the policy of the commission in this situation is to demonstrate solidarity so that we can help refugees and the eu countries that are trying to handle the situation , " said laitenberger .
solidarity in accepting refugees is one thing .
but german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble already summarized in 2005 how he envisioned eu member states solving the refugee problem .
" in addition to more efficient border controls that they need , they must fight the causes and cooperate with the neighboring states , " he said .
eu has responsibility for refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has put the emphasis on preventing refugees from making it to europe the eu has been trying to prevent streams of refuges this way for several years .
but critics say that the eu 's entire refugee policy is too defensive .
" better protection and more access to lasting solutions in the refugees ' country of origin is a respectable goal " said antónio guterres , the un high commissioner for refugee matters back in 2006 .
" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .
europe is a continent of asylum and must remain this way . "
european parliamentarian wolfgang kreissl-doerfler visited lampedusa four years ago with a parliamentarian group .
he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .
yet these people sometimes do n't even get a chance to apply , particularly in greece and italy . "
" they are not informed about their right to asylum .
they are immediately put in custody , pending deportation , and are then swiftly transported away , " he said .
eu doing too little bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees are flooding the italian island of lampedusa kreissl-doerfler also accused the commission of doing too little to remind countries like italy of their responsibility " yes , the eu could do a lot , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .
so , while solidarity is now being called for by the southern countries , they were n't offering it before . "

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "
separate incident the attack came less than 24 hours after a smaller greek-owned vessel was seized in the same area .
the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .
a greek merchant marine ministry spokesman said the chemical tanker 's russian captain and 18 filipino crew members were in good health and that the boat 's owner , lotus shipping , had begun negotiations with the pirates .
a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .
dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
the latest attacks occurred even though more than 20 warships from the eu , nato , china and russia patrol the area around the horn of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the european union play a more active role in cracking down on piracy ?
the eu launched its first-ever naval operation in december with six warships and three surveillance planes in the region .
but patrolling over a million square miles of ocean is a challenging task , and their presence seems to be little deterrent .
ransom-hunting somali pirates attacked more than 130 merchant ships in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , according to the international maritime bureau .
in the wake of the incidents , greece , which is home to the biggest commercial fleet in the world , called on the eu " to play a more active role " in cracking down on piracy .
merchant marine minister anastasis papaligouras said the eu should " expand the rules of engagement and the area patrolled by the european naval force . "
he also called on shipping companies " to inform with total accuracy and in good time the competent services " about the movements of boats . jp / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the policy of the commission in this situation is to demonstrate solidarity so that we can help refugees and the eu countries that are trying to handle the situation , " said laitenberger .
solidarity in accepting refugees is one thing .

" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .
europe is a continent of asylum and must remain this way . "
european parliamentarian wolfgang kreissl-doerfler visited lampedusa four years ago with a parliamentarian group .
he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .

" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .

so , while solidarity is now being called for by the southern countries , they were n't offering it before . "

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .

"
rutten 's backroom coaching team of mike bueskens , youri mulder and oliver reck will take control of the first team until a successor has been found .
former players bueskens and mulder had been caretaker coaches last season after the dismissal of mirko slomka .

schalke also fell at the qualifying stages of the champions league , failed to make it out of the group stages of the uefa cup and were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the german cup .
before his removal from the post , rutten denied he was in talks with psv eindhoven and said he was continuing to focus on his job at schalke .
" i still have a lot of fun working here , " he said .

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "

the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .

"
rutten 's backroom coaching team of mike bueskens , youri mulder and oliver reck will take control of the first team until a successor has been found .
former players bueskens and mulder had been caretaker coaches last season after the dismissal of mirko slomka .
rutten joined schalke at the beginning of the season on a contract until 2010 , but the team has never looked capable of mounting a bundesliga title challenge .
following sunday 's 2-1 home defeat by sv hamburg , schalke are lying eighth , 12 points behind leaders hertha berlin .
schalke also fell at the qualifying stages of the champions league , failed to make it out of the group stages of the uefa cup and were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the german cup .
before his removal from the post , rutten denied he was in talks with psv eindhoven and said he was continuing to focus on his job at schalke .
" i still have a lot of fun working here , " he said .

in three rounds of inconclusive balloting on thursday , march 26 , amano , 61 , polled more votes than minty , 69 , but fell short of the 24 required under the agency 's rules .
on friday , the board resorted to two runoff , " yes , no or abstain " ballots for each candidate .
amano took 22 " yes " votes , 12 " no " and one abstention .
minty garnered 15 " yes " votes , 19 " no " with one abstention .
the nuclear watchdog has a 35-member board .
a new ballot is likely to be held in may , possibly with new candidates " the slate of candidates is considered to have been wiped clean , " ambassador taous feroukhi of algeria , chairman of the vienna-based governing board , told reporters .
bridging the rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-baradei had several spats with the bush administration over iran the inconclusive balloting can be attributed to the rich-poor divide that both amano and minty failed to bridge .
amano , japan 's permanent representative and ambassador , had drawn the backing of wealthy - mainly western - nuclear powers .
minty , pretoria 's long-time iaea governor , on the other hand , was supported primarily by developing countries .
" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .
" we were hopeful that those who advocated change and a relationship with the developing world based on trust and partnership would - in this important election process - have implemented these noble ideals , but sadly it appears as this has only remained as good intentions , " he said in a statement to governors .
a senior official from the japanese foreign ministry informed reporters that amano would run again .
amano has been criticized for lacking charisma , while some western nations perceive minty as too outspoken .
the iaea is tasked with detecting secret nuclear bomb programs as well as coordinating global cooperation in sharing energy for peaceful purposes .
egyptian nobel prize-winner el-baradei , who has been director of the iaea since 1997 , has had a difficult job recently , arguing with the bush administration over what he viewed as its warlike approach to resolving iran 's nuclear issue .
in turn , the us has accused him of overstepping his mandate as well as being too " soft " on iran .
iaea has new hope with obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant could be a concern for the new iaea director iaea officials are now hopeful that the us foreign policy under president barack obama will lead to smoother cooperation as well as an increase in the iaea 's budget , which el-baradei has referred to as " shoestring . "
obama has already signaled his readiness to talk without preconditions to iran and syria , which are both under investigation by the iaea .
new candidates who might enter the running to become the new iaea director include former mexican president ernesto zedillo and hungarian tibor toth , head of the un panel monitoring the nuclear-test-ban treaty -lrb- ctbto -rrb- .
new candidates have 28 days from monday to indicate their intentions .
analysts have said that third world members of the iaea favor a politically strong director general , while many europeans and the united states are more interested in having a technocrat run the agency . ls / tt / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .
" the policy of the commission in this situation is to demonstrate solidarity so that we can help refugees and the eu countries that are trying to handle the situation , " said laitenberger .
solidarity in accepting refugees is one thing .
but german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble already summarized in 2005 how he envisioned eu member states solving the refugee problem .
" in addition to more efficient border controls that they need , they must fight the causes and cooperate with the neighboring states , " he said .
eu has responsibility for refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has put the emphasis on preventing refugees from making it to europe the eu has been trying to prevent streams of refuges this way for several years .
but critics say that the eu 's entire refugee policy is too defensive .
" better protection and more access to lasting solutions in the refugees ' country of origin is a respectable goal " said antónio guterres , the un high commissioner for refugee matters back in 2006 .
" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .
europe is a continent of asylum and must remain this way . "
european parliamentarian wolfgang kreissl-doerfler visited lampedusa four years ago with a parliamentarian group .
he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .
yet these people sometimes do n't even get a chance to apply , particularly in greece and italy . "
" they are not informed about their right to asylum .
they are immediately put in custody , pending deportation , and are then swiftly transported away , " he said .
eu doing too little bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees are flooding the italian island of lampedusa kreissl-doerfler also accused the commission of doing too little to remind countries like italy of their responsibility " yes , the eu could do a lot , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .
so , while solidarity is now being called for by the southern countries , they were n't offering it before . "

in three rounds of inconclusive balloting on thursday , march 26 , amano , 61 , polled more votes than minty , 69 , but fell short of the 24 required under the agency 's rules .
on friday , the board resorted to two runoff , " yes , no or abstain " ballots for each candidate .
amano took 22 " yes " votes , 12 " no " and one abstention .
minty garnered 15 " yes " votes , 19 " no " with one abstention .
the nuclear watchdog has a 35-member board .
a new ballot is likely to be held in may , possibly with new candidates " the slate of candidates is considered to have been wiped clean , " ambassador taous feroukhi of algeria , chairman of the vienna-based governing board , told reporters .
bridging the rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-baradei had several spats with the bush administration over iran the inconclusive balloting can be attributed to the rich-poor divide that both amano and minty failed to bridge .
amano , japan 's permanent representative and ambassador , had drawn the backing of wealthy - mainly western - nuclear powers .
minty , pretoria 's long-time iaea governor , on the other hand , was supported primarily by developing countries .
" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .
" we were hopeful that those who advocated change and a relationship with the developing world based on trust and partnership would - in this important election process - have implemented these noble ideals , but sadly it appears as this has only remained as good intentions , " he said in a statement to governors .
a senior official from the japanese foreign ministry informed reporters that amano would run again .
amano has been criticized for lacking charisma , while some western nations perceive minty as too outspoken .
the iaea is tasked with detecting secret nuclear bomb programs as well as coordinating global cooperation in sharing energy for peaceful purposes .
egyptian nobel prize-winner el-baradei , who has been director of the iaea since 1997 , has had a difficult job recently , arguing with the bush administration over what he viewed as its warlike approach to resolving iran 's nuclear issue .
in turn , the us has accused him of overstepping his mandate as well as being too " soft " on iran .
iaea has new hope with obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant could be a concern for the new iaea director iaea officials are now hopeful that the us foreign policy under president barack obama will lead to smoother cooperation as well as an increase in the iaea 's budget , which el-baradei has referred to as " shoestring . "
obama has already signaled his readiness to talk without preconditions to iran and syria , which are both under investigation by the iaea .
new candidates who might enter the running to become the new iaea director include former mexican president ernesto zedillo and hungarian tibor toth , head of the un panel monitoring the nuclear-test-ban treaty -lrb- ctbto -rrb- .
new candidates have 28 days from monday to indicate their intentions .
analysts have said that third world members of the iaea favor a politically strong director general , while many europeans and the united states are more interested in having a technocrat run the agency . ls / tt / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally . "
addressing the stimulus packages some countries have introduced to address the economic downturn , lamy said , that these would aid economic growth by increasing demand , but some contained elements that favoured domestic goods and services .
preventing another ' great depression ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some national stimulus packages are affecting global growth the report , issued a week before the g20 meeting , highlights one of the key issues for the summit : how to prevent job-shielding trade restrictions that could turn the global recession into a long lasting depression leading to unrest and even war , as happened after wall street collapsed in 1929 .
while the wto has rules for its members on how high they can raise tariffs or boost subsidies , many countries keep their applied rates below the ceiling , giving them varying amounts of room to maneuver .
this means states could implement protectionist measures without actually violating their commitments .
a recent world bank report found that 17 of the g20 leading economies had implemented 47 protectionist measures since pledging not to at a summit last november .
in his report , a copy of which was obtained by the german press agency dpa , lamy called for the completion of the doha round of trade talks and said that , pending the conclusion of negotiations , countries should not use new trade restrictions and trade-distorting subsidies . mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
rutten 's backroom coaching team of mike bueskens , youri mulder and oliver reck will take control of the first team until a successor has been found .
former players bueskens and mulder had been caretaker coaches last season after the dismissal of mirko slomka .
rutten joined schalke at the beginning of the season on a contract until 2010 , but the team has never looked capable of mounting a bundesliga title challenge .
following sunday 's 2-1 home defeat by sv hamburg , schalke are lying eighth , 12 points behind leaders hertha berlin .
schalke also fell at the qualifying stages of the champions league , failed to make it out of the group stages of the uefa cup and were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the german cup .
before his removal from the post , rutten denied he was in talks with psv eindhoven and said he was continuing to focus on his job at schalke .
" i still have a lot of fun working here , " he said .

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .

" afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .
" our principle remains the same : there can be no security without reconstruction , and there can be reconstruction without security . jp / nda / tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .
" our principle remains the same : there can be no security without reconstruction , and there can be reconstruction without security . jp / nda / tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
rutten 's backroom coaching team of mike bueskens , youri mulder and oliver reck will take control of the first team until a successor has been found .
former players bueskens and mulder had been caretaker coaches last season after the dismissal of mirko slomka .
rutten joined schalke at the beginning of the season on a contract until 2010 , but the team has never looked capable of mounting a bundesliga title challenge .
following sunday 's 2-1 home defeat by sv hamburg , schalke are lying eighth , 12 points behind leaders hertha berlin .
schalke also fell at the qualifying stages of the champions league , failed to make it out of the group stages of the uefa cup and were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the german cup .
before his removal from the post , rutten denied he was in talks with psv eindhoven and said he was continuing to focus on his job at schalke .
" i still have a lot of fun working here , " he said .

in three rounds of inconclusive balloting on thursday , march 26 , amano , 61 , polled more votes than minty , 69 , but fell short of the 24 required under the agency 's rules .
on friday , the board resorted to two runoff , " yes , no or abstain " ballots for each candidate .
amano took 22 " yes " votes , 12 " no " and one abstention .
minty garnered 15 " yes " votes , 19 " no " with one abstention .
the nuclear watchdog has a 35-member board .
a new ballot is likely to be held in may , possibly with new candidates " the slate of candidates is considered to have been wiped clean , " ambassador taous feroukhi of algeria , chairman of the vienna-based governing board , told reporters .
bridging the rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-baradei had several spats with the bush administration over iran the inconclusive balloting can be attributed to the rich-poor divide that both amano and minty failed to bridge .
amano , japan 's permanent representative and ambassador , had drawn the backing of wealthy - mainly western - nuclear powers .
minty , pretoria 's long-time iaea governor , on the other hand , was supported primarily by developing countries .
" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .
" we were hopeful that those who advocated change and a relationship with the developing world based on trust and partnership would - in this important election process - have implemented these noble ideals , but sadly it appears as this has only remained as good intentions , " he said in a statement to governors .
a senior official from the japanese foreign ministry informed reporters that amano would run again .
amano has been criticized for lacking charisma , while some western nations perceive minty as too outspoken .

fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .
health experts however say there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . ls / jp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally . "
addressing the stimulus packages some countries have introduced to address the economic downturn , lamy said , that these would aid economic growth by increasing demand , but some contained elements that favoured domestic goods and services .
preventing another ' great depression ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some national stimulus packages are affecting global growth the report , issued a week before the g20 meeting , highlights one of the key issues for the summit : how to prevent job-shielding trade restrictions that could turn the global recession into a long lasting depression leading to unrest and even war , as happened after wall street collapsed in 1929 .
while the wto has rules for its members on how high they can raise tariffs or boost subsidies , many countries keep their applied rates below the ceiling , giving them varying amounts of room to maneuver .
this means states could implement protectionist measures without actually violating their commitments .
a recent world bank report found that 17 of the g20 leading economies had implemented 47 protectionist measures since pledging not to at a summit last november .
in his report , a copy of which was obtained by the german press agency dpa , lamy called for the completion of the doha round of trade talks and said that , pending the conclusion of negotiations , countries should not use new trade restrictions and trade-distorting subsidies . mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .

this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .

" echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .
" our principle remains the same : there can be no security without reconstruction , and there can be reconstruction without security . jp / nda / tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the controversy reignited after a top medical research journal added its voice to criticism of the pontiff . in an editorial , the lancet said the pontiff 's remarks were " wildly inaccurate " and could have " devastating consequences . "
the journal also questioned whether the pope 's comments were made out of ignorance or as a deliberate attempt to support catholic ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems the whole world is now listening when the pope speaks the lancet , one of the world 's leading medical research journals , was emphatic about the impact of the pontiff 's remarks and has called for the head of the catholic church to retract his remarks .
" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .
unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "
french bishop fuels controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is ravaging much of sub-saharan africa and its victims are both young and old monsignor andre fort , the bishop of the french city of orleans , fanned the flames of the dispute on friday by supporting the pontiff 's view of condoms .
fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .
health experts however say there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . ls / jp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "
french bishop fuels controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is ravaging much of sub-saharan africa and its victims are both young and old monsignor andre fort , the bishop of the french city of orleans , fanned the flames of the dispute on friday by supporting the pontiff 's view of condoms .
fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .
health experts however say there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . ls / jp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .
" our principle remains the same : there can be no security without reconstruction , and there can be reconstruction without security . jp / nda / tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally . "
addressing the stimulus packages some countries have introduced to address the economic downturn , lamy said , that these would aid economic growth by increasing demand , but some contained elements that favoured domestic goods and services .
preventing another ' great depression ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some national stimulus packages are affecting global growth the report , issued a week before the g20 meeting , highlights one of the key issues for the summit : how to prevent job-shielding trade restrictions that could turn the global recession into a long lasting depression leading to unrest and even war , as happened after wall street collapsed in 1929 .
while the wto has rules for its members on how high they can raise tariffs or boost subsidies , many countries keep their applied rates below the ceiling , giving them varying amounts of room to maneuver .
this means states could implement protectionist measures without actually violating their commitments .
a recent world bank report found that 17 of the g20 leading economies had implemented 47 protectionist measures since pledging not to at a summit last november .
in his report , a copy of which was obtained by the german press agency dpa , lamy called for the completion of the doha round of trade talks and said that , pending the conclusion of negotiations , countries should not use new trade restrictions and trade-distorting subsidies . mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "
separate incident the attack came less than 24 hours after a smaller greek-owned vessel was seized in the same area .
the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .
a greek merchant marine ministry spokesman said the chemical tanker 's russian captain and 18 filipino crew members were in good health and that the boat 's owner , lotus shipping , had begun negotiations with the pirates .
a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .
dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
the latest attacks occurred even though more than 20 warships from the eu , nato , china and russia patrol the area around the horn of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the european union play a more active role in cracking down on piracy ?
the eu launched its first-ever naval operation in december with six warships and three surveillance planes in the region .
but patrolling over a million square miles of ocean is a challenging task , and their presence seems to be little deterrent .
ransom-hunting somali pirates attacked more than 130 merchant ships in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , according to the international maritime bureau .
in the wake of the incidents , greece , which is home to the biggest commercial fleet in the world , called on the eu " to play a more active role " in cracking down on piracy .
merchant marine minister anastasis papaligouras said the eu should " expand the rules of engagement and the area patrolled by the european naval force . "
he also called on shipping companies " to inform with total accuracy and in good time the competent services " about the movements of boats . jp / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a previous grouping of hitler paintings , sold two years ago , fetched twice their estimated value . among the 13 pieces to be sold on april 23 at the mullock 's auction house in shropshire , england , is a self-portrait painted by hitler when he was a young struggling artist living in vienna .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before becoming leader of nazi germany , hitler applied , and failed to get into , art school the watercolor shows hitler sitting pensively on a stone bridge , wearing a brown suit .
his face lacks a nose and mouth , as well as the trademark square moustache .
two years ago , 21 paintings attributed to hitler were sold for 118,000 pounds -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- , or more than twice the pre-sale estimate , by an auction house in cornwall .
but some art experts voiced doubts about the paintings ' authenticity .
richard westwood-brookes , a historical documents expert who will be holding the sale for mullocks , told reuters news agency that he 's seen quite a bit of hitler art and that all the subjects tend to be the same , explaining that hitler liked to paint pictures of flowers , especially roses , and romantic landscapes with cottages .
buyer beware those doing the bidding in next month 's auction will most likely be history buffs interested in adolf hitler as a historic figure .
the paintings are mostly watercolors and signed with hitler 's initials .
" they 're not exactly the greatest pictures in the world , " westwood-brookes said , adding they could fetch between 400 and 1,000 pounds .
westwood-brookes said an austrian expert had issued certificates of authenticity for the pictures , which once belonged to a british soldier stationed in essen , germany , in 1945 .
the authenticity of hitler 's work has long been a bone of contention .
in 1983 , a british historian was taken in by diaries purportedly written by hitler that became a sensation before turning out to be forgeries . mrm / tt / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "
separate incident the attack came less than 24 hours after a smaller greek-owned vessel was seized in the same area .
the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .
a greek merchant marine ministry spokesman said the chemical tanker 's russian captain and 18 filipino crew members were in good health and that the boat 's owner , lotus shipping , had begun negotiations with the pirates .
a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .
dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
the latest attacks occurred even though more than 20 warships from the eu , nato , china and russia patrol the area around the horn of africa .

the eu launched its first-ever naval operation in december with six warships and three surveillance planes in the region .

ransom-hunting somali pirates attacked more than 130 merchant ships in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , according to the international maritime bureau .
in the wake of the incidents , greece , which is home to the biggest commercial fleet in the world , called on the eu " to play a more active role " in cracking down on piracy .
merchant marine minister anastasis papaligouras said the eu should " expand the rules of engagement and the area patrolled by the european naval force . "

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "
separate incident the attack came less than 24 hours after a smaller greek-owned vessel was seized in the same area .
the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .
a greek merchant marine ministry spokesman said the chemical tanker 's russian captain and 18 filipino crew members were in good health and that the boat 's owner , lotus shipping , had begun negotiations with the pirates .
a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .
dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
the latest attacks occurred even though more than 20 warships from the eu , nato , china and russia patrol the area around the horn of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the european union play a more active role in cracking down on piracy ?
the eu launched its first-ever naval operation in december with six warships and three surveillance planes in the region .
but patrolling over a million square miles of ocean is a challenging task , and their presence seems to be little deterrent .
ransom-hunting somali pirates attacked more than 130 merchant ships in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , according to the international maritime bureau .
in the wake of the incidents , greece , which is home to the biggest commercial fleet in the world , called on the eu " to play a more active role " in cracking down on piracy .
merchant marine minister anastasis papaligouras said the eu should " expand the rules of engagement and the area patrolled by the european naval force . "

a previous grouping of hitler paintings , sold two years ago , fetched twice their estimated value . among the 13 pieces to be sold on april 23 at the mullock 's auction house in shropshire , england , is a self-portrait painted by hitler when he was a young struggling artist living in vienna .

two years ago , 21 paintings attributed to hitler were sold for 118,000 pounds -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- , or more than twice the pre-sale estimate , by an auction house in cornwall .
but some art experts voiced doubts about the paintings ' authenticity .
richard westwood-brookes , a historical documents expert who will be holding the sale for mullocks , told reuters news agency that he 's seen quite a bit of hitler art and that all the subjects tend to be the same , explaining that hitler liked to paint pictures of flowers , especially roses , and romantic landscapes with cottages .
buyer beware those doing the bidding in next month 's auction will most likely be history buffs interested in adolf hitler as a historic figure .
the paintings are mostly watercolors and signed with hitler 's initials .
" they 're not exactly the greatest pictures in the world , " westwood-brookes said , adding they could fetch between 400 and 1,000 pounds .
westwood-brookes said an austrian expert had issued certificates of authenticity for the pictures , which once belonged to a british soldier stationed in essen , germany , in 1945 .
the authenticity of hitler 's work has long been a bone of contention .
in 1983 , a british historian was taken in by diaries purportedly written by hitler that became a sensation before turning out to be forgeries . mrm / tt / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the controversy reignited after a top medical research journal added its voice to criticism of the pontiff . in an editorial , the lancet said the pontiff 's remarks were " wildly inaccurate " and could have " devastating consequences . "
the journal also questioned whether the pope 's comments were made out of ignorance or as a deliberate attempt to support catholic ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems the whole world is now listening when the pope speaks the lancet , one of the world 's leading medical research journals , was emphatic about the impact of the pontiff 's remarks and has called for the head of the catholic church to retract his remarks .
" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .
unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "

fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .

the controversy reignited after a top medical research journal added its voice to criticism of the pontiff . in an editorial , the lancet said the pontiff 's remarks were " wildly inaccurate " and could have " devastating consequences . "
the journal also questioned whether the pope 's comments were made out of ignorance or as a deliberate attempt to support catholic ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems the whole world is now listening when the pope speaks the lancet , one of the world 's leading medical research journals , was emphatic about the impact of the pontiff 's remarks and has called for the head of the catholic church to retract his remarks .
" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .

fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "

minty garnered 15 " yes " votes , 19 " no " with one abstention .

" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .

in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .

in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .
" the policy of the commission in this situation is to demonstrate solidarity so that we can help refugees and the eu countries that are trying to handle the situation , " said laitenberger .
solidarity in accepting refugees is one thing .
but german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble already summarized in 2005 how he envisioned eu member states solving the refugee problem .
" in addition to more efficient border controls that they need , they must fight the causes and cooperate with the neighboring states , " he said .
eu has responsibility for refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has put the emphasis on preventing refugees from making it to europe the eu has been trying to prevent streams of refuges this way for several years .
but critics say that the eu 's entire refugee policy is too defensive .
" better protection and more access to lasting solutions in the refugees ' country of origin is a respectable goal " said antónio guterres , the un high commissioner for refugee matters back in 2006 .
" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .
europe is a continent of asylum and must remain this way . "
european parliamentarian wolfgang kreissl-doerfler visited lampedusa four years ago with a parliamentarian group .
he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .
yet these people sometimes do n't even get a chance to apply , particularly in greece and italy . "
" they are not informed about their right to asylum .
they are immediately put in custody , pending deportation , and are then swiftly transported away , " he said .
eu doing too little bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees are flooding the italian island of lampedusa kreissl-doerfler also accused the commission of doing too little to remind countries like italy of their responsibility " yes , the eu could do a lot , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .
so , while solidarity is now being called for by the southern countries , they were n't offering it before . "

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally .

while the wto has rules for its members on how high they can raise tariffs or boost subsidies , many countries keep their applied rates below the ceiling , giving them varying amounts of room to maneuver .
this means states could implement protectionist measures without actually violating their commitments .
a recent world bank report found that 17 of the g20 leading economies had implemented 47 protectionist measures since pledging not to at a summit last november .
in his report , a copy of which was obtained by the german press agency dpa , lamy called for the completion of the doha round of trade talks and said that , pending the conclusion of negotiations , countries should not use new trade restrictions and trade-distorting subsidies . mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally . "
addressing the stimulus packages some countries have introduced to address the economic downturn , lamy said , that these would aid economic growth by increasing demand , but some contained elements that favoured domestic goods and services .
preventing another ' great depression ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some national stimulus packages are affecting global growth the report , issued a week before the g20 meeting , highlights one of the key issues for the summit : how to prevent job-shielding trade restrictions that could turn the global recession into a long lasting depression leading to unrest and even war , as happened after wall street collapsed in 1929 .
while the wto has rules for its members on how high they can raise tariffs or boost subsidies , many countries keep their applied rates below the ceiling , giving them varying amounts of room to maneuver .
this means states could implement protectionist measures without actually violating their commitments .
a recent world bank report found that 17 of the g20 leading economies had implemented 47 protectionist measures since pledging not to at a summit last november .

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries .

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security .

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .

in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .
" the policy of the commission in this situation is to demonstrate solidarity so that we can help refugees and the eu countries that are trying to handle the situation , " said laitenberger .
solidarity in accepting refugees is one thing .
but german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble already summarized in 2005 how he envisioned eu member states solving the refugee problem .
" in addition to more efficient border controls that they need , they must fight the causes and cooperate with the neighboring states , " he said .
eu has responsibility for refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has put the emphasis on preventing refugees from making it to europe the eu has been trying to prevent streams of refuges this way for several years .
but critics say that the eu 's entire refugee policy is too defensive .
" better protection and more access to lasting solutions in the refugees ' country of origin is a respectable goal " said antónio guterres , the un high commissioner for refugee matters back in 2006 .
" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .
europe is a continent of asylum and must remain this way . "
european parliamentarian wolfgang kreissl-doerfler visited lampedusa four years ago with a parliamentarian group .
he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .
yet these people sometimes do n't even get a chance to apply , particularly in greece and italy . "
" they are not informed about their right to asylum .
they are immediately put in custody , pending deportation , and are then swiftly transported away , " he said .
eu doing too little bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees are flooding the italian island of lampedusa kreissl-doerfler also accused the commission of doing too little to remind countries like italy of their responsibility " yes , the eu could do a lot , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .
so , while solidarity is now being called for by the southern countries , they were n't offering it before . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 27.03.2009 condom controversy continues as top medical journal slams pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no end in sight yet for the condom controversy on a recent tour of africa , pope benedict xvi suggested condoms are unhelpful in the fight against aids .
the controversy reignited after a top medical research journal added its voice to criticism of the pontiff . in an editorial , the lancet said the pontiff 's remarks were " wildly inaccurate " and could have " devastating consequences . "
the journal also questioned whether the pope 's comments were made out of ignorance or as a deliberate attempt to support catholic ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems the whole world is now listening when the pope speaks the lancet , one of the world 's leading medical research journals , was emphatic about the impact of the pontiff 's remarks and has called for the head of the catholic church to retract his remarks .
" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .
unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "
french bishop fuels controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is ravaging much of sub-saharan africa and its victims are both young and old monsignor andre fort , the bishop of the french city of orleans , fanned the flames of the dispute on friday by supporting the pontiff 's view of condoms .
fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .
health experts however say there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . ls / jp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in three rounds of inconclusive balloting on thursday , march 26 , amano , 61 , polled more votes than minty , 69 , but fell short of the 24 required under the agency 's rules .
on friday , the board resorted to two runoff , " yes , no or abstain " ballots for each candidate .
amano took 22 " yes " votes , 12 " no " and one abstention .
minty garnered 15 " yes " votes , 19 " no " with one abstention .
the nuclear watchdog has a 35-member board .
a new ballot is likely to be held in may , possibly with new candidates " the slate of candidates is considered to have been wiped clean , " ambassador taous feroukhi of algeria , chairman of the vienna-based governing board , told reporters .
bridging the rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-baradei had several spats with the bush administration over iran the inconclusive balloting can be attributed to the rich-poor divide that both amano and minty failed to bridge .
amano , japan 's permanent representative and ambassador , had drawn the backing of wealthy - mainly western - nuclear powers .
minty , pretoria 's long-time iaea governor , on the other hand , was supported primarily by developing countries .
" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .
" we were hopeful that those who advocated change and a relationship with the developing world based on trust and partnership would - in this important election process - have implemented these noble ideals , but sadly it appears as this has only remained as good intentions , " he said in a statement to governors .
a senior official from the japanese foreign ministry informed reporters that amano would run again .
amano has been criticized for lacking charisma , while some western nations perceive minty as too outspoken .
the iaea is tasked with detecting secret nuclear bomb programs as well as coordinating global cooperation in sharing energy for peaceful purposes .
egyptian nobel prize-winner el-baradei , who has been director of the iaea since 1997 , has had a difficult job recently , arguing with the bush administration over what he viewed as its warlike approach to resolving iran 's nuclear issue .
in turn , the us has accused him of overstepping his mandate as well as being too " soft " on iran .
iaea has new hope with obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant could be a concern for the new iaea director iaea officials are now hopeful that the us foreign policy under president barack obama will lead to smoother cooperation as well as an increase in the iaea 's budget , which el-baradei has referred to as " shoestring . "
obama has already signaled his readiness to talk without preconditions to iran and syria , which are both under investigation by the iaea .
new candidates who might enter the running to become the new iaea director include former mexican president ernesto zedillo and hungarian tibor toth , head of the un panel monitoring the nuclear-test-ban treaty -lrb- ctbto -rrb- .
new candidates have 28 days from monday to indicate their intentions .
analysts have said that third world members of the iaea favor a politically strong director general , while many europeans and the united states are more interested in having a technocrat run the agency . ls / tt / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "
separate incident the attack came less than 24 hours after a smaller greek-owned vessel was seized in the same area .
the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .
a greek merchant marine ministry spokesman said the chemical tanker 's russian captain and 18 filipino crew members were in good health and that the boat 's owner , lotus shipping , had begun negotiations with the pirates .
a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .
dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
the latest attacks occurred even though more than 20 warships from the eu , nato , china and russia patrol the area around the horn of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the european union play a more active role in cracking down on piracy ?
the eu launched its first-ever naval operation in december with six warships and three surveillance planes in the region .
but patrolling over a million square miles of ocean is a challenging task , and their presence seems to be little deterrent .
ransom-hunting somali pirates attacked more than 130 merchant ships in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , according to the international maritime bureau .
in the wake of the incidents , greece , which is home to the biggest commercial fleet in the world , called on the eu " to play a more active role " in cracking down on piracy .
merchant marine minister anastasis papaligouras said the eu should " expand the rules of engagement and the area patrolled by the european naval force . "
he also called on shipping companies " to inform with total accuracy and in good time the competent services " about the movements of boats . jp / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a greek merchant marine ministry spokesman said the chemical tanker 's russian captain and 18 filipino crew members were in good health and that the boat 's owner , lotus shipping , had begun negotiations with the pirates .
a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .
dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
the latest attacks occurred even though more than 20 warships from the eu , nato , china and russia patrol the area around the horn of africa .

the eu launched its first-ever naval operation in december with six warships and three surveillance planes in the region .

in the wake of the incidents , greece , which is home to the biggest commercial fleet in the world , called on the eu " to play a more active role " in cracking down on piracy .
merchant marine minister anastasis papaligouras said the eu should " expand the rules of engagement and the area patrolled by the european naval force . "

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 27.03.2009 schalke and coach rutten part company after emotional meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rutten pays the price for schalke 's run of tepid form schalke 04 parted company with coach fred rutten thursday , just hours after the dutchman said he had been told by club general secretary peter peters that he would not be retained next season . the 46-year-old rutten was informed of the decision after a crisis meeting with supervisory board chairman josef schnusenberg , which the club described as " very practical and also at times emotional . "
rutten 's backroom coaching team of mike bueskens , youri mulder and oliver reck will take control of the first team until a successor has been found .
former players bueskens and mulder had been caretaker coaches last season after the dismissal of mirko slomka .
rutten joined schalke at the beginning of the season on a contract until 2010 , but the team has never looked capable of mounting a bundesliga title challenge .
following sunday 's 2-1 home defeat by sv hamburg , schalke are lying eighth , 12 points behind leaders hertha berlin .
schalke also fell at the qualifying stages of the champions league , failed to make it out of the group stages of the uefa cup and were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the german cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 27.03.2009 wto chief warns against rising protectionism in fight against crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy warns that protectionism could lead to another great depression many g20 nations have imposed protectionist measures , leading the head of the wto to warn that if something is n't done , global commerce could be put at risk , which could ultimately lead to another great depression . as the global credit crunch continues , governments around the world are facing immense pressure to implement protectionist measures in order to keep jobs at home , putting international commerce at risk , warns the head of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- .
wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally . "
addressing the stimulus packages some countries have introduced to address the economic downturn , lamy said , that these would aid economic growth by increasing demand , but some contained elements that favoured domestic goods and services .
preventing another ' great depression ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some national stimulus packages are affecting global growth the report , issued a week before the g20 meeting , highlights one of the key issues for the summit : how to prevent job-shielding trade restrictions that could turn the global recession into a long lasting depression leading to unrest and even war , as happened after wall street collapsed in 1929 .
while the wto has rules for its members on how high they can raise tariffs or boost subsidies , many countries keep their applied rates below the ceiling , giving them varying amounts of room to maneuver .

in three rounds of inconclusive balloting on thursday , march 26 , amano , 61 , polled more votes than minty , 69 , but fell short of the 24 required under the agency 's rules .
on friday , the board resorted to two runoff , " yes , no or abstain " ballots for each candidate .
amano took 22 " yes " votes , 12 " no " and one abstention .
minty garnered 15 " yes " votes , 19 " no " with one abstention .
the nuclear watchdog has a 35-member board .
a new ballot is likely to be held in may , possibly with new candidates " the slate of candidates is considered to have been wiped clean , " ambassador taous feroukhi of algeria , chairman of the vienna-based governing board , told reporters .
bridging the rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-baradei had several spats with the bush administration over iran the inconclusive balloting can be attributed to the rich-poor divide that both amano and minty failed to bridge .
amano , japan 's permanent representative and ambassador , had drawn the backing of wealthy - mainly western - nuclear powers .
minty , pretoria 's long-time iaea governor , on the other hand , was supported primarily by developing countries .
" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .
" we were hopeful that those who advocated change and a relationship with the developing world based on trust and partnership would - in this important election process - have implemented these noble ideals , but sadly it appears as this has only remained as good intentions , " he said in a statement to governors .
a senior official from the japanese foreign ministry informed reporters that amano would run again .
amano has been criticized for lacking charisma , while some western nations perceive minty as too outspoken .
the iaea is tasked with detecting secret nuclear bomb programs as well as coordinating global cooperation in sharing energy for peaceful purposes .
egyptian nobel prize-winner el-baradei , who has been director of the iaea since 1997 , has had a difficult job recently , arguing with the bush administration over what he viewed as its warlike approach to resolving iran 's nuclear issue .
in turn , the us has accused him of overstepping his mandate as well as being too " soft " on iran .
iaea has new hope with obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant could be a concern for the new iaea director iaea officials are now hopeful that the us foreign policy under president barack obama will lead to smoother cooperation as well as an increase in the iaea 's budget , which el-baradei has referred to as " shoestring . "
obama has already signaled his readiness to talk without preconditions to iran and syria , which are both under investigation by the iaea .
new candidates who might enter the running to become the new iaea director include former mexican president ernesto zedillo and hungarian tibor toth , head of the un panel monitoring the nuclear-test-ban treaty -lrb- ctbto -rrb- .
new candidates have 28 days from monday to indicate their intentions .
analysts have said that third world members of the iaea favor a politically strong director general , while many europeans and the united states are more interested in having a technocrat run the agency . ls / tt / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .
" the policy of the commission in this situation is to demonstrate solidarity so that we can help refugees and the eu countries that are trying to handle the situation , " said laitenberger .
solidarity in accepting refugees is one thing .

" better protection and more access to lasting solutions in the refugees ' country of origin is a respectable goal " said antónio guterres , the un high commissioner for refugee matters back in 2006 .
" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .
europe is a continent of asylum and must remain this way . "

he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .
yet these people sometimes do n't even get a chance to apply , particularly in greece and italy . "
" they are not informed about their right to asylum .
they are immediately put in custody , pending deportation , and are then swiftly transported away , " he said .
eu doing too little bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees are flooding the italian island of lampedusa kreissl-doerfler also accused the commission of doing too little to remind countries like italy of their responsibility " yes , the eu could do a lot , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .

european parliamentarian wolfgang kreissl-doerfler visited lampedusa four years ago with a parliamentarian group .
he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .
yet these people sometimes do n't even get a chance to apply , particularly in greece and italy . "
" they are not informed about their right to asylum .
they are immediately put in custody , pending deportation , and are then swiftly transported away , " he said .
eu doing too little bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees are flooding the italian island of lampedusa kreissl-doerfler also accused the commission of doing too little to remind countries like italy of their responsibility " yes , the eu could do a lot , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .
so , while solidarity is now being called for by the southern countries , they were n't offering it before . "

dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
the latest attacks occurred even though more than 20 warships from the eu , nato , china and russia patrol the area around the horn of africa .

the eu launched its first-ever naval operation in december with six warships and three surveillance planes in the region .
but patrolling over a million square miles of ocean is a challenging task , and their presence seems to be little deterrent .
ransom-hunting somali pirates attacked more than 130 merchant ships in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , according to the international maritime bureau .
in the wake of the incidents , greece , which is home to the biggest commercial fleet in the world , called on the eu " to play a more active role " in cracking down on piracy .
merchant marine minister anastasis papaligouras said the eu should " expand the rules of engagement and the area patrolled by the european naval force . "
he also called on shipping companies " to inform with total accuracy and in good time the competent services " about the movements of boats . jp / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "
separate incident the attack came less than 24 hours after a smaller greek-owned vessel was seized in the same area .
the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .

minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .

in three rounds of inconclusive balloting on thursday , march 26 , amano , 61 , polled more votes than minty , 69 , but fell short of the 24 required under the agency 's rules .
on friday , the board resorted to two runoff , " yes , no or abstain " ballots for each candidate .
amano took 22 " yes " votes , 12 " no " and one abstention .
minty garnered 15 " yes " votes , 19 " no " with one abstention .
the nuclear watchdog has a 35-member board .

amano , japan 's permanent representative and ambassador , had drawn the backing of wealthy - mainly western - nuclear powers .
minty , pretoria 's long-time iaea governor , on the other hand , was supported primarily by developing countries .
" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .
" we were hopeful that those who advocated change and a relationship with the developing world based on trust and partnership would - in this important election process - have implemented these noble ideals , but sadly it appears as this has only remained as good intentions , " he said in a statement to governors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.03.2009 eu refugee policy : right to asylum or prison mentality ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs a unified policy for its streams of refugees despite overcrowded refugee camps on islands such as lampedusa and malta - where thousands of africans have tried to set their foot on european soil illegally - the eu is still lacking a joint asylum policy . when eu justice commissioner jacques barrot recently visited refugee camps on lampedusa and malta , he was horrified by the conditions of the camps .
in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .
" the policy of the commission in this situation is to demonstrate solidarity so that we can help refugees and the eu countries that are trying to handle the situation , " said laitenberger .
solidarity in accepting refugees is one thing .
but german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble already summarized in 2005 how he envisioned eu member states solving the refugee problem .
" in addition to more efficient border controls that they need , they must fight the causes and cooperate with the neighboring states , " he said .
eu has responsibility for refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has put the emphasis on preventing refugees from making it to europe the eu has been trying to prevent streams of refuges this way for several years .
but critics say that the eu 's entire refugee policy is too defensive .
" better protection and more access to lasting solutions in the refugees ' country of origin is a respectable goal " said antónio guterres , the un high commissioner for refugee matters back in 2006 .
" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .
europe is a continent of asylum and must remain this way . "
european parliamentarian wolfgang kreissl-doerfler visited lampedusa four years ago with a parliamentarian group .
he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .
yet these people sometimes do n't even get a chance to apply , particularly in greece and italy . "

" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .
so , while solidarity is now being called for by the southern countries , they were n't offering it before . "

the controversy reignited after a top medical research journal added its voice to criticism of the pontiff . in an editorial , the lancet said the pontiff 's remarks were " wildly inaccurate " and could have " devastating consequences . "
the journal also questioned whether the pope 's comments were made out of ignorance or as a deliberate attempt to support catholic ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems the whole world is now listening when the pope speaks the lancet , one of the world 's leading medical research journals , was emphatic about the impact of the pontiff 's remarks and has called for the head of the catholic church to retract his remarks .
" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .
unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "
french bishop fuels controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is ravaging much of sub-saharan africa and its victims are both young and old monsignor andre fort , the bishop of the french city of orleans , fanned the flames of the dispute on friday by supporting the pontiff 's view of condoms .
fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .
health experts however say there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . ls / jp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .
unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "
french bishop fuels controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is ravaging much of sub-saharan africa and its victims are both young and old monsignor andre fort , the bishop of the french city of orleans , fanned the flames of the dispute on friday by supporting the pontiff 's view of condoms .
fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .
health experts however say there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . ls / jp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .
" the policy of the commission in this situation is to demonstrate solidarity so that we can help refugees and the eu countries that are trying to handle the situation , " said laitenberger .
solidarity in accepting refugees is one thing .
but german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble already summarized in 2005 how he envisioned eu member states solving the refugee problem .
" in addition to more efficient border controls that they need , they must fight the causes and cooperate with the neighboring states , " he said .
eu has responsibility for refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has put the emphasis on preventing refugees from making it to europe the eu has been trying to prevent streams of refuges this way for several years .
but critics say that the eu 's entire refugee policy is too defensive .
" better protection and more access to lasting solutions in the refugees ' country of origin is a respectable goal " said antónio guterres , the un high commissioner for refugee matters back in 2006 .
" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .
europe is a continent of asylum and must remain this way . "
european parliamentarian wolfgang kreissl-doerfler visited lampedusa four years ago with a parliamentarian group .
he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .
yet these people sometimes do n't even get a chance to apply , particularly in greece and italy . "
" they are not informed about their right to asylum .
they are immediately put in custody , pending deportation , and are then swiftly transported away , " he said .
eu doing too little bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees are flooding the italian island of lampedusa kreissl-doerfler also accused the commission of doing too little to remind countries like italy of their responsibility " yes , the eu could do a lot , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .
so , while solidarity is now being called for by the southern countries , they were n't offering it before . "

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally .

a previous grouping of hitler paintings , sold two years ago , fetched twice their estimated value . among the 13 pieces to be sold on april 23 at the mullock 's auction house in shropshire , england , is a self-portrait painted by hitler when he was a young struggling artist living in vienna .

a previous grouping of hitler paintings , sold two years ago , fetched twice their estimated value . among the 13 pieces to be sold on april 23 at the mullock 's auction house in shropshire , england , is a self-portrait painted by hitler when he was a young struggling artist living in vienna .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before becoming leader of nazi germany , hitler applied , and failed to get into , art school the watercolor shows hitler sitting pensively on a stone bridge , wearing a brown suit .
his face lacks a nose and mouth , as well as the trademark square moustache .
two years ago , 21 paintings attributed to hitler were sold for 118,000 pounds -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- , or more than twice the pre-sale estimate , by an auction house in cornwall .
but some art experts voiced doubts about the paintings ' authenticity .
richard westwood-brookes , a historical documents expert who will be holding the sale for mullocks , told reuters news agency that he 's seen quite a bit of hitler art and that all the subjects tend to be the same , explaining that hitler liked to paint pictures of flowers , especially roses , and romantic landscapes with cottages .
buyer beware those doing the bidding in next month 's auction will most likely be history buffs interested in adolf hitler as a historic figure .
the paintings are mostly watercolors and signed with hitler 's initials .
" they 're not exactly the greatest pictures in the world , " westwood-brookes said , adding they could fetch between 400 and 1,000 pounds .
westwood-brookes said an austrian expert had issued certificates of authenticity for the pictures , which once belonged to a british soldier stationed in essen , germany , in 1945 .

"
rutten 's backroom coaching team of mike bueskens , youri mulder and oliver reck will take control of the first team until a successor has been found .
former players bueskens and mulder had been caretaker coaches last season after the dismissal of mirko slomka .
rutten joined schalke at the beginning of the season on a contract until 2010 , but the team has never looked capable of mounting a bundesliga title challenge .
following sunday 's 2-1 home defeat by sv hamburg , schalke are lying eighth , 12 points behind leaders hertha berlin .
schalke also fell at the qualifying stages of the champions league , failed to make it out of the group stages of the uefa cup and were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the german cup .
before his removal from the post , rutten denied he was in talks with psv eindhoven and said he was continuing to focus on his job at schalke .
" i still have a lot of fun working here , " he said .
turmoil at the top schalke are currently looking for a general manager after dismissing andreas mueller earlier this month .

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally . "
addressing the stimulus packages some countries have introduced to address the economic downturn , lamy said , that these would aid economic growth by increasing demand , but some contained elements that favoured domestic goods and services .
preventing another ' great depression ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some national stimulus packages are affecting global growth the report , issued a week before the g20 meeting , highlights one of the key issues for the summit : how to prevent job-shielding trade restrictions that could turn the global recession into a long lasting depression leading to unrest and even war , as happened after wall street collapsed in 1929 .
while the wto has rules for its members on how high they can raise tariffs or boost subsidies , many countries keep their applied rates below the ceiling , giving them varying amounts of room to maneuver .
this means states could implement protectionist measures without actually violating their commitments .
a recent world bank report found that 17 of the g20 leading economies had implemented 47 protectionist measures since pledging not to at a summit last november .
in his report , a copy of which was obtained by the german press agency dpa , lamy called for the completion of the doha round of trade talks and said that , pending the conclusion of negotiations , countries should not use new trade restrictions and trade-distorting subsidies . mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .
" our principle remains the same : there can be no security without reconstruction , and there can be reconstruction without security . jp / nda / tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu has responsibility for refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has put the emphasis on preventing refugees from making it to europe the eu has been trying to prevent streams of refuges this way for several years .
but critics say that the eu 's entire refugee policy is too defensive .
" better protection and more access to lasting solutions in the refugees ' country of origin is a respectable goal " said antónio guterres , the un high commissioner for refugee matters back in 2006 .
" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .
europe is a continent of asylum and must remain this way . "
european parliamentarian wolfgang kreissl-doerfler visited lampedusa four years ago with a parliamentarian group .
he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .
yet these people sometimes do n't even get a chance to apply , particularly in greece and italy . "
" they are not informed about their right to asylum .
they are immediately put in custody , pending deportation , and are then swiftly transported away , " he said .
eu doing too little bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees are flooding the italian island of lampedusa kreissl-doerfler also accused the commission of doing too little to remind countries like italy of their responsibility " yes , the eu could do a lot , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .
so , while solidarity is now being called for by the southern countries , they were n't offering it before . "

the controversy reignited after a top medical research journal added its voice to criticism of the pontiff . in an editorial , the lancet said the pontiff 's remarks were " wildly inaccurate " and could have " devastating consequences . "
the journal also questioned whether the pope 's comments were made out of ignorance or as a deliberate attempt to support catholic ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems the whole world is now listening when the pope speaks the lancet , one of the world 's leading medical research journals , was emphatic about the impact of the pontiff 's remarks and has called for the head of the catholic church to retract his remarks .
" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .
unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "
french bishop fuels controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is ravaging much of sub-saharan africa and its victims are both young and old monsignor andre fort , the bishop of the french city of orleans , fanned the flames of the dispute on friday by supporting the pontiff 's view of condoms .
fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .

in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .

a previous grouping of hitler paintings , sold two years ago , fetched twice their estimated value . among the 13 pieces to be sold on april 23 at the mullock 's auction house in shropshire , england , is a self-portrait painted by hitler when he was a young struggling artist living in vienna .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before becoming leader of nazi germany , hitler applied , and failed to get into , art school the watercolor shows hitler sitting pensively on a stone bridge , wearing a brown suit .
his face lacks a nose and mouth , as well as the trademark square moustache .
two years ago , 21 paintings attributed to hitler were sold for 118,000 pounds -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- , or more than twice the pre-sale estimate , by an auction house in cornwall .
but some art experts voiced doubts about the paintings ' authenticity .
richard westwood-brookes , a historical documents expert who will be holding the sale for mullocks , told reuters news agency that he 's seen quite a bit of hitler art and that all the subjects tend to be the same , explaining that hitler liked to paint pictures of flowers , especially roses , and romantic landscapes with cottages .
buyer beware those doing the bidding in next month 's auction will most likely be history buffs interested in adolf hitler as a historic figure .
the paintings are mostly watercolors and signed with hitler 's initials .
" they 're not exactly the greatest pictures in the world , " westwood-brookes said , adding they could fetch between 400 and 1,000 pounds .
westwood-brookes said an austrian expert had issued certificates of authenticity for the pictures , which once belonged to a british soldier stationed in essen , germany , in 1945 .
the authenticity of hitler 's work has long been a bone of contention .
in 1983 , a british historian was taken in by diaries purportedly written by hitler that became a sensation before turning out to be forgeries . mrm / tt / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .
" our principle remains the same : there can be no security without reconstruction , and there can be reconstruction without security . jp / nda / tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .
" our principle remains the same : there can be no security without reconstruction , and there can be reconstruction without security . jp / nda / tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .
" the policy of the commission in this situation is to demonstrate solidarity so that we can help refugees and the eu countries that are trying to handle the situation , " said laitenberger .
solidarity in accepting refugees is one thing .

" in addition to more efficient border controls that they need , they must fight the causes and cooperate with the neighboring states , " he said .

" better protection and more access to lasting solutions in the refugees ' country of origin is a respectable goal " said antónio guterres , the un high commissioner for refugee matters back in 2006 .
" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .

" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security .

these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan .

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "
separate incident the attack came less than 24 hours after a smaller greek-owned vessel was seized in the same area .
the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .
a greek merchant marine ministry spokesman said the chemical tanker 's russian captain and 18 filipino crew members were in good health and that the boat 's owner , lotus shipping , had begun negotiations with the pirates .
a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .
dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
the latest attacks occurred even though more than 20 warships from the eu , nato , china and russia patrol the area around the horn of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the european union play a more active role in cracking down on piracy ?
the eu launched its first-ever naval operation in december with six warships and three surveillance planes in the region .
but patrolling over a million square miles of ocean is a challenging task , and their presence seems to be little deterrent .
ransom-hunting somali pirates attacked more than 130 merchant ships in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , according to the international maritime bureau .
in the wake of the incidents , greece , which is home to the biggest commercial fleet in the world , called on the eu " to play a more active role " in cracking down on piracy .
merchant marine minister anastasis papaligouras said the eu should " expand the rules of engagement and the area patrolled by the european naval force . "
he also called on shipping companies " to inform with total accuracy and in good time the competent services " about the movements of boats . jp / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally . "
addressing the stimulus packages some countries have introduced to address the economic downturn , lamy said , that these would aid economic growth by increasing demand , but some contained elements that favoured domestic goods and services .
preventing another ' great depression ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some national stimulus packages are affecting global growth the report , issued a week before the g20 meeting , highlights one of the key issues for the summit : how to prevent job-shielding trade restrictions that could turn the global recession into a long lasting depression leading to unrest and even war , as happened after wall street collapsed in 1929 .
while the wto has rules for its members on how high they can raise tariffs or boost subsidies , many countries keep their applied rates below the ceiling , giving them varying amounts of room to maneuver .
this means states could implement protectionist measures without actually violating their commitments .
a recent world bank report found that 17 of the g20 leading economies had implemented 47 protectionist measures since pledging not to at a summit last november .
in his report , a copy of which was obtained by the german press agency dpa , lamy called for the completion of the doha round of trade talks and said that , pending the conclusion of negotiations , countries should not use new trade restrictions and trade-distorting subsidies . mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.03.2009 eu refugee policy : right to asylum or prison mentality ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu needs a unified policy for its streams of refugees despite overcrowded refugee camps on islands such as lampedusa and malta - where thousands of africans have tried to set their foot on european soil illegally - the eu is still lacking a joint asylum policy . when eu justice commissioner jacques barrot recently visited refugee camps on lampedusa and malta , he was horrified by the conditions of the camps .
in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .
" the policy of the commission in this situation is to demonstrate solidarity so that we can help refugees and the eu countries that are trying to handle the situation , " said laitenberger .
solidarity in accepting refugees is one thing .
but german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble already summarized in 2005 how he envisioned eu member states solving the refugee problem .
" in addition to more efficient border controls that they need , they must fight the causes and cooperate with the neighboring states , " he said .
eu has responsibility for refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has put the emphasis on preventing refugees from making it to europe the eu has been trying to prevent streams of refuges this way for several years .
but critics say that the eu 's entire refugee policy is too defensive .
" better protection and more access to lasting solutions in the refugees ' country of origin is a respectable goal " said antónio guterres , the un high commissioner for refugee matters back in 2006 .
" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .
europe is a continent of asylum and must remain this way . "
european parliamentarian wolfgang kreissl-doerfler visited lampedusa four years ago with a parliamentarian group .
he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .
yet these people sometimes do n't even get a chance to apply , particularly in greece and italy . "
" they are not informed about their right to asylum .
they are immediately put in custody , pending deportation , and are then swiftly transported away , " he said .
eu doing too little bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees are flooding the italian island of lampedusa kreissl-doerfler also accused the commission of doing too little to remind countries like italy of their responsibility " yes , the eu could do a lot , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .
so , while solidarity is now being called for by the southern countries , they were n't offering it before . "

in three rounds of inconclusive balloting on thursday , march 26 , amano , 61 , polled more votes than minty , 69 , but fell short of the 24 required under the agency 's rules .
on friday , the board resorted to two runoff , " yes , no or abstain " ballots for each candidate .
amano took 22 " yes " votes , 12 " no " and one abstention .
minty garnered 15 " yes " votes , 19 " no " with one abstention .
the nuclear watchdog has a 35-member board .
a new ballot is likely to be held in may , possibly with new candidates " the slate of candidates is considered to have been wiped clean , " ambassador taous feroukhi of algeria , chairman of the vienna-based governing board , told reporters .
bridging the rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-baradei had several spats with the bush administration over iran the inconclusive balloting can be attributed to the rich-poor divide that both amano and minty failed to bridge .
amano , japan 's permanent representative and ambassador , had drawn the backing of wealthy - mainly western - nuclear powers .
minty , pretoria 's long-time iaea governor , on the other hand , was supported primarily by developing countries .
" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .
" we were hopeful that those who advocated change and a relationship with the developing world based on trust and partnership would - in this important election process - have implemented these noble ideals , but sadly it appears as this has only remained as good intentions , " he said in a statement to governors .
a senior official from the japanese foreign ministry informed reporters that amano would run again .
amano has been criticized for lacking charisma , while some western nations perceive minty as too outspoken .
the iaea is tasked with detecting secret nuclear bomb programs as well as coordinating global cooperation in sharing energy for peaceful purposes .
egyptian nobel prize-winner el-baradei , who has been director of the iaea since 1997 , has had a difficult job recently , arguing with the bush administration over what he viewed as its warlike approach to resolving iran 's nuclear issue .
in turn , the us has accused him of overstepping his mandate as well as being too " soft " on iran .
iaea has new hope with obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant could be a concern for the new iaea director iaea officials are now hopeful that the us foreign policy under president barack obama will lead to smoother cooperation as well as an increase in the iaea 's budget , which el-baradei has referred to as " shoestring . "
obama has already signaled his readiness to talk without preconditions to iran and syria , which are both under investigation by the iaea .
new candidates who might enter the running to become the new iaea director include former mexican president ernesto zedillo and hungarian tibor toth , head of the un panel monitoring the nuclear-test-ban treaty -lrb- ctbto -rrb- .
new candidates have 28 days from monday to indicate their intentions .
analysts have said that third world members of the iaea favor a politically strong director general , while many europeans and the united states are more interested in having a technocrat run the agency . ls / tt / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the controversy reignited after a top medical research journal added its voice to criticism of the pontiff . in an editorial , the lancet said the pontiff 's remarks were " wildly inaccurate " and could have " devastating consequences . "
the journal also questioned whether the pope 's comments were made out of ignorance or as a deliberate attempt to support catholic ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems the whole world is now listening when the pope speaks the lancet , one of the world 's leading medical research journals , was emphatic about the impact of the pontiff 's remarks and has called for the head of the catholic church to retract his remarks .
" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .
unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "
french bishop fuels controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is ravaging much of sub-saharan africa and its victims are both young and old monsignor andre fort , the bishop of the french city of orleans , fanned the flames of the dispute on friday by supporting the pontiff 's view of condoms .
fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .
health experts however say there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . ls / jp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
rutten 's backroom coaching team of mike bueskens , youri mulder and oliver reck will take control of the first team until a successor has been found .

the controversy reignited after a top medical research journal added its voice to criticism of the pontiff . in an editorial , the lancet said the pontiff 's remarks were " wildly inaccurate " and could have " devastating consequences . "
the journal also questioned whether the pope 's comments were made out of ignorance or as a deliberate attempt to support catholic ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems the whole world is now listening when the pope speaks the lancet , one of the world 's leading medical research journals , was emphatic about the impact of the pontiff 's remarks and has called for the head of the catholic church to retract his remarks .
" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .
unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "
french bishop fuels controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is ravaging much of sub-saharan africa and its victims are both young and old monsignor andre fort , the bishop of the french city of orleans , fanned the flames of the dispute on friday by supporting the pontiff 's view of condoms .
fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .
health experts however say there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . ls / jp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "
separate incident the attack came less than 24 hours after a smaller greek-owned vessel was seized in the same area .
the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .
a greek merchant marine ministry spokesman said the chemical tanker 's russian captain and 18 filipino crew members were in good health and that the boat 's owner , lotus shipping , had begun negotiations with the pirates .
a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .
dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
the latest attacks occurred even though more than 20 warships from the eu , nato , china and russia patrol the area around the horn of africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the european union play a more active role in cracking down on piracy ?
the eu launched its first-ever naval operation in december with six warships and three surveillance planes in the region .
but patrolling over a million square miles of ocean is a challenging task , and their presence seems to be little deterrent .
ransom-hunting somali pirates attacked more than 130 merchant ships in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , according to the international maritime bureau .
in the wake of the incidents , greece , which is home to the biggest commercial fleet in the world , called on the eu " to play a more active role " in cracking down on piracy .
merchant marine minister anastasis papaligouras said the eu should " expand the rules of engagement and the area patrolled by the european naval force . "
he also called on shipping companies " to inform with total accuracy and in good time the competent services " about the movements of boats . jp / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .
france , for instance , has allegedly expressed an interest in working with the afghan police force , while the times reported friday that britain is ready to send more troops to support the increase in us troop numbers . the acid test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe that pakistan is a greater threat to us national security than afghanistan german chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , agrees that nato has to succeed in afghanistan to stop it becoming again a base for " terrorists " from which to attack alliance member countries . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " she said on thursday .
" for me our aim remains clear : that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries . " " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .
the german parliament voted last year to increase this to 4,500 . germany 's troops are based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , but merkel stressed thursday that her country is already pulling its weight in terms of police support and civilian reconstruction work . " with our performances so far in afghanistan so far , we as germans can really see ourselves as part of the alliance ...
i will stress this fully at the summit .
i believe we can be satisfied with our performance , " she said .
" our principle remains the same : there can be no security without reconstruction , and there can be reconstruction without security . jp / nda / tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he knew he always wanted to play professional football .
his english fans know him better by his nickname - " hitz the hammer . " dw-tv : we 've talked about how to best strike the ball , give it the hammer treatment so it rockets into goal .
how do you do it ?
do you hit it straight on or more from the side ?
thomas hitzlsperger : for me , the best way to shoot is straight on , but there 's a science to it .
people have found out the exact spot you need to hit the ball to score a goal , what the best angle is and with what type of movement .
that 's just way too much science .
i do n't really get involved with that , i 've just practiced it over and over again and developed a feeling .
what was your fastest shot ?
do you know ?
that was measured in a training session , i think i had about 135 kilometers per hour , give or take a kilometer or two .
in a match not so long ago it was 125 kilometers per hour .
against leverkusen .
that 's right against leverkusen .
as a junior , hitzlsperger played for bayern munich .
then , at the age of 18 , he realized his ambition of becoming a professional footballer , signing up with aston villa in the english premiere league .
in 2005 , he returned to germany to play for stuttgart where he reached another milestone .
in 2007 you became bundesliga champions .
that was something you played a big part in , scoring crucial equalizers in the final two matches of the season .
that must have been quite a big deal .
how did it feel ?
it 's difficult to describe .
actually , it 's something you dream about .
when you go to bed and dream about football , you see yourself about to shoot a deciding goal in an all-important final match .
that one came pretty close to the dream .
it the last day of the season .
we had to win .
we were down one-nil and suddenly i had the ball and scored a goal .
that was one of those moments when you think football is fantastic , because right then you only have seconds and you want to do something special .
but it 's not what i do .
it 's the goal itself that 's special .
you 're the leading player at stuttgart , the captain .
are you ready for role like that in the national squad ?
a larger role ?
i 've always felt i should be in top form and always try to improve myself .
that 's why i 've always seen my role as trying to be the best i can be and playing the best football i can play .
i 've always done that and will continue to do that . "
hitzlsperger is the workhorse of the german team .
but the midfielder is fighting for his place against the likes of thorsten frings , jermaine jones and simon rolfes .
in the last two friendlies , the hammer 's had to watch from the sidelines .
how do you deal with this very competitive environment ?
i 'd have to say it 's had a positive effect , because i know that when i play it 's not going to be forever .
it 's just for the moment , and at that moment i might be a little bit better than the others .
a few weeks later it might be completely different .
so it increases the pressure and my own willingness to do more .
that 's my goal .
i want to always be on the national team , because it really is something special and i 'll only be able to do that if i continue to develop .
i realise that because there are two or three really good players who could immediately step in .
i always want to be there and i hope i will be .
this is a competitive environment which is pushing me forward and i think that 's true for the others as well .
germany lost last the two friendlies against england and norway , both matches without hitzlsperger .
we have to take that very seriously .
we ca n't just say , " it 's over , let 's move on . "
i wish we could mentally , but in preparing for the upcoming match against liechtenstein we 'll have to focus on it again .
once we get there we might start thinking about the last league match and not the last two internationals .
we have to deal with it and i expect the coach will be addressing it as well .
he does n't want to see it happen again .
so he 'll talk to us indivdiually to find out why we were n't in top form back then .
and maybe he 'll draw the conclusions about what we need to do to win convincingly against liechtenstein and do the same thing against wales .
but beyond liechtenstein and wales , germany faces its toughest opponent in october , russia .
that match could decide who winds up going to south africa .
only the first placed team in the group automatically qualifies for the world cup .
if germany qualifies , what would that mean for you personally ?
to experience the world cup in south africa would be fantastic for me .
i want to play in as many of these competitions as possible , world cups and european championships .
that will continue to push my development as a player .
that 's the main reason i want the title , to bring the trophy home to germany .
it would really be something special .
in the last world cup we were third .
in the last european championship we came second .
so it would be a great triumph if we took the title in south africa .
but it is very , very difficult and so too is qualifying .
it 's a constant struggle and we 'll have to improve ourselves a lot .
but i 'm very confident . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he knew he always wanted to play professional football .
his english fans know him better by his nickname - " hitz the hammer . " dw-tv : we 've talked about how to best strike the ball , give it the hammer treatment so it rockets into goal .
how do you do it ?
do you hit it straight on or more from the side ?
thomas hitzlsperger : for me , the best way to shoot is straight on , but there 's a science to it .
people have found out the exact spot you need to hit the ball to score a goal , what the best angle is and with what type of movement .
that 's just way too much science .
i do n't really get involved with that , i 've just practiced it over and over again and developed a feeling .
what was your fastest shot ?
do you know ?
that was measured in a training session , i think i had about 135 kilometers per hour , give or take a kilometer or two .
in a match not so long ago it was 125 kilometers per hour .
against leverkusen .
that 's right against leverkusen .
as a junior , hitzlsperger played for bayern munich .
then , at the age of 18 , he realized his ambition of becoming a professional footballer , signing up with aston villa in the english premiere league .
in 2005 , he returned to germany to play for stuttgart where he reached another milestone .
in 2007 you became bundesliga champions .
that was something you played a big part in , scoring crucial equalizers in the final two matches of the season .
that must have been quite a big deal .
how did it feel ?
it 's difficult to describe .
actually , it 's something you dream about .
when you go to bed and dream about football , you see yourself about to shoot a deciding goal in an all-important final match .
that one came pretty close to the dream .
it the last day of the season .
we had to win .
we were down one-nil and suddenly i had the ball and scored a goal .
that was one of those moments when you think football is fantastic , because right then you only have seconds and you want to do something special .
but it 's not what i do .
it 's the goal itself that 's special .
you 're the leading player at stuttgart , the captain .
are you ready for role like that in the national squad ?
a larger role ?
i 've always felt i should be in top form and always try to improve myself .
that 's why i 've always seen my role as trying to be the best i can be and playing the best football i can play .
i 've always done that and will continue to do that . "
hitzlsperger is the workhorse of the german team .
but the midfielder is fighting for his place against the likes of thorsten frings , jermaine jones and simon rolfes .
in the last two friendlies , the hammer 's had to watch from the sidelines .
how do you deal with this very competitive environment ?
i 'd have to say it 's had a positive effect , because i know that when i play it 's not going to be forever .
it 's just for the moment , and at that moment i might be a little bit better than the others .
a few weeks later it might be completely different .
so it increases the pressure and my own willingness to do more .
that 's my goal .
i want to always be on the national team , because it really is something special and i 'll only be able to do that if i continue to develop .
i realise that because there are two or three really good players who could immediately step in .
i always want to be there and i hope i will be .
this is a competitive environment which is pushing me forward and i think that 's true for the others as well .
germany lost last the two friendlies against england and norway , both matches without hitzlsperger .
we have to take that very seriously .
we ca n't just say , " it 's over , let 's move on . "
i wish we could mentally , but in preparing for the upcoming match against liechtenstein we 'll have to focus on it again .
once we get there we might start thinking about the last league match and not the last two internationals .
we have to deal with it and i expect the coach will be addressing it as well .
he does n't want to see it happen again .
so he 'll talk to us indivdiually to find out why we were n't in top form back then .
and maybe he 'll draw the conclusions about what we need to do to win convincingly against liechtenstein and do the same thing against wales .
but beyond liechtenstein and wales , germany faces its toughest opponent in october , russia .
that match could decide who winds up going to south africa .
only the first placed team in the group automatically qualifies for the world cup .
if germany qualifies , what would that mean for you personally ?
to experience the world cup in south africa would be fantastic for me .
i want to play in as many of these competitions as possible , world cups and european championships .
that will continue to push my development as a player .
that 's the main reason i want the title , to bring the trophy home to germany .
it would really be something special .
in the last world cup we were third .
in the last european championship we came second .
so it would be a great triumph if we took the title in south africa .
but it is very , very difficult and so too is qualifying .
it 's a constant struggle and we 'll have to improve ourselves a lot .
but i 'm very confident . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.03.2009 eu praises obama on afghanistan , pledges civilian surge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the size of the afghan army will swell from 80,000 to 134,000 the eu will embrace us president barack obama 's " european-style " strategy for afghanistan and will contribute to a " civilian surge " by providing more money and more police trainers , the bloc 's foreign ministers said . " -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security .

these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .

this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , because it threatened our security , the members of nato , " she said . but she also has an upcoming general election to consider - and germany 's mission in afghanistan , the country 's first major overseas military operation since world war two , remains unpopular at home . a survey published this week showed that 58 percent want german troops to come home and only 36 percent are in favor of the mission continuing . germany currently has 3,640 troops stationed in afghanistan , one of 41 nations forming the 60,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force .

" -lrb- obama 's -rrb- new strategy comes very close to the european ideas about the mission in afghanistan , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier during informal eu talks in the czech republic on friday , march 27 .
the us president unveiled his administration 's strategic review for afghanistan in a renewed effort to stabilize the country , saying a major goal will be to shut down the al-qaeda terrorist network in afghanistan and pakistan using a bolstered troop presence .
" we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al-qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan , and to prevent theirreturn to either country in the future , " obama said . the announcement came at a time when violence in afghanistan is at its highest level since us-led forces invaded in 2001 to oust the taliban from power . it echoed a long-standing european view that the taliban insurgency can not be defeated by military means alone .
instead , the us is now planning a wider approach to the problem , involving pakistan and other regional players , and helping afghanistan take care of its own security . " i believe that the president 's announcement today will strike a very strong chord with europeans , " said british foreign minister david miliband , whose country is the second-largest contributor after the us to nato 's operations in afghanistan . more personnel , more funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for obama , defeating al-qaeda is the top priority in afghanistan in the next six weeks , the us will already be sending a combat aviation brigade of some 3500 soldiers with more than 100 helicopters in a mission that will double the number of us helicopters in the country . a further 8000 us marines with another 50 helicopters will arrive over the next two months followed by an armored infantry brigade of some 3500 to 4000 troops , the us military says . as part of the new strategy , obama now plans to send hundreds more civilian officials into afghanistan to boost under-resourced reconstruction and development programs , and is also expected to support a bi-partisan senate bill to triple us aid to afghanistan to $ 1.5 billion a year for five years , also looking at needed military assistance , particularly helicopters to transport troops to war zones . moreover , the us will stump up billions of dollars of extra aid to help anti-terror ally pakistan secure its democracy , senior administration officials said , helping islamabad crack down on al qaeda and taliban havens . bildunterschrift : german troops are based in the north of the country joined-up strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an added 4,000 troops are to be deployed to train afghan security forces in a speech to parliament ahead of nato 's 60th anniversary summit along the german-french border on april 3-4 , german chancellor angela merkel welcomed obama 's moves to develop a joined-up strategy for both afghanistan and pakistan , but " without forgetting that not all pakistan 's problems are also afghan problems .
these remain two different countries . " echoing the white house officials who said the taliban had made a " very significant comeback in the last two years " that could not be allowed to take root , merkel also issued a firm no to any prospect of holding talks with the taliban in order to put an end to the insurgency raging in large parts of afghanistan . " we must work more closely with those who want to reconstruct their country , who respect the standards of the rule of law , whatever they may call themselves ...
but those who fight against reconstruction , who ride roughshod over human rights with violence and terror , can not be our partners , " she said . obama will be presenting his latest plans at the upcoming nato summit , which marks his first visit to europe since becoming us president in january .
he is expected to press allies in the alliance to do more in afghanistan . his administration reportedly also hopes to secure pledges for additional military help for the afghan war .

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally . "
addressing the stimulus packages some countries have introduced to address the economic downturn , lamy said , that these would aid economic growth by increasing demand , but some contained elements that favoured domestic goods and services .

while the wto has rules for its members on how high they can raise tariffs or boost subsidies , many countries keep their applied rates below the ceiling , giving them varying amounts of room to maneuver .
this means states could implement protectionist measures without actually violating their commitments .
a recent world bank report found that 17 of the g20 leading economies had implemented 47 protectionist measures since pledging not to at a summit last november .
in his report , a copy of which was obtained by the german press agency dpa , lamy called for the completion of the doha round of trade talks and said that , pending the conclusion of negotiations , countries should not use new trade restrictions and trade-distorting subsidies . mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wto director-general pascal lamy , in a report issued to wto members in the run-up to the g20 meeting of the world 's leading economies in london , said he specifically noticed an increase in tariffs , non-tariff measures and anti-dumping actions .
lamy was careful to point out that there were no signs of an imminent descent into intense tit-for-tat protectionism , but warned that " the danger today is of an incremental build-up of restrictions that could slowly strangle international trade and undercut the effectiveness of policies to boost aggregate demand and restore sustained growth globally . "
addressing the stimulus packages some countries have introduced to address the economic downturn , lamy said , that these would aid economic growth by increasing demand , but some contained elements that favoured domestic goods and services .
preventing another ' great depression ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some national stimulus packages are affecting global growth the report , issued a week before the g20 meeting , highlights one of the key issues for the summit : how to prevent job-shielding trade restrictions that could turn the global recession into a long lasting depression leading to unrest and even war , as happened after wall street collapsed in 1929 .
while the wto has rules for its members on how high they can raise tariffs or boost subsidies , many countries keep their applied rates below the ceiling , giving them varying amounts of room to maneuver .
this means states could implement protectionist measures without actually violating their commitments .
a recent world bank report found that 17 of the g20 leading economies had implemented 47 protectionist measures since pledging not to at a summit last november .
in his report , a copy of which was obtained by the german press agency dpa , lamy called for the completion of the doha round of trade talks and said that , pending the conclusion of negotiations , countries should not use new trade restrictions and trade-distorting subsidies . mrm / nda / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "

the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .

a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .
dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .

in three rounds of inconclusive balloting on thursday , march 26 , amano , 61 , polled more votes than minty , 69 , but fell short of the 24 required under the agency 's rules .
on friday , the board resorted to two runoff , " yes , no or abstain " ballots for each candidate .
amano took 22 " yes " votes , 12 " no " and one abstention .
minty garnered 15 " yes " votes , 19 " no " with one abstention .

" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .
" we were hopeful that those who advocated change and a relationship with the developing world based on trust and partnership would - in this important election process - have implemented these noble ideals , but sadly it appears as this has only remained as good intentions , " he said in a statement to governors .

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "
separate incident the attack came less than 24 hours after a smaller greek-owned vessel was seized in the same area .
the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .
a greek merchant marine ministry spokesman said the chemical tanker 's russian captain and 18 filipino crew members were in good health and that the boat 's owner , lotus shipping , had begun negotiations with the pirates .
a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .
dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .

in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .
" the policy of the commission in this situation is to demonstrate solidarity so that we can help refugees and the eu countries that are trying to handle the situation , " said laitenberger .
solidarity in accepting refugees is one thing .
but german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble already summarized in 2005 how he envisioned eu member states solving the refugee problem .
" in addition to more efficient border controls that they need , they must fight the causes and cooperate with the neighboring states , " he said .
eu has responsibility for refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has put the emphasis on preventing refugees from making it to europe the eu has been trying to prevent streams of refuges this way for several years .
but critics say that the eu 's entire refugee policy is too defensive .
" better protection and more access to lasting solutions in the refugees ' country of origin is a respectable goal " said antónio guterres , the un high commissioner for refugee matters back in 2006 .
" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .
europe is a continent of asylum and must remain this way . "
european parliamentarian wolfgang kreissl-doerfler visited lampedusa four years ago with a parliamentarian group .
he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .
yet these people sometimes do n't even get a chance to apply , particularly in greece and italy . "
" they are not informed about their right to asylum .
they are immediately put in custody , pending deportation , and are then swiftly transported away , " he said .
eu doing too little bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees are flooding the italian island of lampedusa kreissl-doerfler also accused the commission of doing too little to remind countries like italy of their responsibility " yes , the eu could do a lot , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .
so , while solidarity is now being called for by the southern countries , they were n't offering it before . "

a norwegian chemical tanker was seized some 720 kilometers off the coast of somalia on thursday , march 26 , by pirates armed with machine guns .
the european union 's military spokesman said the 23,000-ton bow asir , which is registered in the bahamas , was captured on its way to the persian gulf .
salhus shipping , which owns the tanker , said in a statement that the crew numbered 27 members of different nationalities and that they had contacted the company after 16 to 18 pirates came aboard with automatic weapons .
" we have no reports of any injuries , " said company director per hansen .
" we are doing our utmost to ensure the safety of the crew , and have established communication lines with naval forces , insurance companies , flag state and charterer . "
separate incident the attack came less than 24 hours after a smaller greek-owned vessel was seized in the same area .
the 9,000-ton panamanian-flagged m.v. nipayia , with 19 crew members , was hijacked 720 kilometers off somalia on wednesday afternoon .
a greek merchant marine ministry spokesman said the chemical tanker 's russian captain and 18 filipino crew members were in good health and that the boat 's owner , lotus shipping , had begun negotiations with the pirates .
a more active role shipping routes off the coasts of eastern and western africa have become increasingly dangerous in recent months , especially in the gulf of aden , gulf of guinea , off the coast of cameroon and nigeria .
dozens of ships seized by pirates have been released only after owners paid tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
the latest attacks occurred even though more than 20 warships from the eu , nato , china and russia patrol the area around the horn of africa .

ransom-hunting somali pirates attacked more than 130 merchant ships in the region last year , an increase of more than 200 percent on 2007 , according to the international maritime bureau .
in the wake of the incidents , greece , which is home to the biggest commercial fleet in the world , called on the eu " to play a more active role " in cracking down on piracy .

a previous grouping of hitler paintings , sold two years ago , fetched twice their estimated value . among the 13 pieces to be sold on april 23 at the mullock 's auction house in shropshire , england , is a self-portrait painted by hitler when he was a young struggling artist living in vienna .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before becoming leader of nazi germany , hitler applied , and failed to get into , art school the watercolor shows hitler sitting pensively on a stone bridge , wearing a brown suit .
his face lacks a nose and mouth , as well as the trademark square moustache .
two years ago , 21 paintings attributed to hitler were sold for 118,000 pounds -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- , or more than twice the pre-sale estimate , by an auction house in cornwall .
but some art experts voiced doubts about the paintings ' authenticity .
richard westwood-brookes , a historical documents expert who will be holding the sale for mullocks , told reuters news agency that he 's seen quite a bit of hitler art and that all the subjects tend to be the same , explaining that hitler liked to paint pictures of flowers , especially roses , and romantic landscapes with cottages .
buyer beware those doing the bidding in next month 's auction will most likely be history buffs interested in adolf hitler as a historic figure .
the paintings are mostly watercolors and signed with hitler 's initials .
" they 're not exactly the greatest pictures in the world , " westwood-brookes said , adding they could fetch between 400 and 1,000 pounds .
westwood-brookes said an austrian expert had issued certificates of authenticity for the pictures , which once belonged to a british soldier stationed in essen , germany , in 1945 .
the authenticity of hitler 's work has long been a bone of contention .
in 1983 , a british historian was taken in by diaries purportedly written by hitler that became a sensation before turning out to be forgeries . mrm / tt / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the controversy reignited after a top medical research journal added its voice to criticism of the pontiff . in an editorial , the lancet said the pontiff 's remarks were " wildly inaccurate " and could have " devastating consequences . "
the journal also questioned whether the pope 's comments were made out of ignorance or as a deliberate attempt to support catholic ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems the whole world is now listening when the pope speaks the lancet , one of the world 's leading medical research journals , was emphatic about the impact of the pontiff 's remarks and has called for the head of the catholic church to retract his remarks .
" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "

fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .

the controversy reignited after a top medical research journal added its voice to criticism of the pontiff . in an editorial , the lancet said the pontiff 's remarks were " wildly inaccurate " and could have " devastating consequences . "
the journal also questioned whether the pope 's comments were made out of ignorance or as a deliberate attempt to support catholic ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems the whole world is now listening when the pope speaks the lancet , one of the world 's leading medical research journals , was emphatic about the impact of the pontiff 's remarks and has called for the head of the catholic church to retract his remarks .
" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .
unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "
french bishop fuels controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is ravaging much of sub-saharan africa and its victims are both young and old monsignor andre fort , the bishop of the french city of orleans , fanned the flames of the dispute on friday by supporting the pontiff 's view of condoms .
fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .
health experts however say there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . ls / jp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in brussels , commission spokesperson johannes laitenberger then called on other eu countries to help .
" the policy of the commission in this situation is to demonstrate solidarity so that we can help refugees and the eu countries that are trying to handle the situation , " said laitenberger .
solidarity in accepting refugees is one thing .
but german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble already summarized in 2005 how he envisioned eu member states solving the refugee problem .
" in addition to more efficient border controls that they need , they must fight the causes and cooperate with the neighboring states , " he said .
eu has responsibility for refugees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble has put the emphasis on preventing refugees from making it to europe the eu has been trying to prevent streams of refuges this way for several years .
but critics say that the eu 's entire refugee policy is too defensive .
" better protection and more access to lasting solutions in the refugees ' country of origin is a respectable goal " said antónio guterres , the un high commissioner for refugee matters back in 2006 .
" but this should not come at the expense of europe 's own responsibility to grant asylum to those who need it .
europe is a continent of asylum and must remain this way . "
european parliamentarian wolfgang kreissl-doerfler visited lampedusa four years ago with a parliamentarian group .
he was shocked by the state of the refugee camps , and he has seen no improvement since then .
" now everything is being thrown into one pot again - that 's the problem , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" some people come as economic refugees , but others have a right to asylum and can ask for it .
yet these people sometimes do n't even get a chance to apply , particularly in greece and italy . "
" they are not informed about their right to asylum .
they are immediately put in custody , pending deportation , and are then swiftly transported away , " he said .
eu doing too little bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees are flooding the italian island of lampedusa kreissl-doerfler also accused the commission of doing too little to remind countries like italy of their responsibility " yes , the eu could do a lot , " kreissl-doerfler said .
" it is n't about finances - it 's about saying : we have a refugee problem not only in the mediterranean but also in poland , hungary , the czech republic and a bit in germany , and we will determine contingent numbers for the individual countries and divide the refugees up accordingly . "
" i must say this : when we had the great flood of refugees at the beginning of the 90s with 280,000 asylum-seekers a year , nothing was seen from the other eu countries .
so , while solidarity is now being called for by the southern countries , they were n't offering it before . "

" when any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" anything less from pope benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of hiv / aids worldwide . "
during his first tour of africa earlier this month , pope benedict said that hiv / aids was " a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem . "
the german , french and belgian governments were quick to condemn the remarks , as were aid organizations .
unaids , the un population fund and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- released statements defending the use of condoms as the " single , most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of hiv . "
french bishop fuels controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is ravaging much of sub-saharan africa and its victims are both young and old monsignor andre fort , the bishop of the french city of orleans , fanned the flames of the dispute on friday by supporting the pontiff 's view of condoms .
fort told a french radio station on friday that " on a cigarette pack there is written ' danger . '
we should be writing on a box of condoms : reliability doubtful . "
he also said that " all the scientists know it : the aids virus is infinitely smaller than a sperm .
this is proof that the condom is not a 100 percent guarantee against aids . "
the head of the national agency for aids research , jean-francois delfraissy , was quick to fire back , telling france info radio that bishop fort 's comments were " totally false . "
" we have data that prove that the condom is a fundamental element in blocking the aids virus during sex .
this is an established fact , " delfraissy said .
last week , the vatican tried to ease the controversy surrounding pope benedict 's comments in africa , noting on its web site that he had actually said that condoms merely " risked " aggravating the problem of aids .
health experts however say there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . ls / jp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in three rounds of inconclusive balloting on thursday , march 26 , amano , 61 , polled more votes than minty , 69 , but fell short of the 24 required under the agency 's rules .
on friday , the board resorted to two runoff , " yes , no or abstain " ballots for each candidate .
amano took 22 " yes " votes , 12 " no " and one abstention .
minty garnered 15 " yes " votes , 19 " no " with one abstention .
the nuclear watchdog has a 35-member board .
a new ballot is likely to be held in may , possibly with new candidates " the slate of candidates is considered to have been wiped clean , " ambassador taous feroukhi of algeria , chairman of the vienna-based governing board , told reporters .
bridging the rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-baradei had several spats with the bush administration over iran the inconclusive balloting can be attributed to the rich-poor divide that both amano and minty failed to bridge .
amano , japan 's permanent representative and ambassador , had drawn the backing of wealthy - mainly western - nuclear powers .
minty , pretoria 's long-time iaea governor , on the other hand , was supported primarily by developing countries .
" a consensus candidate -lrb- is needed -rrb- , someone who does n't mark out clear differences like this ... between the developed and developing countries , " feroukhi said .
minty , who did not announce whether or not he would run again in the next ballot , expressed disappointment at the result of friday 's voting .
" we were hopeful that those who advocated change and a relationship with the developing world based on trust and partnership would - in this important election process - have implemented these noble ideals , but sadly it appears as this has only remained as good intentions , " he said in a statement to governors .
a senior official from the japanese foreign ministry informed reporters that amano would run again .
amano has been criticized for lacking charisma , while some western nations perceive minty as too outspoken .
the iaea is tasked with detecting secret nuclear bomb programs as well as coordinating global cooperation in sharing energy for peaceful purposes .
egyptian nobel prize-winner el-baradei , who has been director of the iaea since 1997 , has had a difficult job recently , arguing with the bush administration over what he viewed as its warlike approach to resolving iran 's nuclear issue .
in turn , the us has accused him of overstepping his mandate as well as being too " soft " on iran .
iaea has new hope with obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant could be a concern for the new iaea director iaea officials are now hopeful that the us foreign policy under president barack obama will lead to smoother cooperation as well as an increase in the iaea 's budget , which el-baradei has referred to as " shoestring . "
obama has already signaled his readiness to talk without preconditions to iran and syria , which are both under investigation by the iaea .
new candidates who might enter the running to become the new iaea director include former mexican president ernesto zedillo and hungarian tibor toth , head of the un panel monitoring the nuclear-test-ban treaty -lrb- ctbto -rrb- .
new candidates have 28 days from monday to indicate their intentions .
analysts have said that third world members of the iaea favor a politically strong director general , while many europeans and the united states are more interested in having a technocrat run the agency . ls / tt / dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the citizens advice bureau , shelter , crisis and the chartered institute of housing have joined forces to highlight what they say is a growing problem .
they want new laws in england and wales to give tenants more notice when their home is repossessed by mortgage firms .
currently only two weeks ' notice is required , leaving many homeless .
the government has so far said it will increase it to seven weeks , from 6 april .
' forgotten victims ' private sector tenants have few rights to protect them when their buy-to-let landlords get into trouble , say the campaigners .
a survey carried out by crisis found that 60 % of its advisers had been approached by people who had lost their home in this way , 80 % of whom said the problem was increasing .
the groups said the tenants of these properties were the " forgotten victims of the repossession crisis " .
from the today programme more from today programme the charities estimate that more than 8,000 buy-to-let properties could be repossessed in the coming year , with at least 10,000 people being made unexpectedly homeless .
in some cases families are given no warning at all , sometimes returning home to find locks had been changed and their possessions out on the street , they said .
in one instance a family had to spend the night sleeping in their car , before being moved into emergency hostel accommodation , when their rented home was repossessed .
' lender behaviour ' the charities are calling for the law to be changed to allow courts to defer repossessions , enabling tenants to find new accommodation .
they have written to mps urging them to sign an early day motion calling for the law to be changed .
more also needed to be done to make tenants aware of repossession proceedings , such as getting the courts to send notices clearly marked " to the tenant " of a property , in addition to notices currently sent " to the occupier " by mortgage lenders . "
we risk forgetting that tenants of private landlords are extremely vulnerable to the recession " leslie morphy , crisis shelter chief executive adam sampson said they had seen a " steep rise " in cases .
" tenants who have kept their side of the bargain by paying their rent are being thrown out on to the street because their landlords have defaulted on the mortgage . "
leslie morphy , of crisis , said with the economic troubles the focus was mainly on homeowners .
" we risk forgetting that tenants of private landlords are extremely vulnerable to the recession , " he said .
the council of mortgage lenders said many lenders would consider continuing a tenancy if a landlord got into difficulties , with the tenant paying their rent directly to the lender for the period of the tenancy .
but it said in some cases , landlords might be renting out a property that had an owner-occupier mortgage on it , without the lender 's knowledge .
a spokesman for the department of communities and local government said they were " determined " to make sure tenants facing eviction through no fault of their own were protected .
other than increasing the notice period to seven weeks , the department said it was looking into what more help could be provided for tenants , either through legislation or " influencing lender behaviour " .
" in the first instance , it is vital that landlords struggling with their payments contact their lender , " added the spokesman .

leslie morphy , of crisis , said with the economic troubles the focus was mainly on homeowners .
" we risk forgetting that tenants of private landlords are extremely vulnerable to the recession , " he said .
the council of mortgage lenders said many lenders would consider continuing a tenancy if a landlord got into difficulties , with the tenant paying their rent directly to the lender for the period of the tenancy .
but it said in some cases , landlords might be renting out a property that had an owner-occupier mortgage on it , without the lender 's knowledge .
a spokesman for the department of communities and local government said they were " determined " to make sure tenants facing eviction through no fault of their own were protected .
other than increasing the notice period to seven weeks , the department said it was looking into what more help could be provided for tenants , either through legislation or " influencing lender behaviour " .
" in the first instance , it is vital that landlords struggling with their payments contact their lender , " added the spokesman .

the study , which looked at the reactions of hermit crabs to small electric shocks , was carried out by professor bob elwood and mirjam appel .
the crabs reacted adversely to the shocks but also seemed to try to avoid future shocks , suggesting that they recalled the past ones .
the research is published in the journal animal behaviour .
professor elwood said the research highlighted the need to investigate how crustaceans used in food industries are treated , saying that a " potentially very large problem " was being ignored .
shell shocked hermit crabs have no shell of their own so inhabit other structures .
as part of the research , wires were attached to shells to deliver small shocks to the abdomen of some of the crabs .
the study revealed the only crabs to get out of their shells were those which had received shocks , indicating that the experience was unpleasant for them .
legislation to protect crustaceans has been proposed but it is likely to cover only scientific research professor bob elwood hermit crabs are known to prefer some species of shells to others and it was found that they were more likely to come out of the shells they least preferred .
the main aim of the experiment was to deliver a shock just under the threshold that causes crabs to move out of the shell , to see what happened when a new shell was then offered .
those responsible for the study said crabs that had been shocked but remained in their shell appeared to remember the experience of the shock .
they said these crabs quickly moved towards the new shell , investigated it briefly and were more likely to change to the new shell compared to those that had not been shocked .
professor elwood , who previously carried out a study showing that prawns endure pain , said : " there has been a long debate about whether crustaceans including crabs , prawns and lobsters feel pain .

the study , which looked at the reactions of hermit crabs to small electric shocks , was carried out by professor bob elwood and mirjam appel .
the crabs reacted adversely to the shocks but also seemed to try to avoid future shocks , suggesting that they recalled the past ones .

shell shocked hermit crabs have no shell of their own so inhabit other structures .

the study , which looked at the reactions of hermit crabs to small electric shocks , was carried out by professor bob elwood and mirjam appel .
the crabs reacted adversely to the shocks but also seemed to try to avoid future shocks , suggesting that they recalled the past ones .
the research is published in the journal animal behaviour .
professor elwood said the research highlighted the need to investigate how crustaceans used in food industries are treated , saying that a " potentially very large problem " was being ignored .
shell shocked hermit crabs have no shell of their own so inhabit other structures .
as part of the research , wires were attached to shells to deliver small shocks to the abdomen of some of the crabs .
the study revealed the only crabs to get out of their shells were those which had received shocks , indicating that the experience was unpleasant for them .
legislation to protect crustaceans has been proposed but it is likely to cover only scientific research professor bob elwood hermit crabs are known to prefer some species of shells to others and it was found that they were more likely to come out of the shells they least preferred .
the main aim of the experiment was to deliver a shock just under the threshold that causes crabs to move out of the shell , to see what happened when a new shell was then offered .
those responsible for the study said crabs that had been shocked but remained in their shell appeared to remember the experience of the shock .
they said these crabs quickly moved towards the new shell , investigated it briefly and were more likely to change to the new shell compared to those that had not been shocked .
professor elwood , who previously carried out a study showing that prawns endure pain , said : " there has been a long debate about whether crustaceans including crabs , prawns and lobsters feel pain .
" we know from previous research that they can detect harmful stimuli and withdraw from the source of the stimuli but that could be a simple reflex without the inner ' feeling ' of unpleasantness that we associate with pain .
" this research demonstrates that it is not a simple reflex but that crabs trade-off their need for a quality shell with the need to avoid the harmful stimulus .
crustaceans given opportunity , they seem to avoid future shocks " trade-offs of this type have not been previously demonstrated in crustaceans .
the results are consistent with the idea of pain being experienced by these animals . "
queen 's said the findings of both studies were consistent with observations of pain in mammals .

" legislation to protect crustaceans has been proposed but it is likely to cover only scientific research , " he said .

our africa correspondent , andrew harding , has been to the mining centre of likasi , in the democratic republic of congo , where the global slowdown is already causing havoc .
no freight is leaving likasi 's abandoned mines and factories in the gentle green hills around likasi , the global economic meltdown makes a pleasant , twittering sound .
thousands of excited birds have begun nesting in the abandoned mines and factories that now litter the region - their songs abruptly replacing the throb and roar of machinery .
" all gone .
factory is closed .
no jobs , " says mr radju , guarding an empty indian-owned copper processing plant on the edge of likasi .
he shrugs and wanders away past a giant pile of dark , broken rocks .
g20 london summit world leaders will meet next week in london to discuss measures to tackle the downturn .
see our in-depth guide to the g20 summit .
the g20 countries are argentina , australia , brazil , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey , the united kingdom , the us and the eu .
q & a : g20 summit what brazil wants from g20 since december , more than 60 enterprises in this one town alone have shut .
many chinese businessmen simply locked their gates and fled the country , as the price and demand for copper collapsed spectacularly .
in katanga province as a whole , the authorities estimate that 300,000 people have lost their jobs virtually overnight .
" it 's a shock - a brutal shock , " admitted denis kalundgi , the urbane mayor of likasi , surveying the town 's deeply potholed streets , now crowded with unemployed and frustrated men .
mr kalundgi said he was concerned that social tensions could quickly boil over .
" we 're suffering .
fifty per cent of the economy has gone .
for now , we are managing -lsb- to pay salaries -rsb- .
but only just . "
vulnerable families the world 's economic storm has hit dr congo just as this vast , dilapidated , conflict-ridden country was beginning to shrug off decades of turmoil and decline .
largely thanks to soaring mineral prices , the drc 's economy was projected to grow by up to 12 % last year .
around the continent as a whole , it was a similar story .
despite some glaring exceptions , africa has enjoyed a decade of impressive growth .
but today , adelard kihoho is discovering just how vulnerable the continent remains to a sudden downturn .
the 37-year-old mine worker lost his foundry job in december last year .
adelard kihoho has big family responsibilities " the foreign owners just told us to leave one day , " he said .
" i do n't know how long this will last .
before , i was earning about $ 250 a month , but now i am just trying to sell a few things on the street to survive . "
adelard has seven of his own children and two of his brother 's children to support .
they sleep together in a small , dark room on the outskirts of likasi .
with no welfare state to fall back on , adelard has been forced to make some painful choices since he lost his job .
since he can no longer afford to send all the children to school , seven-year-old naomi and three of her brothers now spend their days at home , waiting for the mines to reopen .
" they say the great powers are to blame for this , " said adelard .
" but it is we who are suffering . "
he wondered out loud whether " president obama can fix this " .
like many african countries , the drc is looking to the imf for urgent new loans to help it weather the current storm .
the g20 summit is expected to hear calls for at least $ 30bn in outside help for africa .
but grim as things are , it 's still possible to find optimists here .
defiantly upbeat it is a 20-minute helicopter ride from likasi to boss mining 's giant new copper and cobalt mine .
from the air , you can see where huge hills have been peeled and sliced apart by armies of mechanical diggers .
" it 's been really tough , " concedes gordon thompson , the chief operating officer of boss mining 's parent company , the british-registered central africa mining and exploration company .
work has come to a virtual standstill , but none of the workforce has been laid off .
the impact of the new mine is best seen from overhead " this is a very challenging environment .
but congo has to -lsb- bounce back -rsb- .
it does n't have an option , does it ?
we 're seeing it as an opportunity , " he says .
" we expect to be operating again in the next few weeks .
" our business will recover and grow , and it 's going to get stronger . "
he acknowledges congo 's need for a " leg-up " from the imf , but warns against " handouts " , saying : " the money will just be spent and we 'll be knocking at the door again for more in no time . "
back in likasi , mayor kalundgi is racing between meetings , trying to end a strike by unpaid railway workers .
but he , too , is defiantly upbeat .
" we did n't want this , but now it 's happened , we ca n't just fold our arms .
this crisis can have a positive effect , " he says .
" there is a need for foreign help , but there 's also the mobilisation of internal resources .
" we have learned a lesson from this - it 's made us realise that we ca n't just rely on copper and cobalt exports .
we need to diversify . "
warming to his theme , he speaks of persuading mining companies to start plant corn .
" the real problem we have right now is that we produce what we do n't consume and we do n't produce what we do consume .
we need to change this state of affairs throughout the country . "

our africa correspondent , andrew harding , has been to the mining centre of likasi , in the democratic republic of congo , where the global slowdown is already causing havoc .
no freight is leaving likasi 's abandoned mines and factories in the gentle green hills around likasi , the global economic meltdown makes a pleasant , twittering sound .
thousands of excited birds have begun nesting in the abandoned mines and factories that now litter the region - their songs abruptly replacing the throb and roar of machinery .
" all gone .
factory is closed .
no jobs , " says mr radju , guarding an empty indian-owned copper processing plant on the edge of likasi .
he shrugs and wanders away past a giant pile of dark , broken rocks .
g20 london summit world leaders will meet next week in london to discuss measures to tackle the downturn .
see our in-depth guide to the g20 summit .
the g20 countries are argentina , australia , brazil , canada , china , france , germany , india , indonesia , italy , japan , mexico , russia , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey , the united kingdom , the us and the eu .
q & a : g20 summit what brazil wants from g20 since december , more than 60 enterprises in this one town alone have shut .
many chinese businessmen simply locked their gates and fled the country , as the price and demand for copper collapsed spectacularly .
in katanga province as a whole , the authorities estimate that 300,000 people have lost their jobs virtually overnight .
" it 's a shock - a brutal shock , " admitted denis kalundgi , the urbane mayor of likasi , surveying the town 's deeply potholed streets , now crowded with unemployed and frustrated men .
mr kalundgi said he was concerned that social tensions could quickly boil over .
" we 're suffering .
fifty per cent of the economy has gone .
for now , we are managing -lsb- to pay salaries -rsb- .
but only just . "
vulnerable families the world 's economic storm has hit dr congo just as this vast , dilapidated , conflict-ridden country was beginning to shrug off decades of turmoil and decline .
largely thanks to soaring mineral prices , the drc 's economy was projected to grow by up to 12 % last year .
around the continent as a whole , it was a similar story .
despite some glaring exceptions , africa has enjoyed a decade of impressive growth .
but today , adelard kihoho is discovering just how vulnerable the continent remains to a sudden downturn .
the 37-year-old mine worker lost his foundry job in december last year .
adelard kihoho has big family responsibilities " the foreign owners just told us to leave one day , " he said .
" i do n't know how long this will last .
before , i was earning about $ 250 a month , but now i am just trying to sell a few things on the street to survive . "
adelard has seven of his own children and two of his brother 's children to support .
they sleep together in a small , dark room on the outskirts of likasi .
with no welfare state to fall back on , adelard has been forced to make some painful choices since he lost his job .
since he can no longer afford to send all the children to school , seven-year-old naomi and three of her brothers now spend their days at home , waiting for the mines to reopen .
" they say the great powers are to blame for this , " said adelard .
" but it is we who are suffering . "
he wondered out loud whether " president obama can fix this " .
like many african countries , the drc is looking to the imf for urgent new loans to help it weather the current storm .
the g20 summit is expected to hear calls for at least $ 30bn in outside help for africa .
but grim as things are , it 's still possible to find optimists here .
defiantly upbeat it is a 20-minute helicopter ride from likasi to boss mining 's giant new copper and cobalt mine .
from the air , you can see where huge hills have been peeled and sliced apart by armies of mechanical diggers .
" it 's been really tough , " concedes gordon thompson , the chief operating officer of boss mining 's parent company , the british-registered central africa mining and exploration company .
work has come to a virtual standstill , but none of the workforce has been laid off .
the impact of the new mine is best seen from overhead " this is a very challenging environment .
but congo has to -lsb- bounce back -rsb- .
it does n't have an option , does it ?
we 're seeing it as an opportunity , " he says .
" we expect to be operating again in the next few weeks .
" our business will recover and grow , and it 's going to get stronger . "
he acknowledges congo 's need for a " leg-up " from the imf , but warns against " handouts " , saying : " the money will just be spent and we 'll be knocking at the door again for more in no time . "
back in likasi , mayor kalundgi is racing between meetings , trying to end a strike by unpaid railway workers .
but he , too , is defiantly upbeat .
" we did n't want this , but now it 's happened , we ca n't just fold our arms .
this crisis can have a positive effect , " he says .
" there is a need for foreign help , but there 's also the mobilisation of internal resources .
" we have learned a lesson from this - it 's made us realise that we ca n't just rely on copper and cobalt exports .
we need to diversify . "
warming to his theme , he speaks of persuading mining companies to start plant corn .
" the real problem we have right now is that we produce what we do n't consume and we do n't produce what we do consume .
we need to change this state of affairs throughout the country . "

" this is a very challenging environment .
but congo has to -lsb- bounce back -rsb- .
it does n't have an option , does it ?
we 're seeing it as an opportunity , " he says .
" we expect to be operating again in the next few weeks .
" our business will recover and grow , and it 's going to get stronger . "
he acknowledges congo 's need for a " leg-up " from the imf , but warns against " handouts " , saying : " the money will just be spent and we 'll be knocking at the door again for more in no time . "
back in likasi , mayor kalundgi is racing between meetings , trying to end a strike by unpaid railway workers .
but he , too , is defiantly upbeat .
" we did n't want this , but now it 's happened , we ca n't just fold our arms .
this crisis can have a positive effect , " he says .
" there is a need for foreign help , but there 's also the mobilisation of internal resources .
" we have learned a lesson from this - it 's made us realise that we ca n't just rely on copper and cobalt exports .
we need to diversify . "
warming to his theme , he speaks of persuading mining companies to start plant corn .
" the real problem we have right now is that we produce what we do n't consume and we do n't produce what we do consume .
we need to change this state of affairs throughout the country . "

the boards ' syllabuses were " over complicated " and gave students too many optional ways to obtain the qualifications .

ms tattersall said the qca was again reviewing the gcse science criteria with a view to new specifications -lrb- syllabuses -rrb- being in schools and colleges ready for first teaching in 2011 .
" science is a vitally important subject and it is essential that these new criteria and specifications should engage and challenge all learners , particularly the most able . "

the mathematics and english literature reports had been reassuring , concluding that standards had generally been maintained .
minor issues were being addressed .
ofqual said changes for 2009 include : • improved quality of questions , to stretch and challenge all students • work , including training for senior examiners , to improve objective tests -lrb- multiple choice -rrb- • tighter marking criteria to ensure that only the answers deserving of the marks are credited • some internal assessments revised to ensure better challenge to students schools minister jim knight accepted there was a " serious problem " with the gcse science exam .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme it was worth remembering , however , gcses tested a range of abilities from a * students to f-grade students , which was why some questions did not seem particularly challenging .

greg watson , chief executive of ocr , for example , said : " the report has little to do with standards or with content .

maths and english literature standards had been maintained but science was " clearly a cause for concern " , it said .
its evaluations involved not only the new general science gcses but also the separate physics gcse .
it is now going to check biology and chemistry .
the conservatives called it a " terrible indictment " of the government .
ministers said they were " concerned " . "
our monitoring shows that the revisions to the gcse science criteria in 2005 have led to a fall in the quality of science assessment " ofqual chair kathleen tattersall as england 's regulator ofqual looked at exams set by the three main england-based awarding bodies - but their exams are taken also by many pupils in wales and northern ireland and its findings have been copied to the equivalent bodies there .
it reported : " the results of our monitoring of the new gcse science specifications in 2007 and 2008 and the review of standards in gcse physics in 2007 raised significant causes for concern . "
' action taken ' ofqual 's chair , kathleen tattersall , said : " our monitoring shows that the revisions to the gcse science criteria in 2005 have led to a fall in the quality of science assessments . "
the boards ' syllabuses were " over complicated " and gave students too many optional ways to obtain the qualifications .
this had made it difficult to compare their achievements .
and there was too much emphasis on multiple choice questions , known as " objective tests . "
ms tattersall said the qca was again reviewing the gcse science criteria with a view to new specifications -lrb- syllabuses -rrb- being in schools and colleges ready for first teaching in 2011 .
" science is a vitally important subject and it is essential that these new criteria and specifications should engage and challenge all learners , particularly the most able . "
she added : " it is absolutely essential that standards remain consistent from year to year and across awarding bodies . "
the mathematics and english literature reports had been reassuring , concluding that standards had generally been maintained .
minor issues were being addressed .
ofqual said changes for 2009 include : • improved quality of questions , to stretch and challenge all students • work , including training for senior examiners , to improve objective tests -lrb- multiple choice -rrb- • tighter marking criteria to ensure that only the answers deserving of the marks are credited • some internal assessments revised to ensure better challenge to students schools minister jim knight accepted there was a " serious problem " with the gcse science exam .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme it was worth remembering , however , gcses tested a range of abilities from a * students to f-grade students , which was why some questions did not seem particularly challenging .
he also pointed out that although assessment was a problem , science learning was strong .
from the today programme more from today programme " just because we have a problem with the way the knowledge is being assessed , it does not mean the knowledge is not there , " he said .
critics of the changes to gcse science courses in 2005 warned even before they were implemented that they involved the " dumbing down " of the subject .
exam boards defended their position .
greg watson , chief executive of ocr , for example , said : " the report has little to do with standards or with content .
" it is mostly about whether the construction of the gcse allows exam boards to assess scientific skills and knowledge in the best way - given that society wants ' science for citizens ' and ' science for scientists ' taught at the same time . "
confidence shadow schools minister nick gibb said : " ofqual confirms that the government has devalued science exams . "
he added : " this is a terrible indictment of the government and the qca at a time when scientific education has never been so economically vital " .
teachers ' unions expressed concern that the reports might undermine confidence in the qualifications already gained by students .
the head of the association of school and college leaders , john dunford , said : " i am extremely concerned that the report on science gcse will damage the reputation of gcse generally . "
the headmasters ' and headmistresses ' conference of leading independent schools said the " damning verdict " helped to explain why so many were turning to the international gcse .
