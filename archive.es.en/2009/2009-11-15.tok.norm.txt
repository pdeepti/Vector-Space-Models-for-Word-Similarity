program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.11.2009 moderate arab islamists struggle to steer a democratic course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muslim brotherhood in egypt 's democratic efforts have borne the brunt of a government crackdown splits within the arab world ’ s foremost islamist opposition movement , the muslim brotherhood , with its ties to muslim communities in germany and elsewhere , could be signs that the group is not interested in democracy . for much of its 80-year history , the muslim brotherhood 's very name symbolized promotion of a violent , anti-western movement bent on strict imposition of islamic law .
much of the first generation of the current violent islamist movements trace their roots to the brotherhood and were inspired by the organization 's radical ideologues .
yet , for the past 30 years , the brotherhood 's loosely aligned chapters in various arab countries have participated in elections , shed secrecy for internal party democracy and justified the electoral path as their way forward .
when asked in 1980 after the fall of the shah of iran , whether the islamic revolution constituted a model for egypt , then muslim brotherhood leader omar el telmesani told this reporter : " no , our shah died in 1970 , " a reference to the late egyptian nationalist leader gamal abdel nasser .
but rather than encouraging the brotherhood 's more recent democratic inclinations , arab governments are cracking down in a move that threatens to widen the credibility gap between regimes and public opinion and could drive moderate islamists toward the movement ’ s radical jihad-preaching fringe .
in response to the brotherhood 's emergence from elections in 2005 as egypt 's main opposition group , the government of president hosni mubarak has constitutionally banned religion-based political parties , introduced legislation preventing muslim brothers from standing in elections as independent candidates and sought to cripple the movement by arresting hundreds of brothers , among them some of the brotherhood ’ s most moderate leaders . the crackdown comes amid growing speculation that the 81-year-old egyptian president is grooming his investment banker son gamal as his successor to run in next year 's presidential election . masters of black humor , many egyptians say they can tell how close they are to elections by the number of muslim brothers being detained .
relations between the government in jordan and the islamic action front , the brotherhood 's jordanian chapter , are hardly less adversarial and further complicated by the front 's close ties to hamas , the islamist palestinian brotherhood off-shoot that rules gaza .
hamas , which won a landslide victory in palestinian elections in 2006 , is seen by israel and the united states as a terrorist movement and feared by conservative arab leaders , including jordan 's king abdullah .
egypt and jordan , despite their repressive measures , have largely sought to control the brotherhood rather than drive it into exile as did tunisia or syria , where the military in 1982 crushed the brothers in an assault that left up to 10,000 people dead .
the toll of repression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim brotherhood supreme leader mohammed mehdi akef has said he will not stand for re-election the strain of the repression is , however , starting to take its toll on the brotherhood .
splits within the egyptian movement after supreme guide mohammed mahdi akef announced that he would not stand for re-election in january of next year have spilled onto the pages of the egyptian media .
conservatives in the movement blocked akef 's nomination of a leading reformer to the movement 's leadership council .
in jordan , muslim brothers argue over whether the jordanian and palestinian branches of the movement should be intertwined or operate as separate organizations with separate memberships . yet , the strengthening of conservative forces within more moderate muslim brotherhood affiliates has , so far at least , not undermined commitment to democratic principles .
if anything , the divisions within the secretive movement constitute milestone developments and reflect an internal recommitment to those principles .
for the first time , the brotherhood 's infighting is taking place in full view of the public with internal party debates feeding the front pages of local newspapers .
to officials in cairo , amman , riyadh and washington , the brotherhood 's internal turmoil and its failure to initiate a backlash against the repression constitutes an indication of the hard-line approach 's success .
but that could be deceptive .
" this is dangerously shortsighted .
it weakens the foundations of democracy as a whole … and has a corrosive effect on public freedoms , transparency and accountability , " marc lynch , an expert on the brotherhood at washington 's george washington university , told deutsche welle .
that , however , may well be the purpose of the crackdown .
" it is in the -lrb- egyptian -rrb- government 's advantage to keep the brotherhood ultra-conservative , " khalil al-anani , an egyptian expert on radical islam , told deutsche welle .
" the more democratic the group gets , the more popular it will become in the country . "
a role for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in europe have sought to embrace hamas as a moderate muslim brotherhood group some politicians and officials in europe , on the other hand , endorse the notion of embracing rather than repressing a moderate islamist brotherhood .
in a break with the conservative arab and us approach and in contrast to the european union 's blacklisting of hamas , parliamentarians from the uk , france , the netherlands and other european nations have this year met with hamas representatives .
moreover , german bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- intelligence officials this year helped mediate the release of hamas prisoners in israeli prisons in exchange for a video of israeli soldier gilad shalit , held captive by hamas since 2006 .
privately , several european officials and diplomats say they favor integration of moderate islamists into the political life of the arab world .
they note that the brothers in egypt and jordan are seeking non-violent ways to survive government repression .
in palestine , hamas , the only brotherhood group holding political office , is struggling to cater to the needs of 1.5 million mostly destitute palestinians under its rule .
prominent jordanian journalist rami khouri argues that contact with hamas , the muslim brothers and other marginalized groups in the middle east offers europe an opportunity to carve out a role for itself , particularly in the resolution of the israeli-palestinian conflict . " it is precisely the militants on both sides … who have to be brought into the talks for peace and coexistence , " he told deutsche welle .
" the castrated american political system lacks the ability to act with conviction on the really tough issues so as to talk to all actors ; europe is not so emasculated , and should avoid at all costs following the united states ' route to impotent self-marginalization , " khouri said .

the approval of slovenia , the fifth country to do so , brings russia closer to locking its control over the european gas supply .
south stream , which is estimated will cost 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- to build and is expected to be completed by 2015 , would run under the black sea to carry natural gas to western europe .
the european union has supported the construction of an alternative pipeline , known as nabucco , in an effort to counter russian monopolistic influence by importing gas from caspian sea nations like azerbijan and turkmenistan .
that project has been stalled , however , by a lack of supply agreements .
the politics of gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian claims the south stream line would ensure supplies by bypassing ukraine eu leaders have been pushing for more independence from russian natural gas since a dispute between moscow and kiev last january left many european homes without heat in the dead of winter .
about 80 percent of russian gas currently passes through ukraine , and russia has claimed the south stream line , which bypasses ukraine , would ensure a smoother supply .
another russian project , nord stream , would also bypass ukraine by piping gas to germany beneath the baltic sea .
denmark , sweden and finland have all given their approval to the project , meaning construction could start as soon as next year. acb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.11.2009 moderate arab islamists struggle to steer a democratic course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muslim brotherhood in egypt 's democratic efforts have borne the brunt of a government crackdown splits within the arab world ’ s foremost islamist opposition movement , the muslim brotherhood , with its ties to muslim communities in germany and elsewhere , could be signs that the group is not interested in democracy . for much of its 80-year history , the muslim brotherhood 's very name symbolized promotion of a violent , anti-western movement bent on strict imposition of islamic law .
much of the first generation of the current violent islamist movements trace their roots to the brotherhood and were inspired by the organization 's radical ideologues .
yet , for the past 30 years , the brotherhood 's loosely aligned chapters in various arab countries have participated in elections , shed secrecy for internal party democracy and justified the electoral path as their way forward .
when asked in 1980 after the fall of the shah of iran , whether the islamic revolution constituted a model for egypt , then muslim brotherhood leader omar el telmesani told this reporter : " no , our shah died in 1970 , " a reference to the late egyptian nationalist leader gamal abdel nasser .
but rather than encouraging the brotherhood 's more recent democratic inclinations , arab governments are cracking down in a move that threatens to widen the credibility gap between regimes and public opinion and could drive moderate islamists toward the movement ’ s radical jihad-preaching fringe .
in response to the brotherhood 's emergence from elections in 2005 as egypt 's main opposition group , the government of president hosni mubarak has constitutionally banned religion-based political parties , introduced legislation preventing muslim brothers from standing in elections as independent candidates and sought to cripple the movement by arresting hundreds of brothers , among them some of the brotherhood ’ s most moderate leaders . the crackdown comes amid growing speculation that the 81-year-old egyptian president is grooming his investment banker son gamal as his successor to run in next year 's presidential election . masters of black humor , many egyptians say they can tell how close they are to elections by the number of muslim brothers being detained .
relations between the government in jordan and the islamic action front , the brotherhood 's jordanian chapter , are hardly less adversarial and further complicated by the front 's close ties to hamas , the islamist palestinian brotherhood off-shoot that rules gaza .
hamas , which won a landslide victory in palestinian elections in 2006 , is seen by israel and the united states as a terrorist movement and feared by conservative arab leaders , including jordan 's king abdullah .
egypt and jordan , despite their repressive measures , have largely sought to control the brotherhood rather than drive it into exile as did tunisia or syria , where the military in 1982 crushed the brothers in an assault that left up to 10,000 people dead .
the toll of repression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim brotherhood supreme leader mohammed mehdi akef has said he will not stand for re-election the strain of the repression is , however , starting to take its toll on the brotherhood .
splits within the egyptian movement after supreme guide mohammed mahdi akef announced that he would not stand for re-election in january of next year have spilled onto the pages of the egyptian media .
conservatives in the movement blocked akef 's nomination of a leading reformer to the movement 's leadership council .
in jordan , muslim brothers argue over whether the jordanian and palestinian branches of the movement should be intertwined or operate as separate organizations with separate memberships . yet , the strengthening of conservative forces within more moderate muslim brotherhood affiliates has , so far at least , not undermined commitment to democratic principles .
if anything , the divisions within the secretive movement constitute milestone developments and reflect an internal recommitment to those principles .
for the first time , the brotherhood 's infighting is taking place in full view of the public with internal party debates feeding the front pages of local newspapers .
to officials in cairo , amman , riyadh and washington , the brotherhood 's internal turmoil and its failure to initiate a backlash against the repression constitutes an indication of the hard-line approach 's success .
but that could be deceptive .
" this is dangerously shortsighted .
it weakens the foundations of democracy as a whole … and has a corrosive effect on public freedoms , transparency and accountability , " marc lynch , an expert on the brotherhood at washington 's george washington university , told deutsche welle .
that , however , may well be the purpose of the crackdown .
" it is in the -lrb- egyptian -rrb- government 's advantage to keep the brotherhood ultra-conservative , " khalil al-anani , an egyptian expert on radical islam , told deutsche welle .
" the more democratic the group gets , the more popular it will become in the country . "
a role for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in europe have sought to embrace hamas as a moderate muslim brotherhood group some politicians and officials in europe , on the other hand , endorse the notion of embracing rather than repressing a moderate islamist brotherhood .
in a break with the conservative arab and us approach and in contrast to the european union 's blacklisting of hamas , parliamentarians from the uk , france , the netherlands and other european nations have this year met with hamas representatives .
moreover , german bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- intelligence officials this year helped mediate the release of hamas prisoners in israeli prisons in exchange for a video of israeli soldier gilad shalit , held captive by hamas since 2006 .
privately , several european officials and diplomats say they favor integration of moderate islamists into the political life of the arab world .
they note that the brothers in egypt and jordan are seeking non-violent ways to survive government repression .
in palestine , hamas , the only brotherhood group holding political office , is struggling to cater to the needs of 1.5 million mostly destitute palestinians under its rule .
prominent jordanian journalist rami khouri argues that contact with hamas , the muslim brothers and other marginalized groups in the middle east offers europe an opportunity to carve out a role for itself , particularly in the resolution of the israeli-palestinian conflict . " it is precisely the militants on both sides … who have to be brought into the talks for peace and coexistence , " he told deutsche welle .
" the castrated american political system lacks the ability to act with conviction on the really tough issues so as to talk to all actors ; europe is not so emasculated , and should avoid at all costs following the united states ' route to impotent self-marginalization , " khouri said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 15.11.2009 kosovo elects new mayors , town councils in first election after independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these local elections are seen as critical for the newly independent kosovo in kosovo , voters have gone to the polls in the first election organized after the breakaway serbian province declared independence in 2008 .
observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .

observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 15.11.2009 kosovo elects new mayors , town councils in first election after independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these local elections are seen as critical for the newly independent kosovo in kosovo , voters have gone to the polls in the first election organized after the breakaway serbian province declared independence in 2008 .
observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .
these elections are the first ones where we have a local election not centered on the cause of independence , " deda said .
" it is about normal things , better public services , economic development , issues other countries campaign about . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation is " very favorable " according to nato last monday , new zealand became the 63rd country to recognize kosovo 's independence .
the united states and most of the european union also recognize kosovo although serbia 's traditional ally , russia , does not .
these elections are also important for kosovo 's international stature since belgrade is challenging the legality of kosovo 's independence at the international court of justice , where hearings are set to begin on december 1 .

on sunday , us president barack obama and other world leaders attending the apec conference in singapore showed support for delaying such a binding pact until a later time .
the copenhagen summit will seek to draw up a successor to the kyoto protocol on climate change .
danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen , who flew to singapore to address leaders at the asia-pacific meeting , proposed a compromise that would call for continued negotiations and set a deadline for their conclusion .
" given the time factor and the situation of individual countries , we must in the coming weeks focus on what is possible and not let ourselves be distracted by what is not possible , " rasmussen said at the meeting .
rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels add urgency to achieving an agreement on carbon emissions a major obstacle to reaching a binding agreement by next month is a disagreement between developed and developing countries .
chinese president hu jintao , while not explicitly backing a delay for a binding agreement , instead emphasized the need for wealthy nations to give financial support to developing nations who can not fight climate change on their own .
as news of support for a delay spread , environmental activists and other world leaders denounced the idea .
the environmental lobby group wwf released a statement saying the delay " does not look like a smart startegy to win the fight against climate change . "
french environment minister jean-louis borloo took aim specifically at the united states on sunday , saying washington is the main obstacle to reaching a binding agreement in copenhagen .
" -lrb- the united states is -rrb- the biggest per capita emitter and it 's saying ' i 'd like to but i ca n't . '
that 's the issue , " he said. acb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .

however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.11.2009 moderate arab islamists struggle to steer a democratic course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muslim brotherhood in egypt 's democratic efforts have borne the brunt of a government crackdown splits within the arab world ’ s foremost islamist opposition movement , the muslim brotherhood , with its ties to muslim communities in germany and elsewhere , could be signs that the group is not interested in democracy . for much of its 80-year history , the muslim brotherhood 's very name symbolized promotion of a violent , anti-western movement bent on strict imposition of islamic law .
much of the first generation of the current violent islamist movements trace their roots to the brotherhood and were inspired by the organization 's radical ideologues .
yet , for the past 30 years , the brotherhood 's loosely aligned chapters in various arab countries have participated in elections , shed secrecy for internal party democracy and justified the electoral path as their way forward .
when asked in 1980 after the fall of the shah of iran , whether the islamic revolution constituted a model for egypt , then muslim brotherhood leader omar el telmesani told this reporter : " no , our shah died in 1970 , " a reference to the late egyptian nationalist leader gamal abdel nasser .
but rather than encouraging the brotherhood 's more recent democratic inclinations , arab governments are cracking down in a move that threatens to widen the credibility gap between regimes and public opinion and could drive moderate islamists toward the movement ’ s radical jihad-preaching fringe .
in response to the brotherhood 's emergence from elections in 2005 as egypt 's main opposition group , the government of president hosni mubarak has constitutionally banned religion-based political parties , introduced legislation preventing muslim brothers from standing in elections as independent candidates and sought to cripple the movement by arresting hundreds of brothers , among them some of the brotherhood ’ s most moderate leaders . the crackdown comes amid growing speculation that the 81-year-old egyptian president is grooming his investment banker son gamal as his successor to run in next year 's presidential election . masters of black humor , many egyptians say they can tell how close they are to elections by the number of muslim brothers being detained .
relations between the government in jordan and the islamic action front , the brotherhood 's jordanian chapter , are hardly less adversarial and further complicated by the front 's close ties to hamas , the islamist palestinian brotherhood off-shoot that rules gaza .
hamas , which won a landslide victory in palestinian elections in 2006 , is seen by israel and the united states as a terrorist movement and feared by conservative arab leaders , including jordan 's king abdullah .
egypt and jordan , despite their repressive measures , have largely sought to control the brotherhood rather than drive it into exile as did tunisia or syria , where the military in 1982 crushed the brothers in an assault that left up to 10,000 people dead .
the toll of repression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim brotherhood supreme leader mohammed mehdi akef has said he will not stand for re-election the strain of the repression is , however , starting to take its toll on the brotherhood .
splits within the egyptian movement after supreme guide mohammed mahdi akef announced that he would not stand for re-election in january of next year have spilled onto the pages of the egyptian media .
conservatives in the movement blocked akef 's nomination of a leading reformer to the movement 's leadership council .
in jordan , muslim brothers argue over whether the jordanian and palestinian branches of the movement should be intertwined or operate as separate organizations with separate memberships . yet , the strengthening of conservative forces within more moderate muslim brotherhood affiliates has , so far at least , not undermined commitment to democratic principles .
if anything , the divisions within the secretive movement constitute milestone developments and reflect an internal recommitment to those principles .
for the first time , the brotherhood 's infighting is taking place in full view of the public with internal party debates feeding the front pages of local newspapers .
to officials in cairo , amman , riyadh and washington , the brotherhood 's internal turmoil and its failure to initiate a backlash against the repression constitutes an indication of the hard-line approach 's success .
but that could be deceptive .
" this is dangerously shortsighted .
it weakens the foundations of democracy as a whole … and has a corrosive effect on public freedoms , transparency and accountability , " marc lynch , an expert on the brotherhood at washington 's george washington university , told deutsche welle .
that , however , may well be the purpose of the crackdown .
" it is in the -lrb- egyptian -rrb- government 's advantage to keep the brotherhood ultra-conservative , " khalil al-anani , an egyptian expert on radical islam , told deutsche welle .
" the more democratic the group gets , the more popular it will become in the country . "
a role for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in europe have sought to embrace hamas as a moderate muslim brotherhood group some politicians and officials in europe , on the other hand , endorse the notion of embracing rather than repressing a moderate islamist brotherhood .
in a break with the conservative arab and us approach and in contrast to the european union 's blacklisting of hamas , parliamentarians from the uk , france , the netherlands and other european nations have this year met with hamas representatives .
moreover , german bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- intelligence officials this year helped mediate the release of hamas prisoners in israeli prisons in exchange for a video of israeli soldier gilad shalit , held captive by hamas since 2006 .
privately , several european officials and diplomats say they favor integration of moderate islamists into the political life of the arab world .
they note that the brothers in egypt and jordan are seeking non-violent ways to survive government repression .
in palestine , hamas , the only brotherhood group holding political office , is struggling to cater to the needs of 1.5 million mostly destitute palestinians under its rule .
prominent jordanian journalist rami khouri argues that contact with hamas , the muslim brothers and other marginalized groups in the middle east offers europe an opportunity to carve out a role for itself , particularly in the resolution of the israeli-palestinian conflict . " it is precisely the militants on both sides … who have to be brought into the talks for peace and coexistence , " he told deutsche welle .
" the castrated american political system lacks the ability to act with conviction on the really tough issues so as to talk to all actors ; europe is not so emasculated , and should avoid at all costs following the united states ' route to impotent self-marginalization , " khouri said .

much of the first generation of the current violent islamist movements trace their roots to the brotherhood and were inspired by the organization 's radical ideologues .
yet , for the past 30 years , the brotherhood 's loosely aligned chapters in various arab countries have participated in elections , shed secrecy for internal party democracy and justified the electoral path as their way forward .
when asked in 1980 after the fall of the shah of iran , whether the islamic revolution constituted a model for egypt , then muslim brotherhood leader omar el telmesani told this reporter : " no , our shah died in 1970 , " a reference to the late egyptian nationalist leader gamal abdel nasser .
but rather than encouraging the brotherhood 's more recent democratic inclinations , arab governments are cracking down in a move that threatens to widen the credibility gap between regimes and public opinion and could drive moderate islamists toward the movement ’ s radical jihad-preaching fringe .
in response to the brotherhood 's emergence from elections in 2005 as egypt 's main opposition group , the government of president hosni mubarak has constitutionally banned religion-based political parties , introduced legislation preventing muslim brothers from standing in elections as independent candidates and sought to cripple the movement by arresting hundreds of brothers , among them some of the brotherhood ’ s most moderate leaders . the crackdown comes amid growing speculation that the 81-year-old egyptian president is grooming his investment banker son gamal as his successor to run in next year 's presidential election . masters of black humor , many egyptians say they can tell how close they are to elections by the number of muslim brothers being detained .
relations between the government in jordan and the islamic action front , the brotherhood 's jordanian chapter , are hardly less adversarial and further complicated by the front 's close ties to hamas , the islamist palestinian brotherhood off-shoot that rules gaza .
hamas , which won a landslide victory in palestinian elections in 2006 , is seen by israel and the united states as a terrorist movement and feared by conservative arab leaders , including jordan 's king abdullah .
egypt and jordan , despite their repressive measures , have largely sought to control the brotherhood rather than drive it into exile as did tunisia or syria , where the military in 1982 crushed the brothers in an assault that left up to 10,000 people dead .
the toll of repression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim brotherhood supreme leader mohammed mehdi akef has said he will not stand for re-election the strain of the repression is , however , starting to take its toll on the brotherhood .
splits within the egyptian movement after supreme guide mohammed mahdi akef announced that he would not stand for re-election in january of next year have spilled onto the pages of the egyptian media .
conservatives in the movement blocked akef 's nomination of a leading reformer to the movement 's leadership council .
in jordan , muslim brothers argue over whether the jordanian and palestinian branches of the movement should be intertwined or operate as separate organizations with separate memberships . yet , the strengthening of conservative forces within more moderate muslim brotherhood affiliates has , so far at least , not undermined commitment to democratic principles .
if anything , the divisions within the secretive movement constitute milestone developments and reflect an internal recommitment to those principles .
for the first time , the brotherhood 's infighting is taking place in full view of the public with internal party debates feeding the front pages of local newspapers .
to officials in cairo , amman , riyadh and washington , the brotherhood 's internal turmoil and its failure to initiate a backlash against the repression constitutes an indication of the hard-line approach 's success .
but that could be deceptive .
" this is dangerously shortsighted .
it weakens the foundations of democracy as a whole … and has a corrosive effect on public freedoms , transparency and accountability , " marc lynch , an expert on the brotherhood at washington 's george washington university , told deutsche welle .
that , however , may well be the purpose of the crackdown .
" it is in the -lrb- egyptian -rrb- government 's advantage to keep the brotherhood ultra-conservative , " khalil al-anani , an egyptian expert on radical islam , told deutsche welle .
" the more democratic the group gets , the more popular it will become in the country . "
a role for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in europe have sought to embrace hamas as a moderate muslim brotherhood group some politicians and officials in europe , on the other hand , endorse the notion of embracing rather than repressing a moderate islamist brotherhood .
in a break with the conservative arab and us approach and in contrast to the european union 's blacklisting of hamas , parliamentarians from the uk , france , the netherlands and other european nations have this year met with hamas representatives .
moreover , german bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- intelligence officials this year helped mediate the release of hamas prisoners in israeli prisons in exchange for a video of israeli soldier gilad shalit , held captive by hamas since 2006 .
privately , several european officials and diplomats say they favor integration of moderate islamists into the political life of the arab world .
they note that the brothers in egypt and jordan are seeking non-violent ways to survive government repression .
in palestine , hamas , the only brotherhood group holding political office , is struggling to cater to the needs of 1.5 million mostly destitute palestinians under its rule .
prominent jordanian journalist rami khouri argues that contact with hamas , the muslim brothers and other marginalized groups in the middle east offers europe an opportunity to carve out a role for itself , particularly in the resolution of the israeli-palestinian conflict . " it is precisely the militants on both sides … who have to be brought into the talks for peace and coexistence , " he told deutsche welle .
" the castrated american political system lacks the ability to act with conviction on the really tough issues so as to talk to all actors ; europe is not so emasculated , and should avoid at all costs following the united states ' route to impotent self-marginalization , " khouri said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 15.11.2009 kosovo elects new mayors , town councils in first election after independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these local elections are seen as critical for the newly independent kosovo in kosovo , voters have gone to the polls in the first election organized after the breakaway serbian province declared independence in 2008 .
observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .
these elections are the first ones where we have a local election not centered on the cause of independence , " deda said .
" it is about normal things , better public services , economic development , issues other countries campaign about . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation is " very favorable " according to nato last monday , new zealand became the 63rd country to recognize kosovo 's independence .
the united states and most of the european union also recognize kosovo although serbia 's traditional ally , russia , does not .
these elections are also important for kosovo 's international stature since belgrade is challenging the legality of kosovo 's independence at the international court of justice , where hearings are set to begin on december 1 .

on sunday , us president barack obama and other world leaders attending the apec conference in singapore showed support for delaying such a binding pact until a later time .
the copenhagen summit will seek to draw up a successor to the kyoto protocol on climate change .
danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen , who flew to singapore to address leaders at the asia-pacific meeting , proposed a compromise that would call for continued negotiations and set a deadline for their conclusion .
" given the time factor and the situation of individual countries , we must in the coming weeks focus on what is possible and not let ourselves be distracted by what is not possible , " rasmussen said at the meeting .

chinese president hu jintao , while not explicitly backing a delay for a binding agreement , instead emphasized the need for wealthy nations to give financial support to developing nations who can not fight climate change on their own .
as news of support for a delay spread , environmental activists and other world leaders denounced the idea .
the environmental lobby group wwf released a statement saying the delay " does not look like a smart startegy to win the fight against climate change . "
french environment minister jean-louis borloo took aim specifically at the united states on sunday , saying washington is the main obstacle to reaching a binding agreement in copenhagen .
" -lrb- the united states is -rrb- the biggest per capita emitter and it 's saying ' i 'd like to but i ca n't . '

the approval of slovenia , the fifth country to do so , brings russia closer to locking its control over the european gas supply .
south stream , which is estimated will cost 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- to build and is expected to be completed by 2015 , would run under the black sea to carry natural gas to western europe .
the european union has supported the construction of an alternative pipeline , known as nabucco , in an effort to counter russian monopolistic influence by importing gas from caspian sea nations like azerbijan and turkmenistan .
that project has been stalled , however , by a lack of supply agreements .
the politics of gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian claims the south stream line would ensure supplies by bypassing ukraine eu leaders have been pushing for more independence from russian natural gas since a dispute between moscow and kiev last january left many european homes without heat in the dead of winter .
about 80 percent of russian gas currently passes through ukraine , and russia has claimed the south stream line , which bypasses ukraine , would ensure a smoother supply .
another russian project , nord stream , would also bypass ukraine by piping gas to germany beneath the baltic sea .
denmark , sweden and finland have all given their approval to the project , meaning construction could start as soon as next year. acb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , us president barack obama and other world leaders attending the apec conference in singapore showed support for delaying such a binding pact until a later time .
the copenhagen summit will seek to draw up a successor to the kyoto protocol on climate change .
danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen , who flew to singapore to address leaders at the asia-pacific meeting , proposed a compromise that would call for continued negotiations and set a deadline for their conclusion .
" given the time factor and the situation of individual countries , we must in the coming weeks focus on what is possible and not let ourselves be distracted by what is not possible , " rasmussen said at the meeting .
rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels add urgency to achieving an agreement on carbon emissions a major obstacle to reaching a binding agreement by next month is a disagreement between developed and developing countries .
chinese president hu jintao , while not explicitly backing a delay for a binding agreement , instead emphasized the need for wealthy nations to give financial support to developing nations who can not fight climate change on their own .
as news of support for a delay spread , environmental activists and other world leaders denounced the idea .
the environmental lobby group wwf released a statement saying the delay " does not look like a smart startegy to win the fight against climate change . "
french environment minister jean-louis borloo took aim specifically at the united states on sunday , saying washington is the main obstacle to reaching a binding agreement in copenhagen .
" -lrb- the united states is -rrb- the biggest per capita emitter and it 's saying ' i 'd like to but i ca n't . '
that 's the issue , " he said. acb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday , us president barack obama and other world leaders attending the apec conference in singapore showed support for delaying such a binding pact until a later time .
the copenhagen summit will seek to draw up a successor to the kyoto protocol on climate change .
danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen , who flew to singapore to address leaders at the asia-pacific meeting , proposed a compromise that would call for continued negotiations and set a deadline for their conclusion .
" given the time factor and the situation of individual countries , we must in the coming weeks focus on what is possible and not let ourselves be distracted by what is not possible , " rasmussen said at the meeting .
rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels add urgency to achieving an agreement on carbon emissions a major obstacle to reaching a binding agreement by next month is a disagreement between developed and developing countries .
chinese president hu jintao , while not explicitly backing a delay for a binding agreement , instead emphasized the need for wealthy nations to give financial support to developing nations who can not fight climate change on their own .
as news of support for a delay spread , environmental activists and other world leaders denounced the idea .
the environmental lobby group wwf released a statement saying the delay " does not look like a smart startegy to win the fight against climate change . "
french environment minister jean-louis borloo took aim specifically at the united states on sunday , saying washington is the main obstacle to reaching a binding agreement in copenhagen .
" -lrb- the united states is -rrb- the biggest per capita emitter and it 's saying ' i 'd like to but i ca n't . '
that 's the issue , " he said. acb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the approval of slovenia , the fifth country to do so , brings russia closer to locking its control over the european gas supply .
south stream , which is estimated will cost 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- to build and is expected to be completed by 2015 , would run under the black sea to carry natural gas to western europe .
the european union has supported the construction of an alternative pipeline , known as nabucco , in an effort to counter russian monopolistic influence by importing gas from caspian sea nations like azerbijan and turkmenistan .
that project has been stalled , however , by a lack of supply agreements .
the politics of gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian claims the south stream line would ensure supplies by bypassing ukraine eu leaders have been pushing for more independence from russian natural gas since a dispute between moscow and kiev last january left many european homes without heat in the dead of winter .
about 80 percent of russian gas currently passes through ukraine , and russia has claimed the south stream line , which bypasses ukraine , would ensure a smoother supply .
another russian project , nord stream , would also bypass ukraine by piping gas to germany beneath the baltic sea .
denmark , sweden and finland have all given their approval to the project , meaning construction could start as soon as next year. acb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.11.2009 moderate arab islamists struggle to steer a democratic course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muslim brotherhood in egypt 's democratic efforts have borne the brunt of a government crackdown splits within the arab world ’ s foremost islamist opposition movement , the muslim brotherhood , with its ties to muslim communities in germany and elsewhere , could be signs that the group is not interested in democracy . for much of its 80-year history , the muslim brotherhood 's very name symbolized promotion of a violent , anti-western movement bent on strict imposition of islamic law .
much of the first generation of the current violent islamist movements trace their roots to the brotherhood and were inspired by the organization 's radical ideologues .
yet , for the past 30 years , the brotherhood 's loosely aligned chapters in various arab countries have participated in elections , shed secrecy for internal party democracy and justified the electoral path as their way forward .
when asked in 1980 after the fall of the shah of iran , whether the islamic revolution constituted a model for egypt , then muslim brotherhood leader omar el telmesani told this reporter : " no , our shah died in 1970 , " a reference to the late egyptian nationalist leader gamal abdel nasser .
but rather than encouraging the brotherhood 's more recent democratic inclinations , arab governments are cracking down in a move that threatens to widen the credibility gap between regimes and public opinion and could drive moderate islamists toward the movement ’ s radical jihad-preaching fringe .
in response to the brotherhood 's emergence from elections in 2005 as egypt 's main opposition group , the government of president hosni mubarak has constitutionally banned religion-based political parties , introduced legislation preventing muslim brothers from standing in elections as independent candidates and sought to cripple the movement by arresting hundreds of brothers , among them some of the brotherhood ’ s most moderate leaders . the crackdown comes amid growing speculation that the 81-year-old egyptian president is grooming his investment banker son gamal as his successor to run in next year 's presidential election . masters of black humor , many egyptians say they can tell how close they are to elections by the number of muslim brothers being detained .
relations between the government in jordan and the islamic action front , the brotherhood 's jordanian chapter , are hardly less adversarial and further complicated by the front 's close ties to hamas , the islamist palestinian brotherhood off-shoot that rules gaza .
hamas , which won a landslide victory in palestinian elections in 2006 , is seen by israel and the united states as a terrorist movement and feared by conservative arab leaders , including jordan 's king abdullah .
egypt and jordan , despite their repressive measures , have largely sought to control the brotherhood rather than drive it into exile as did tunisia or syria , where the military in 1982 crushed the brothers in an assault that left up to 10,000 people dead .
the toll of repression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim brotherhood supreme leader mohammed mehdi akef has said he will not stand for re-election the strain of the repression is , however , starting to take its toll on the brotherhood .
splits within the egyptian movement after supreme guide mohammed mahdi akef announced that he would not stand for re-election in january of next year have spilled onto the pages of the egyptian media .
conservatives in the movement blocked akef 's nomination of a leading reformer to the movement 's leadership council .
in jordan , muslim brothers argue over whether the jordanian and palestinian branches of the movement should be intertwined or operate as separate organizations with separate memberships . yet , the strengthening of conservative forces within more moderate muslim brotherhood affiliates has , so far at least , not undermined commitment to democratic principles .
if anything , the divisions within the secretive movement constitute milestone developments and reflect an internal recommitment to those principles .
for the first time , the brotherhood 's infighting is taking place in full view of the public with internal party debates feeding the front pages of local newspapers .
to officials in cairo , amman , riyadh and washington , the brotherhood 's internal turmoil and its failure to initiate a backlash against the repression constitutes an indication of the hard-line approach 's success .
but that could be deceptive .
" this is dangerously shortsighted .
it weakens the foundations of democracy as a whole … and has a corrosive effect on public freedoms , transparency and accountability , " marc lynch , an expert on the brotherhood at washington 's george washington university , told deutsche welle .
that , however , may well be the purpose of the crackdown .
" it is in the -lrb- egyptian -rrb- government 's advantage to keep the brotherhood ultra-conservative , " khalil al-anani , an egyptian expert on radical islam , told deutsche welle .
" the more democratic the group gets , the more popular it will become in the country . "
a role for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in europe have sought to embrace hamas as a moderate muslim brotherhood group some politicians and officials in europe , on the other hand , endorse the notion of embracing rather than repressing a moderate islamist brotherhood .
in a break with the conservative arab and us approach and in contrast to the european union 's blacklisting of hamas , parliamentarians from the uk , france , the netherlands and other european nations have this year met with hamas representatives .
moreover , german bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- intelligence officials this year helped mediate the release of hamas prisoners in israeli prisons in exchange for a video of israeli soldier gilad shalit , held captive by hamas since 2006 .
privately , several european officials and diplomats say they favor integration of moderate islamists into the political life of the arab world .
they note that the brothers in egypt and jordan are seeking non-violent ways to survive government repression .
in palestine , hamas , the only brotherhood group holding political office , is struggling to cater to the needs of 1.5 million mostly destitute palestinians under its rule .
prominent jordanian journalist rami khouri argues that contact with hamas , the muslim brothers and other marginalized groups in the middle east offers europe an opportunity to carve out a role for itself , particularly in the resolution of the israeli-palestinian conflict . " it is precisely the militants on both sides … who have to be brought into the talks for peace and coexistence , " he told deutsche welle .
" the castrated american political system lacks the ability to act with conviction on the really tough issues so as to talk to all actors ; europe is not so emasculated , and should avoid at all costs following the united states ' route to impotent self-marginalization , " khouri said .

the approval of slovenia , the fifth country to do so , brings russia closer to locking its control over the european gas supply .
south stream , which is estimated will cost 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- to build and is expected to be completed by 2015 , would run under the black sea to carry natural gas to western europe .
the european union has supported the construction of an alternative pipeline , known as nabucco , in an effort to counter russian monopolistic influence by importing gas from caspian sea nations like azerbijan and turkmenistan .
that project has been stalled , however , by a lack of supply agreements .
the politics of gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian claims the south stream line would ensure supplies by bypassing ukraine eu leaders have been pushing for more independence from russian natural gas since a dispute between moscow and kiev last january left many european homes without heat in the dead of winter .
about 80 percent of russian gas currently passes through ukraine , and russia has claimed the south stream line , which bypasses ukraine , would ensure a smoother supply .
another russian project , nord stream , would also bypass ukraine by piping gas to germany beneath the baltic sea .
denmark , sweden and finland have all given their approval to the project , meaning construction could start as soon as next year. acb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .
these elections are the first ones where we have a local election not centered on the cause of independence , " deda said .
" it is about normal things , better public services , economic development , issues other countries campaign about . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation is " very favorable " according to nato last monday , new zealand became the 63rd country to recognize kosovo 's independence .
the united states and most of the european union also recognize kosovo although serbia 's traditional ally , russia , does not .
these elections are also important for kosovo 's international stature since belgrade is challenging the legality of kosovo 's independence at the international court of justice , where hearings are set to begin on december 1 .

" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .
these elections are the first ones where we have a local election not centered on the cause of independence , " deda said .
" it is about normal things , better public services , economic development , issues other countries campaign about . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation is " very favorable " according to nato last monday , new zealand became the 63rd country to recognize kosovo 's independence .
the united states and most of the european union also recognize kosovo although serbia 's traditional ally , russia , does not .
these elections are also important for kosovo 's international stature since belgrade is challenging the legality of kosovo 's independence at the international court of justice , where hearings are set to begin on december 1 .

on sunday , us president barack obama and other world leaders attending the apec conference in singapore showed support for delaying such a binding pact until a later time .
the copenhagen summit will seek to draw up a successor to the kyoto protocol on climate change .
danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen , who flew to singapore to address leaders at the asia-pacific meeting , proposed a compromise that would call for continued negotiations and set a deadline for their conclusion .
" given the time factor and the situation of individual countries , we must in the coming weeks focus on what is possible and not let ourselves be distracted by what is not possible , " rasmussen said at the meeting .
rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels add urgency to achieving an agreement on carbon emissions a major obstacle to reaching a binding agreement by next month is a disagreement between developed and developing countries .
chinese president hu jintao , while not explicitly backing a delay for a binding agreement , instead emphasized the need for wealthy nations to give financial support to developing nations who can not fight climate change on their own .
as news of support for a delay spread , environmental activists and other world leaders denounced the idea .
the environmental lobby group wwf released a statement saying the delay " does not look like a smart startegy to win the fight against climate change . "
french environment minister jean-louis borloo took aim specifically at the united states on sunday , saying washington is the main obstacle to reaching a binding agreement in copenhagen .
" -lrb- the united states is -rrb- the biggest per capita emitter and it 's saying ' i 'd like to but i ca n't . '

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 15.11.2009 kosovo elects new mayors , town councils in first election after independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these local elections are seen as critical for the newly independent kosovo in kosovo , voters have gone to the polls in the first election organized after the breakaway serbian province declared independence in 2008 .
observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .
these elections are the first ones where we have a local election not centered on the cause of independence , " deda said .
" it is about normal things , better public services , economic development , issues other countries campaign about . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation is " very favorable " according to nato last monday , new zealand became the 63rd country to recognize kosovo 's independence .
the united states and most of the european union also recognize kosovo although serbia 's traditional ally , russia , does not .
these elections are also important for kosovo 's international stature since belgrade is challenging the legality of kosovo 's independence at the international court of justice , where hearings are set to begin on december 1 .

rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels add urgency to achieving an agreement on carbon emissions a major obstacle to reaching a binding agreement by next month is a disagreement between developed and developing countries .
chinese president hu jintao , while not explicitly backing a delay for a binding agreement , instead emphasized the need for wealthy nations to give financial support to developing nations who can not fight climate change on their own .
as news of support for a delay spread , environmental activists and other world leaders denounced the idea .
the environmental lobby group wwf released a statement saying the delay " does not look like a smart startegy to win the fight against climate change . "
french environment minister jean-louis borloo took aim specifically at the united states on sunday , saying washington is the main obstacle to reaching a binding agreement in copenhagen .
" -lrb- the united states is -rrb- the biggest per capita emitter and it 's saying ' i 'd like to but i ca n't . '
that 's the issue , " he said. acb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .
these elections are the first ones where we have a local election not centered on the cause of independence , " deda said .
" it is about normal things , better public services , economic development , issues other countries campaign about . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation is " very favorable " according to nato last monday , new zealand became the 63rd country to recognize kosovo 's independence .
the united states and most of the european union also recognize kosovo although serbia 's traditional ally , russia , does not .
these elections are also important for kosovo 's international stature since belgrade is challenging the legality of kosovo 's independence at the international court of justice , where hearings are set to begin on december 1 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.11.2009 moderate arab islamists struggle to steer a democratic course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muslim brotherhood in egypt 's democratic efforts have borne the brunt of a government crackdown splits within the arab world ’ s foremost islamist opposition movement , the muslim brotherhood , with its ties to muslim communities in germany and elsewhere , could be signs that the group is not interested in democracy . for much of its 80-year history , the muslim brotherhood 's very name symbolized promotion of a violent , anti-western movement bent on strict imposition of islamic law .
much of the first generation of the current violent islamist movements trace their roots to the brotherhood and were inspired by the organization 's radical ideologues .
yet , for the past 30 years , the brotherhood 's loosely aligned chapters in various arab countries have participated in elections , shed secrecy for internal party democracy and justified the electoral path as their way forward .
when asked in 1980 after the fall of the shah of iran , whether the islamic revolution constituted a model for egypt , then muslim brotherhood leader omar el telmesani told this reporter : " no , our shah died in 1970 , " a reference to the late egyptian nationalist leader gamal abdel nasser .
but rather than encouraging the brotherhood 's more recent democratic inclinations , arab governments are cracking down in a move that threatens to widen the credibility gap between regimes and public opinion and could drive moderate islamists toward the movement ’ s radical jihad-preaching fringe .
in response to the brotherhood 's emergence from elections in 2005 as egypt 's main opposition group , the government of president hosni mubarak has constitutionally banned religion-based political parties , introduced legislation preventing muslim brothers from standing in elections as independent candidates and sought to cripple the movement by arresting hundreds of brothers , among them some of the brotherhood ’ s most moderate leaders . the crackdown comes amid growing speculation that the 81-year-old egyptian president is grooming his investment banker son gamal as his successor to run in next year 's presidential election . masters of black humor , many egyptians say they can tell how close they are to elections by the number of muslim brothers being detained .
relations between the government in jordan and the islamic action front , the brotherhood 's jordanian chapter , are hardly less adversarial and further complicated by the front 's close ties to hamas , the islamist palestinian brotherhood off-shoot that rules gaza .
hamas , which won a landslide victory in palestinian elections in 2006 , is seen by israel and the united states as a terrorist movement and feared by conservative arab leaders , including jordan 's king abdullah .
egypt and jordan , despite their repressive measures , have largely sought to control the brotherhood rather than drive it into exile as did tunisia or syria , where the military in 1982 crushed the brothers in an assault that left up to 10,000 people dead .
the toll of repression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim brotherhood supreme leader mohammed mehdi akef has said he will not stand for re-election the strain of the repression is , however , starting to take its toll on the brotherhood .
splits within the egyptian movement after supreme guide mohammed mahdi akef announced that he would not stand for re-election in january of next year have spilled onto the pages of the egyptian media .
conservatives in the movement blocked akef 's nomination of a leading reformer to the movement 's leadership council .
in jordan , muslim brothers argue over whether the jordanian and palestinian branches of the movement should be intertwined or operate as separate organizations with separate memberships . yet , the strengthening of conservative forces within more moderate muslim brotherhood affiliates has , so far at least , not undermined commitment to democratic principles .
if anything , the divisions within the secretive movement constitute milestone developments and reflect an internal recommitment to those principles .
for the first time , the brotherhood 's infighting is taking place in full view of the public with internal party debates feeding the front pages of local newspapers .
to officials in cairo , amman , riyadh and washington , the brotherhood 's internal turmoil and its failure to initiate a backlash against the repression constitutes an indication of the hard-line approach 's success .
but that could be deceptive .
" this is dangerously shortsighted .

a role for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians in europe have sought to embrace hamas as a moderate muslim brotherhood group some politicians and officials in europe , on the other hand , endorse the notion of embracing rather than repressing a moderate islamist brotherhood .
in a break with the conservative arab and us approach and in contrast to the european union 's blacklisting of hamas , parliamentarians from the uk , france , the netherlands and other european nations have this year met with hamas representatives .
moreover , german bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- intelligence officials this year helped mediate the release of hamas prisoners in israeli prisons in exchange for a video of israeli soldier gilad shalit , held captive by hamas since 2006 .
privately , several european officials and diplomats say they favor integration of moderate islamists into the political life of the arab world .
they note that the brothers in egypt and jordan are seeking non-violent ways to survive government repression .
in palestine , hamas , the only brotherhood group holding political office , is struggling to cater to the needs of 1.5 million mostly destitute palestinians under its rule .
prominent jordanian journalist rami khouri argues that contact with hamas , the muslim brothers and other marginalized groups in the middle east offers europe an opportunity to carve out a role for itself , particularly in the resolution of the israeli-palestinian conflict . " it is precisely the militants on both sides … who have to be brought into the talks for peace and coexistence , " he told deutsche welle .
" the castrated american political system lacks the ability to act with conviction on the really tough issues so as to talk to all actors ; europe is not so emasculated , and should avoid at all costs following the united states ' route to impotent self-marginalization , " khouri said .

much of the first generation of the current violent islamist movements trace their roots to the brotherhood and were inspired by the organization 's radical ideologues .
yet , for the past 30 years , the brotherhood 's loosely aligned chapters in various arab countries have participated in elections , shed secrecy for internal party democracy and justified the electoral path as their way forward .
when asked in 1980 after the fall of the shah of iran , whether the islamic revolution constituted a model for egypt , then muslim brotherhood leader omar el telmesani told this reporter : " no , our shah died in 1970 , " a reference to the late egyptian nationalist leader gamal abdel nasser .
but rather than encouraging the brotherhood 's more recent democratic inclinations , arab governments are cracking down in a move that threatens to widen the credibility gap between regimes and public opinion and could drive moderate islamists toward the movement ’ s radical jihad-preaching fringe .
in response to the brotherhood 's emergence from elections in 2005 as egypt 's main opposition group , the government of president hosni mubarak has constitutionally banned religion-based political parties , introduced legislation preventing muslim brothers from standing in elections as independent candidates and sought to cripple the movement by arresting hundreds of brothers , among them some of the brotherhood ’ s most moderate leaders . the crackdown comes amid growing speculation that the 81-year-old egyptian president is grooming his investment banker son gamal as his successor to run in next year 's presidential election . masters of black humor , many egyptians say they can tell how close they are to elections by the number of muslim brothers being detained .
relations between the government in jordan and the islamic action front , the brotherhood 's jordanian chapter , are hardly less adversarial and further complicated by the front 's close ties to hamas , the islamist palestinian brotherhood off-shoot that rules gaza .
hamas , which won a landslide victory in palestinian elections in 2006 , is seen by israel and the united states as a terrorist movement and feared by conservative arab leaders , including jordan 's king abdullah .
egypt and jordan , despite their repressive measures , have largely sought to control the brotherhood rather than drive it into exile as did tunisia or syria , where the military in 1982 crushed the brothers in an assault that left up to 10,000 people dead .
the toll of repression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim brotherhood supreme leader mohammed mehdi akef has said he will not stand for re-election the strain of the repression is , however , starting to take its toll on the brotherhood .
splits within the egyptian movement after supreme guide mohammed mahdi akef announced that he would not stand for re-election in january of next year have spilled onto the pages of the egyptian media .
conservatives in the movement blocked akef 's nomination of a leading reformer to the movement 's leadership council .
in jordan , muslim brothers argue over whether the jordanian and palestinian branches of the movement should be intertwined or operate as separate organizations with separate memberships . yet , the strengthening of conservative forces within more moderate muslim brotherhood affiliates has , so far at least , not undermined commitment to democratic principles .
if anything , the divisions within the secretive movement constitute milestone developments and reflect an internal recommitment to those principles .
for the first time , the brotherhood 's infighting is taking place in full view of the public with internal party debates feeding the front pages of local newspapers .
to officials in cairo , amman , riyadh and washington , the brotherhood 's internal turmoil and its failure to initiate a backlash against the repression constitutes an indication of the hard-line approach 's success .
but that could be deceptive .
" this is dangerously shortsighted .
it weakens the foundations of democracy as a whole … and has a corrosive effect on public freedoms , transparency and accountability , " marc lynch , an expert on the brotherhood at washington 's george washington university , told deutsche welle .

observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .
these elections are the first ones where we have a local election not centered on the cause of independence , " deda said .
" it is about normal things , better public services , economic development , issues other countries campaign about . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation is " very favorable " according to nato last monday , new zealand became the 63rd country to recognize kosovo 's independence .
the united states and most of the european union also recognize kosovo although serbia 's traditional ally , russia , does not .
these elections are also important for kosovo 's international stature since belgrade is challenging the legality of kosovo 's independence at the international court of justice , where hearings are set to begin on december 1 .

observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .
these elections are the first ones where we have a local election not centered on the cause of independence , " deda said .
" it is about normal things , better public services , economic development , issues other countries campaign about . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation is " very favorable " according to nato last monday , new zealand became the 63rd country to recognize kosovo 's independence .
the united states and most of the european union also recognize kosovo although serbia 's traditional ally , russia , does not .
these elections are also important for kosovo 's international stature since belgrade is challenging the legality of kosovo 's independence at the international court of justice , where hearings are set to begin on december 1 .

observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .
these elections are the first ones where we have a local election not centered on the cause of independence , " deda said .
" it is about normal things , better public services , economic development , issues other countries campaign about . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation is " very favorable " according to nato last monday , new zealand became the 63rd country to recognize kosovo 's independence .
the united states and most of the european union also recognize kosovo although serbia 's traditional ally , russia , does not .
these elections are also important for kosovo 's international stature since belgrade is challenging the legality of kosovo 's independence at the international court of justice , where hearings are set to begin on december 1 .

observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .
these elections are the first ones where we have a local election not centered on the cause of independence , " deda said .
" it is about normal things , better public services , economic development , issues other countries campaign about . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation is " very favorable " according to nato last monday , new zealand became the 63rd country to recognize kosovo 's independence .
the united states and most of the european union also recognize kosovo although serbia 's traditional ally , russia , does not .
these elections are also important for kosovo 's international stature since belgrade is challenging the legality of kosovo 's independence at the international court of justice , where hearings are set to begin on december 1 .

observers say security was not a concern , but turnout could be . kosovo prime minister hashim thaci claimed victory for his party hours after polls closed sunday night , although complete preliminary results were n't expected until later in the day , the associated press reported .
thaci claimed his party won in 20 of the country 's 36 municipalities .
voters in kosovo have elected mayors and deputies for 36 town councils for the first time since the albanian-majority region unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february last year .
" it 's incredibly important for our country because it 's not an international organization which is doing this , but kosovo itself , " said driton tafallari , a member of an ngo coalition called democracy in action , which monitored the election and the run-up to it .
some 74 political parties , coalition citizens ' groups and independent candidates participated in the election , which according to observers has gone smoothly despite fears that serbia , which does not recognize kosovo 's independence , could try to derail the vote or keep ethnic serbs in the north away from the polls .
" there are some problems in that area , but overall the elections are going very well , " said tafallari earlier sunday .
voter turnout while voter participation was one of the main concerns for election organizers and observers , officials estimated turnout to be about 45 percent , a slight increase from 42 percent in the last elections in 2007 .
observers were paying particular attention to the serb minority , which belgrade and the serbian orthodox church had called on to boycott the elections .
the boycott appeared to be most effective in the north of the country , which borders serbia , but many serbs did participate in central kosovo , where two-thirds of ethnic serbs in kosovo live .
“ we live here and we see no other solution , ” said 47-year-old farmer and ethnic serb slobodan joksimovic , explaining why he chose to ignore the boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus bentler , kfor commander in kosovo there are about 1.5 million people eligible to vote , although some 300,000 are kosovo albanians living outside kosovo and another 100,000 are kosovo serbs in serbia or montenegro .
security concerns ?
other one-time worries , such as security concerns , also failed to materialize .
earlier this week , the top nato official in kosovo said the security situation was " very , very favorable " ahead of the vote . german general markus bentler , commander of the nato-led kosovo peacekeeping mission known as kfor , said his 13,000-strong force had no " indications that the election process will pose a security risk at the polling stations for the voters . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low turnout is the biggest worry among observers although there are still high levels of tension in the north of kosovo , bentler said kfor troops would be able to react at very short notice " if need be . "
however , ilir deda , the executive director of the kosovar institute for policy research and development , said general security concerns were not even on the table .
the main problem he has run across is accusations that serbia had been intimidating ethnic serbs in kosovo , threatening them with the loss of financial support such as pensions , salaries or social benefits that still flow from belgrade if they go to the polls .
path to normality " despite that , we are satisfied with the way things are going .
these elections are the first ones where we have a local election not centered on the cause of independence , " deda said .
" it is about normal things , better public services , economic development , issues other countries campaign about . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation is " very favorable " according to nato last monday , new zealand became the 63rd country to recognize kosovo 's independence .
the united states and most of the european union also recognize kosovo although serbia 's traditional ally , russia , does not .
these elections are also important for kosovo 's international stature since belgrade is challenging the legality of kosovo 's independence at the international court of justice , where hearings are set to begin on december 1 .

on sunday , us president barack obama and other world leaders attending the apec conference in singapore showed support for delaying such a binding pact until a later time .
the copenhagen summit will seek to draw up a successor to the kyoto protocol on climate change .
danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen , who flew to singapore to address leaders at the asia-pacific meeting , proposed a compromise that would call for continued negotiations and set a deadline for their conclusion .
" given the time factor and the situation of individual countries , we must in the coming weeks focus on what is possible and not let ourselves be distracted by what is not possible , " rasmussen said at the meeting .
rich-poor divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels add urgency to achieving an agreement on carbon emissions a major obstacle to reaching a binding agreement by next month is a disagreement between developed and developing countries .
chinese president hu jintao , while not explicitly backing a delay for a binding agreement , instead emphasized the need for wealthy nations to give financial support to developing nations who can not fight climate change on their own .
as news of support for a delay spread , environmental activists and other world leaders denounced the idea .
the environmental lobby group wwf released a statement saying the delay " does not look like a smart startegy to win the fight against climate change . "
french environment minister jean-louis borloo took aim specifically at the united states on sunday , saying washington is the main obstacle to reaching a binding agreement in copenhagen .
" -lrb- the united states is -rrb- the biggest per capita emitter and it 's saying ' i 'd like to but i ca n't . '
that 's the issue , " he said. acb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were on vacation , visiting los angeles and las vegas before making the drive to the desert .
two off-duty search and rescue workers were hiking in the area when they discovered bones and personal papers from one of the missing persons .
the site is several miles from where searchers found the family 's rented minivan months after their disappearance .
carma roper , a spokeswoman for the county sheriff , said authorities were " fairly certain " the remains were those of at least one of the group , although formally identifying them could take a while .
the cause of death has not yet been determined .
" at this point , it 's being handled like a criminal investigation ... but there is no evidence of foul play at this point , " roper said .
vacation turned tragic the family had arrived in the states at the beginning of july , and checked out of a las vegas hotel room on july 22 , arriving at death valley national park the same day .
they bought an informational booklet at the visitors ' center and apparently stayed there overnight .
the next day , they drove down a dirt road into a more remote area .
the heat that week reached 120 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- 49 degrees celsius -rrb- .
death valley is the hottest and driest location in north america .
the last trace of the visitors had been a note , scribbled in german , that the family signed in a guest book at an abandoned mining camp .
dated july 23 , it mentioned they would be going through " the pass " - possibly a reference to a nearby trail that crosses the mountains on the park 's southwestern border .
searchers found abandoned van - and a mystery on october 23 , 1996 , searchers found their rented plymouth voyager , stuck in some sand off anvil spring canyon , a roadless area far off the tourist track .
investigators believe that it had been driven for about two miles before stopping - despite having four flat tires .
inside were rolls of exposed film , sleeping bags , empty gallon water bottles , the booklet the family purchased at the visitors ’ center , and an american flag which apparently had been taken from a stone cabin five miles away .
there were no identification papers and no tracks around the vehicle .
about a quarter mile away , an empty beer bottle was found that matched others in the van. svs / ap / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the approval of slovenia , the fifth country to do so , brings russia closer to locking its control over the european gas supply .
south stream , which is estimated will cost 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- to build and is expected to be completed by 2015 , would run under the black sea to carry natural gas to western europe .
the european union has supported the construction of an alternative pipeline , known as nabucco , in an effort to counter russian monopolistic influence by importing gas from caspian sea nations like azerbijan and turkmenistan .
that project has been stalled , however , by a lack of supply agreements .
the politics of gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian claims the south stream line would ensure supplies by bypassing ukraine eu leaders have been pushing for more independence from russian natural gas since a dispute between moscow and kiev last january left many european homes without heat in the dead of winter .
about 80 percent of russian gas currently passes through ukraine , and russia has claimed the south stream line , which bypasses ukraine , would ensure a smoother supply .
another russian project , nord stream , would also bypass ukraine by piping gas to germany beneath the baltic sea .
denmark , sweden and finland have all given their approval to the project , meaning construction could start as soon as next year. acb / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before being shipped out to britain 's distant dominion , many of the children were told their parents were dead , and that a more abundant life awaited them in australia .
most were deported without the consent of their parents , and commonly , mothers and fathers were led to believe that their children had been adopted somewhere in britain .
on arrival in australia , the policy was to separate brothers and sisters .
and many of the young children ended up in what felt like labour camps , where they were physically , psychologically and often sexually abused .
' awful experience ' in testimony before a british parliamentary committee in the late 1990s , one boy spoke of the criminal abuse he was subjected at the hands of catholic priests at tardun in western australia .

on monday the australian prime minister kevin rudd will deliver a national apology to a group known as the " forgotten australians " .
in so doing , he will recognise , on behalf of the australian government , the ongoing suffering of some 500,000 people held in orphanages or children 's homes between 1930 and 1970 .
at the same time , mr rudd will also say sorry to some 7,000 child migrants from britain who live still in australia - castaways of the empire .
the australian government viewed them as ideal young immigrants - a popular slogan at the time was " the child , the best immigrant " .
the british government saw them as a burden on the state , and was happy to see them go . "

she thought she was being sent to africa , part of a wild adventure , but she ended up in melbourne .
" i spent years waiting for someone to realise they had made a mistake and to come and collect me , " she told me .
" i was at a loose end for a very long time . "
crying as she spoke , she says she was deprived of a childhood and a homeland .
" it took years and years of misery of not knowing where we 'd come from , who were , being denied our birthright of being british .
" it 's really been horrendous .
and i would n't wish it on anyone ...
we need to be welcomed back to our homeland . "
like most british migrants here , she is incensed that the australian government has decided to deliver a national apology , before the british government has done so .
" there has been no sorries , no righting the wrongs .
we 've suffered all our lives , and nobody 's listened .
i feel that someone has to listen and say sorry .the british government has so much to answer for .
how in the hell were we supposed to get back and find our families ?

shame attending the national apology in canberra will be margaret humphreys , a former nottinghamshire social worker who set up the child migrants trust in 1987 after being approached to help track down a former child migrant 's family .
in 1992 , in recognition of her work in the field - helping " a lost tribe , " as she puts it - she was honoured by the australians , which conferred on her an order of australia , a top civilian award .

gordon brown should hang his head in shame " harold haig international child migrants association " the australian government is delivering an apology when the british government has done nothing , " she complains .
ahead of the national apology , the australian government contacted about 400 british child migrants for advice on how it should be delivered .
all of them , she says , demanded that it should be accompanied by a british apology .
" what about gordon brown ? " she asks .
" this is disgusting .
they have abandoned us .
there is a huge feeling here that we are being abandoned by gordon brown . "
ahead of monday 's apology in australia , sources within the uk government have told the bbc that downing street will now consult with child migrants groups with a view to delivering some of kind of apology in the future .
up until now , the uk government has funded travel so that british child migrants can be reunited with their families - although the child migrants trust has complained that it only finances one visit , and that too many restrictions are placed on the reunion scheme .
it has also helped fund the child migrants trust for the past 15 years .
that is nowhere near good enough for harold haig , the secretary of the international child migrants association .
he is appalled that the australian apology has come before any british apology .
" look , it 's an absolute disgrace , " he told me .
" gordon brown should hang his head in shame .
he is allowing the country that we were deported to apologise before the country where we were born .
it is an absolute disgrace .
he should hang his head in shame . "
the child migrants trust is also unhappy that the australian government is combining the apology with australian-born children who were abused while they were in care .
they look upon themselves as a unique group with a distinct history .
ahead of australia 's national apology , the british department of health issued a statement saying that " -lsb- t -rsb- he child migrants scheme was wrong , " which has been the government 's stance since 1998 .
the british government has said it is considering the implications of the australian apology .

in so doing , he will recognise , on behalf of the australian government , the ongoing suffering of some 500,000 people held in orphanages or children 's homes between 1930 and 1970 .
at the same time , mr rudd will also say sorry to some 7,000 child migrants from britain who live still in australia - castaways of the empire .
the australian government viewed them as ideal young immigrants - a popular slogan at the time was " the child , the best immigrant " .
the british government saw them as a burden on the state , and was happy to see them go .
i spent years waiting for someone to realise they had made a mistake and to come and collect me sandra anker sandra anker was sent to australia in 1950 aged just six years old - or " exiled " , as she prefers to think of it .
she thought she was being sent to africa , part of a wild adventure , but she ended up in melbourne .
" i spent years waiting for someone to realise they had made a mistake and to come and collect me , " she told me .
" i was at a loose end for a very long time . "
crying as she spoke , she says she was deprived of a childhood and a homeland .
" it took years and years of misery of not knowing where we 'd come from , who were , being denied our birthright of being british .
" it 's really been horrendous .
and i would n't wish it on anyone ...
we need to be welcomed back to our homeland . "
child immigrants often did not know where they were going to end up like most british migrants here , she is incensed that the australian government has decided to deliver a national apology , before the british government has done so .
" there has been no sorries , no righting the wrongs .
we 've suffered all our lives , and nobody 's listened .
i feel that someone has to listen and say sorry .the british government has so much to answer for .
how in the hell were we supposed to get back and find our families ?

shame attending the national apology in canberra will be margaret humphreys , a former nottinghamshire social worker who set up the child migrants trust in 1987 after being approached to help track down a former child migrant 's family .
in 1992 , in recognition of her work in the field - helping " a lost tribe , " as she puts it - she was honoured by the australians , which conferred on her an order of australia , a top civilian award .
but not britain .
gordon brown should hang his head in shame harold haig international child migrants association " the australian government is delivering an apology when the british government has done nothing , " she complains .
ahead of the national apology , the australian government contacted about 400 british child migrants for advice on how it should be delivered .
all of them , she says , demanded that it should be accompanied by a british apology .
" what about gordon brown ? " she asks .
" this is disgusting .
they have abandoned us .
there is a huge feeling here that we are being abandoned by gordon brown . "
ahead of monday 's apology in australia , sources within the uk government have told the bbc that downing street will now consult with child migrants groups with a view to delivering some of kind of apology in the future .
up until now , the uk government has funded travel so that british child migrants can be reunited with their families - although the child migrants trust has complained that it only finances one visit , and that too many restrictions are placed on the reunion scheme .
it has also helped fund the child migrants trust for the past 15 years .
that is nowhere near good enough for harold haig , the secretary of the international child migrants association .
he is appalled that the australian apology has come before any british apology .
" look , it 's an absolute disgrace , " he told me .
" gordon brown should hang his head in shame .
he is allowing the country that we were deported to apologise before the country where we were born .
it is an absolute disgrace .
he should hang his head in shame . "
the child migrants trust is also unhappy that the australian government is combining the apology with australian-born children who were abused while they were in care .
they look upon themselves as a unique group with a distinct history .
ahead of australia 's national apology , the british department of health issued a statement saying that " -lsb- t -rsb- he child migrants scheme was wrong , " which has been the government 's stance since 1998 .
the british government has said it is considering the implications of the australian apology .

before being shipped out to britain 's distant dominion , many of the children were told their parents were dead , and that a more abundant life awaited them in australia .
most were deported without the consent of their parents , and commonly , mothers and fathers were led to believe that their children had been adopted somewhere in britain .
on arrival in australia , the policy was to separate brothers and sisters .
and many of the young children ended up in what felt like labour camps , where they were physically , psychologically and often sexually abused .
' awful experience ' in testimony before a british parliamentary committee in the late 1990s , one boy spoke of the criminal abuse he was subjected at the hands of catholic priests at tardun in western australia .
a number of christian brothers competed between themselves to see who could rape him 100 times first , the boy said .

sandra anker was sent out to australia when she was six years old they liked his blue eyes , so he repeatedly beat himself in the hope they would change colour .
as parliamentarians reflected at the time , the term " sexual abuse " seemed wholly inadequate given the awfulness of his experience .
on monday the australian prime minister kevin rudd will deliver a national apology to a group known as the " forgotten australians " .
in so doing , he will recognise , on behalf of the australian government , the ongoing suffering of some 500,000 people held in orphanages or children 's homes between 1930 and 1970 .
at the same time , mr rudd will also say sorry to some 7,000 child migrants from britain who live still in australia - castaways of the empire .
the australian government viewed them as ideal young immigrants - a popular slogan at the time was " the child , the best immigrant " .
the british government saw them as a burden on the state , and was happy to see them go .
i spent years waiting for someone to realise they had made a mistake and to come and collect me sandra anker sandra anker was sent to australia in 1950 aged just six years old - or " exiled " , as she prefers to think of it .
she thought she was being sent to africa , part of a wild adventure , but she ended up in melbourne .
" i spent years waiting for someone to realise they had made a mistake and to come and collect me , " she told me .
" i was at a loose end for a very long time . "
crying as she spoke , she says she was deprived of a childhood and a homeland .
" it took years and years of misery of not knowing where we 'd come from , who were , being denied our birthright of being british .
" it 's really been horrendous .
and i would n't wish it on anyone ...
we need to be welcomed back to our homeland . "
child immigrants often did not know where they were going to end up like most british migrants here , she is incensed that the australian government has decided to deliver a national apology , before the british government has done so .
" there has been no sorries , no righting the wrongs .
we 've suffered all our lives , and nobody 's listened .
i feel that someone has to listen and say sorry .the british government has so much to answer for .
how in the hell were we supposed to get back and find our families ?
where do you begin ?
where do you begin ? "
shame attending the national apology in canberra will be margaret humphreys , a former nottinghamshire social worker who set up the child migrants trust in 1987 after being approached to help track down a former child migrant 's family .
in 1992 , in recognition of her work in the field - helping " a lost tribe , " as she puts it - she was honoured by the australians , which conferred on her an order of australia , a top civilian award .
but not britain .
gordon brown should hang his head in shame harold haig international child migrants association " the australian government is delivering an apology when the british government has done nothing , " she complains .
ahead of the national apology , the australian government contacted about 400 british child migrants for advice on how it should be delivered .
all of them , she says , demanded that it should be accompanied by a british apology .
" what about gordon brown ? " she asks .
" this is disgusting .
they have abandoned us .
there is a huge feeling here that we are being abandoned by gordon brown . "
ahead of monday 's apology in australia , sources within the uk government have told the bbc that downing street will now consult with child migrants groups with a view to delivering some of kind of apology in the future .
up until now , the uk government has funded travel so that british child migrants can be reunited with their families - although the child migrants trust has complained that it only finances one visit , and that too many restrictions are placed on the reunion scheme .
it has also helped fund the child migrants trust for the past 15 years .
that is nowhere near good enough for harold haig , the secretary of the international child migrants association .
he is appalled that the australian apology has come before any british apology .
" look , it 's an absolute disgrace , " he told me .
" gordon brown should hang his head in shame .
he is allowing the country that we were deported to apologise before the country where we were born .
it is an absolute disgrace .
he should hang his head in shame . "
the child migrants trust is also unhappy that the australian government is combining the apology with australian-born children who were abused while they were in care .
they look upon themselves as a unique group with a distinct history .
ahead of australia 's national apology , the british department of health issued a statement saying that " -lsb- t -rsb- he child migrants scheme was wrong , " which has been the government 's stance since 1998 .
the british government has said it is considering the implications of the australian apology .

gordon brown should hang his head in shame harold haig international child migrants association " the australian government is delivering an apology when the british government has done nothing , " she complains .
ahead of the national apology , the australian government contacted about 400 british child migrants for advice on how it should be delivered .
all of them , she says , demanded that it should be accompanied by a british apology .
" what about gordon brown ? " she asks .
" this is disgusting .
they have abandoned us .
there is a huge feeling here that we are being abandoned by gordon brown . "
ahead of monday 's apology in australia , sources within the uk government have told the bbc that downing street will now consult with child migrants groups with a view to delivering some of kind of apology in the future .
up until now , the uk government has funded travel so that british child migrants can be reunited with their families - although the child migrants trust has complained that it only finances one visit , and that too many restrictions are placed on the reunion scheme .
it has also helped fund the child migrants trust for the past 15 years .
that is nowhere near good enough for harold haig , the secretary of the international child migrants association .
he is appalled that the australian apology has come before any british apology .
" look , it 's an absolute disgrace , " he told me .
" gordon brown should hang his head in shame .
he is allowing the country that we were deported to apologise before the country where we were born .
it is an absolute disgrace .
he should hang his head in shame . "
the child migrants trust is also unhappy that the australian government is combining the apology with australian-born children who were abused while they were in care .
they look upon themselves as a unique group with a distinct history .
ahead of australia 's national apology , the british department of health issued a statement saying that " -lsb- t -rsb- he child migrants scheme was wrong , " which has been the government 's stance since 1998 .
the british government has said it is considering the implications of the australian apology .

believing she had been accepted for a loan , she says she happily handed over her bank details in order to complete the application .
but she says she was transferred to another member of staff who then told her she had been declined for the loan .
instead , the sister company of yes loans , called money worries said it could offer her a debt management plan to help her through her financial difficulties . "
i never signed anything , and i never gave them consent .
it 's caused us lots of hardship " louise cowan , customer the sales agent told her that money worries would negotiate with her various creditors to get her debt into a single affordable monthly payment .
for this , the company would take an upfront fee , and a percentage of each instalment .
louise says she made it clear she did not want to go ahead without first consulting her husband .
no consent so she was shocked when she opened her next bank statement and saw that money had been paid to money worries .
" i never signed anything , and i never gave them consent .

whistleblower megan remembers boxes of cheques of creditors ' payments just piling up in the office after being returned because they contained administrative mistakes .
" it was n't dealt with until it was realised that there were boxes and boxes of them -lsb- cheques -rsb- potentially worth thousands and thousands and thousands of pounds which should have been paid to creditors . "
money worries says that payments to creditors can sometimes take many weeks to finalise while the company waits for them to agree to the negotiated instalments .
but its statement stresses : " all client money we receive is kept in a separate client account in accordance with office of fair trading requirements .
" it is not usable by us and does not benefit us financially .
" if for any reason a delay occurs in paying creditors on behalf of our customers , we take whatever steps are necessary to put the customer in a position where they do not suffer any detriment as a result . "
the statement also points out that money worries recognises that not all the potential customers it speaks to needs its debt management service and suggests alternatives for those people .
" we refer approximately three times as many people to other organisations for alternative debt solutions than we take on as clients of money worries , " it adds .
unregulated industry beyond the specific case of money worries , there are wider concerns about the uk 's debt management industry .
the sector is currently unregulated , although the government has recently announced a consultation as to whether this should change .
the conclusions of the consultation are expected to be published before the end of the year .
there is an industry body called the debt managers standards association -lrb- demsa -rrb- .
membership of demsa commits the firm to a rigorous code of conduct which is approved by the office of fair trading .
but only a small number of companies are currently signed up .
in the last 10 years it has been estimated that the number of debt management companies has increased significantly .
the money advice trust estimates that there are now over 150 firms offering debt management services to over 300,000 people for a fee .
its research further found that the quality of service varied .
poor practice identified included creditors being paid late or not at all .
there was also some evidence that customers were not clear on the level of fees they were being charged and they were sometimes put in a worse financial position .
as for money worries customer rod , he is now getting his finances back in order thanks to a free debt management service .

louise cowan from belfast needed some extra cash .
when she saw an advert for loans with welsh loan broker , yes loans , she immediately got on the phone .
believing she had been accepted for a loan , she says she happily handed over her bank details in order to complete the application .
but she says she was transferred to another member of staff who then told her she had been declined for the loan .
instead , the sister company of yes loans , called money worries said it could offer her a debt management plan to help her through her financial difficulties .
i never signed anything , and i never gave them consent .
it 's caused us lots of hardship louise cowan , customer the sales agent told her that money worries would negotiate with her various creditors to get her debt into a single affordable monthly payment .
for this , the company would take an upfront fee , and a percentage of each instalment .
louise says she made it clear she did not want to go ahead without first consulting her husband .
no consent so she was shocked when she opened her next bank statement and saw that money had been paid to money worries .
" i never signed anything , and i never gave them consent .

according to her , consideration for the customers ' best interests may not have been the priority in taking this fee .
" staff were allowed to ask people if they had any credit cards , so they could max those out , which is ridiculous , because it would put people more in debt . "

" i do n't believe they 're providing any service to people that 's beneficial at all .
it 's money for nothing . "
louise cowan from belfast needed some extra cash .
when she saw an advert for loans with welsh loan broker , yes loans , she immediately got on the phone .
believing she had been accepted for a loan , she says she happily handed over her bank details in order to complete the application .
but she says she was transferred to another member of staff who then told her she had been declined for the loan .
instead , the sister company of yes loans , called money worries said it could offer her a debt management plan to help her through her financial difficulties .
i never signed anything , and i never gave them consent .
it 's caused us lots of hardship louise cowan , customer the sales agent told her that money worries would negotiate with her various creditors to get her debt into a single affordable monthly payment .
for this , the company would take an upfront fee , and a percentage of each instalment .
louise says she made it clear she did not want to go ahead without first consulting her husband .
no consent so she was shocked when she opened her next bank statement and saw that money had been paid to money worries .
" i never signed anything , and i never gave them consent .
it 's caused us lots of hardship . "
the unexpected expense put louise 's account into unauthorised overdraft and she incurred further bank charges .
money worries statement read the written response from money worries here money worries says that louise did consent verbally and says it did undertake work on her behalf .
and in a statement , it adds : " we categorically deny that we take fees from customers ' accounts without them realising . "
it says details of payments are " clearly explained in plan intelligible language in the documentation we provide to customers " .

one whistleblower told the bbc that a large number of money worries ' customers were passed through from yes loans .
and she says that the scripts were carefully worded and some people have consented to payments without necessarily realising it .
whistleblower megan - not her real name - wants to remain anonymous , for fear of reprisals .
according to her , consideration for the customers ' best interests may not have been the priority in taking this fee .
" staff were allowed to ask people if they had any credit cards , so they could max those out , which is ridiculous , because it would put people more in debt . "
desperate situation rod is another unhappy customer of money worries .
he says that while he did consent to pay for its services , he continued to receive letters from the institutions he owed money to advising him that his debts remained unpaid .
he says he paid more than £ 500 to the company and that his dealings with the firm left him worse off than before .
" i really believe that this company are simply using the absolute desperation of people who really have little or no option to make money .
i seriously contemplated suicide on a number of occasions . "

however , former employees of money worries told 5 live 's donal macintyre programme that creditors are sometimes not paid or not paid promptly .
whistleblower megan remembers boxes of cheques of creditors ' payments just piling up in the office after being returned because they contained administrative mistakes .
" it was n't dealt with until it was realised that there were boxes and boxes of them -lsb- cheques -rsb- potentially worth thousands and thousands and thousands of pounds which should have been paid to creditors . "
money worries says that payments to creditors can sometimes take many weeks to finalise while the company waits for them to agree to the negotiated instalments .
but its statement stresses : " all client money we receive is kept in a separate client account in accordance with office of fair trading requirements .
" it is not usable by us and does not benefit us financially .
" if for any reason a delay occurs in paying creditors on behalf of our customers , we take whatever steps are necessary to put the customer in a position where they do not suffer any detriment as a result . "
the statement also points out that money worries recognises that not all the potential customers it speaks to needs its debt management service and suggests alternatives for those people .
" we refer approximately three times as many people to other organisations for alternative debt solutions than we take on as clients of money worries , " it adds .
unregulated industry beyond the specific case of money worries , there are wider concerns about the uk 's debt management industry .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
the sector is currently unregulated , although the government has recently announced a consultation as to whether this should change .
the conclusions of the consultation are expected to be published before the end of the year .
there is an industry body called the debt managers standards association -lrb- demsa -rrb- .
membership of demsa commits the firm to a rigorous code of conduct which is approved by the office of fair trading .
an estimated 150 firms charge 300 000 people for debt management services but only a small number of companies are currently signed up .
in the last 10 years it has been estimated that the number of debt management companies has increased significantly .
the money advice trust estimates that there are now over 150 firms offering debt management services to over 300,000 people for a fee .
its research further found that the quality of service varied .
poor practice identified included creditors being paid late or not at all .
there was also some evidence that customers were not clear on the level of fees they were being charged and they were sometimes put in a worse financial position .
as for money worries customer rod , he is now getting his finances back in order thanks to a free debt management service .

reporters without borders said it was " surprised " that the internet governance forum will take place in egypt 's sharm-el-sheikh resort .
set up by the un , about 1,400 participants are expected to attend the three-day meeting which gets under way on 15 november .
delegates will debate security , access and the growth of social networks .
in a statement reporters without borders said : " it is astonishing that a government that is openly hostile to internet users is assigned the organisation of an international meeting on the internet 's future . "
the internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- brings together government officials , business folk and net luminaries .
web creator sir tim berners-lee is due to deliver one of the keynote speeches at the event .
the igf grew out of a previous meeting called world summit on the information society that was held in tunisia in 2005 .
originally the igf was given a five-year mandate and at this year 's meeting it will " take stock of the accomplishments ... and discuss whether it should be maintained for the future " .
the igf is not a decision-making body , which has led critics to question its role in the running of the net .
markus kummer , executive co-ordinator of the igf , said the forum played an important role .
equal weight " it recognises the issues that are significant and puts them on the agenda of those with the ability to do something about it , " he said .
" initially the net community was not keen to have yet another meeting but they have been converted .
while it is hard to offer empirical evidence of our success , there is plenty of anecdotal evidence , " he said .
he recalls a pacific islander who travels every year to the conference .
" it is his one-stop meeting to get updated on net developments .
as a result of the igf he has set up an internet exchange point on his island , " he said .
the meetings have spawned smaller , regional ones in africa , the caribbean and other parts of the world .
the nature of the igf where government ministers , business leaders , non-governmental organisations are given equal weight has also been important , he thinks .
" one senior official in kenya said that the government had never talked to stakeholders and now they do , while the head of a large telecommunications firm said he had never spoken to ngos before but doing so proved beneficial in the development of their products , " said mr kummer .
likely to figure high on the agenda will be the debate about how to balance access to information with protecting copyright .
it is a hot topic at the moment as the uk government introduces tough penalties for those who persistently download illegal content , including removing persistent pirates from the net .
france and the us are also pursuing similar policies , while the european union is also considering how to deal with pirates and whether to make the internet a fundamental right for users .
the growth of social media will also figure large at this year 's conference as the forum asks whether the content available via social networks is ushering in a better-informed society .

reporters without borders said it was " surprised " that the internet governance forum will take place in egypt 's sharm-el-sheikh resort .
set up by the un , about 1,400 participants are expected to attend the three-day meeting which gets under way on 15 november .
delegates will debate security , access and the growth of social networks .
in a statement reporters without borders said : " it is astonishing that a government that is openly hostile to internet users is assigned the organisation of an international meeting on the internet 's future . "
the internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- brings together government officials , business folk and net luminaries .
web creator sir tim berners-lee is due to deliver one of the keynote speeches at the event .
the igf grew out of a previous meeting called world summit on the information society that was held in tunisia in 2005 .
originally the igf was given a five-year mandate and at this year 's meeting it will " take stock of the accomplishments ... and discuss whether it should be maintained for the future " .
the igf is not a decision-making body , which has led critics to question its role in the running of the net .
markus kummer , executive co-ordinator of the igf , said the forum played an important role .
equal weight " it recognises the issues that are significant and puts them on the agenda of those with the ability to do something about it , " he said .
" initially the net community was not keen to have yet another meeting but they have been converted .
while it is hard to offer empirical evidence of our success , there is plenty of anecdotal evidence , " he said .
he recalls a pacific islander who travels every year to the conference .
" it is his one-stop meeting to get updated on net developments .
as a result of the igf he has set up an internet exchange point on his island , " he said .
the meetings have spawned smaller , regional ones in africa , the caribbean and other parts of the world .
the nature of the igf where government ministers , business leaders , non-governmental organisations are given equal weight has also been important , he thinks .
" one senior official in kenya said that the government had never talked to stakeholders and now they do , while the head of a large telecommunications firm said he had never spoken to ngos before but doing so proved beneficial in the development of their products , " said mr kummer .
likely to figure high on the agenda will be the debate about how to balance access to information with protecting copyright .
it is a hot topic at the moment as the uk government introduces tough penalties for those who persistently download illegal content , including removing persistent pirates from the net .
france and the us are also pursuing similar policies , while the european union is also considering how to deal with pirates and whether to make the internet a fundamental right for users .
the growth of social media will also figure large at this year 's conference as the forum asks whether the content available via social networks is ushering in a better-informed society .

the policy - which ended in abuse and exploitation for many of the youngsters - was certainly abominable , it argues , but mr brown had no part in it .
saying sorry makes sense only when you are to blame , according to the telegraph - otherwise , an official apology simply marks the first stage in the process of extracting compensation .

the policy - which ended in abuse and exploitation for many of the youngsters - was certainly abominable , it argues , but mr brown had no part in it .
saying sorry makes sense only when you are to blame , according to the telegraph - otherwise , an official apology simply marks the first stage in the process of extracting compensation .
the sunday mirror and mail on sunday both carry an interview with the mother of the seriously ill boy , baby rb whose life support machine was turned off on friday after a highly-charged court case about his treatment .
meanwhile the queen 's speech takes place this week , but many of the papers ca n't wait that long to reveal what will be in it .
not as much as usual , according to the news of the world , which says the speech will last just 20 minutes - about half as long as last year 's .
' mak yir views kent ' the sunday times claims to know the true identity of the blogger known as belle de jour , whose account of her secret life as a prostitute has become a best-seller .
she contacted the paper , it reports , saying she wanted to unmask herself .
and the mail on sunday says sections of the scottish parliament 's website have been translated into the scots dialect .
one page reads : " ye hae money weys tae mak yir views kent whan ye have strang feelings aboot issues . "

debbie court of touch trust on its greater prominence since moving into the wales millennium centre " devolution is not just about the national assembly and its 60 members , " said presiding officer dafydd elis-thomas .
" it 's about increasing participation in the political process and getting as many people in wales to have a say in the future of the country . "
he added that the weekend 's events were a opportunity to visit the senedd building in cardiff bay , and watch some " unique welsh performances " .
poets gillian clarke and ceri wyn jones have written works based on the theme of 10 years of devolution .
they were performed , along with other poems , in the senedd building on saturday .
it has been a pleasure , rather than a duty , to compose a poem that will celebrate the 10th birthday of an institution that has begun to give wales and its people long-overdue political recognition ceri wyn jones ms clarke said she felt " bitter disappointment " when wales initially rejected devolution in a referendum in 1979 .
' poetic duty ' " in 1997 , when the dramatic result in carmarthen - my father 's county - was declared , despair turned to rejoicing at the very last moment , " she said .
" we are grown-ups now , with responsibility for at least some of the decisions that affect our lives in wales . "
ceri wyn jones added : " marking occasions has been part and parcel of the poet 's duties in wales for centuries .
" in my case , however , it has been a pleasure , rather than a duty , to compose a poem that will celebrate the 10th birthday of an institution that has begun to give wales and its people long-overdue political recognition . "
the wales millennium centre is marking its fifth birthday with two days of performances , many free , and the chance for members of the public to take a " behind the scenes " glimpse of some of its work , including welsh national opera rehearsals and theatre performance for children .
fiona allan , wales millennium centre 's artistic director , said : " we 're opening our doors this weekend so that people can call in , explore and take part in a range of activities to help us celebrate our fifth birthday .
" it really is an ' access-all-areas ' weekend where visitors can take a backstage tour , see performances or join in a drama , dance or music workshop . "
saturday evening also saw a concert celebrating the 65th birthday of one of wales ' most distinguished composers , karl jenkins .
the bill featured some of his best known works , including songs of sanctuary , requiem and the million-selling adiemus .

debbie court of touch trust on its greater prominence since moving into the wales millennium centre " devolution is not just about the national assembly and its 60 members , " said presiding officer dafydd elis-thomas .

debbie court of touch trust on its greater prominence since moving into the wales millennium centre " devolution is not just about the national assembly and its 60 members , " said presiding officer dafydd elis-thomas .
" it 's about increasing participation in the political process and getting as many people in wales to have a say in the future of the country . "
he added that the weekend 's events were a opportunity to visit the senedd building in cardiff bay , and watch some " unique welsh performances " .
poets gillian clarke and ceri wyn jones have written works based on the theme of 10 years of devolution .
they were performed , along with other poems , in the senedd building on saturday .
it has been a pleasure , rather than a duty , to compose a poem that will celebrate the 10th birthday of an institution that has begun to give wales and its people long-overdue political recognition ceri wyn jones ms clarke said she felt " bitter disappointment " when wales initially rejected devolution in a referendum in 1979 .
' poetic duty ' " in 1997 , when the dramatic result in carmarthen - my father 's county - was declared , despair turned to rejoicing at the very last moment , " she said .
" we are grown-ups now , with responsibility for at least some of the decisions that affect our lives in wales . "
ceri wyn jones added : " marking occasions has been part and parcel of the poet 's duties in wales for centuries .
" in my case , however , it has been a pleasure , rather than a duty , to compose a poem that will celebrate the 10th birthday of an institution that has begun to give wales and its people long-overdue political recognition . "
the wales millennium centre is marking its fifth birthday with two days of performances , many free , and the chance for members of the public to take a " behind the scenes " glimpse of some of its work , including welsh national opera rehearsals and theatre performance for children .
fiona allan , wales millennium centre 's artistic director , said : " we 're opening our doors this weekend so that people can call in , explore and take part in a range of activities to help us celebrate our fifth birthday .
" it really is an ' access-all-areas ' weekend where visitors can take a backstage tour , see performances or join in a drama , dance or music workshop . "
saturday evening also saw a concert celebrating the 65th birthday of one of wales ' most distinguished composers , karl jenkins .
the bill featured some of his best known works , including songs of sanctuary , requiem and the million-selling adiemus .

just months ago many had been driven out of their jobs by taliban militants .
but things changed after swat became the centre of a major three-month military offensive to drive the insurgents from their regional stronghold .
and as pakistan 's army continues its offensive against militants elsewhere in south waziristan , a certain kind of normality is returning to the swat valley .
on the surface everything looks as it should .
but an ak-47 draped over the shoulder of a traffic warden shows that things are not yet completely safe .
the police have been the main target of the taliban in this area for years .
the latest attack on police recruits in neighbouring shangla district in october killed about 45 people .
restoring calm but the area has moved on some way from a few months ago when people were forced to flee the intense fighting between the taliban and government forces .
the authorities say they are now in control of the region and they are trying to rebuild a seriously depleted police force . "
our morale is definitely improving .
we 're getting what we need in terms of finances and weapons " qazi ghulam farooq swat valley district police officer to avoid being attacked , some officers had even placed advertisements in local newspapers publicising the fact that they no longer were associated with the police .
many who stayed refused to wear trousers for fear of being targeted by the taliban for being in western dress .
but the offensive against the militants has now created opportunities for the police to return - and with some confidence .
" our morale is definitely improving .
we 're getting what we need in terms of finances and weapons , " swat 's district police officer qazi ghulam farooq says .
but he warns more has to be done .
" we have made some additional demands such as the provision of armoured personal carriers for each police station .
this will further make us stand on our own two feet . "
taking control in his office is a framed certificate of appreciation from the government , a clear signal that boosting morale in this region is the main focus of the authorities .
out on the streets there also visible signs that the government has invested in improving security .
police stations are now fortified by strong walls , barbed wire and blockades .
nine old and five newly established police stations are now functional and the authorities have set up four new police sub-divisional offices to restore peace in the valley .
outside the district police officers office , a dozen youngsters were queuing up to join the police - an encouraging sign .
initially there were not enough applicants , so the department had to re-advertise for recruits .
but qazi farooq says the shortfall was because the police changed the criteria that new recruits had to meet .
some of these new recruits , mostly in their early 20s , seem undeterred by the fact that they are choosing a dangerous career .
take for example abdus sattar , who asks the question - if young people like him do n't join up to bring peace then who will ?
unemployment is high in the region and he admits that " ' yes , unemployment was a factor , but with this job i am able to manage my finances .
" the real issue though is peace and for that someone has to come forward , " he adds .
the youths are not the only ones who are volunteering ; retired soldiers are also being re-employed .
" we received five platoons of retired army officers a few days back , " exclaims a delighted qazi farooq .
taliban revenge the taliban though have not completely gone away .
october 's blast targeting a security convoy occurred in shangla - an area previously thought to be clear of militants .
the taliban have vowed to avenge the killing of pakistan 's taliban leader baitullah mehsud and to retaliate against the current offensive in south waziristan .
the taliban leader in swat , maulana fazlullah , had earlier issued a message to the media warning people not to join government departments that do not adhere to sharia or islamic law .
he also said " those already in government service should also reconsider their options " .
on the streets of mingora , residents who endured years of taliban rule say they are happy to see the police back on duty .
" it is a reassuring sight , " says one local shopper zahid khan .
" but i do n't know whether they have the ability to stop the taliban from resurfacing or not .
i hope they do have it . "
the government seems determined not to let the region fall back into the hands of the taliban .
several important installations which were once controlled by the militants are now being manned by the military , who can also be seen patrolling the streets .
however many people here think it will take a long time and a lot of investment before the police can really operate independently with strength and effectiveness .

just months ago many had been driven out of their jobs by taliban militants .
but things changed after swat became the centre of a major three-month military offensive to drive the insurgents from their regional stronghold .
and as pakistan 's army continues its offensive against militants elsewhere in south waziristan , a certain kind of normality is returning to the swat valley .
on the surface everything looks as it should .
but an ak-47 draped over the shoulder of a traffic warden shows that things are not yet completely safe .
the police have been the main target of the taliban in this area for years .
the latest attack on police recruits in neighbouring shangla district in october killed about 45 people .
restoring calm but the area has moved on some way from a few months ago when people were forced to flee the intense fighting between the taliban and government forces .
the authorities say they are now in control of the region and they are trying to rebuild a seriously depleted police force .
our morale is definitely improving .
we 're getting what we need in terms of finances and weapons qazi ghulam farooq swat valley district police officer to avoid being attacked , some officers had even placed advertisements in local newspapers publicising the fact that they no longer were associated with the police .
many who stayed refused to wear trousers for fear of being targeted by the taliban for being in western dress .
but the offensive against the militants has now created opportunities for the police to return - and with some confidence .
" our morale is definitely improving .
we 're getting what we need in terms of finances and weapons , " swat 's district police officer qazi ghulam farooq says .
but he warns more has to be done .
" we have made some additional demands such as the provision of armoured personal carriers for each police station .
this will further make us stand on our own two feet . "
taking control in his office is a framed certificate of appreciation from the government , a clear signal that boosting morale in this region is the main focus of the authorities .
out on the streets there also visible signs that the government has invested in improving security .
police stations are now fortified by strong walls , barbed wire and blockades .
nine old and five newly established police stations are now functional and the authorities have set up four new police sub-divisional offices to restore peace in the valley .
mingora was the scene of intense fighting but is now calm outside the district police officers office , a dozen youngsters were queuing up to join the police - an encouraging sign .
initially there were not enough applicants , so the department had to re-advertise for recruits .
but qazi farooq says the shortfall was because the police changed the criteria that new recruits had to meet .
some of these new recruits , mostly in their early 20s , seem undeterred by the fact that they are choosing a dangerous career .
take for example abdus sattar , who asks the question - if young people like him do n't join up to bring peace then who will ?
unemployment is high in the region and he admits that " ' yes , unemployment was a factor , but with this job i am able to manage my finances .
" the real issue though is peace and for that someone has to come forward , " he adds .
the youths are not the only ones who are volunteering ; retired soldiers are also being re-employed .
