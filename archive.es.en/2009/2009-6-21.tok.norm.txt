program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 21.06.2009 trade in whale meat picking up , despite being outlawed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whaling is technically outlawed , but still common practice ahead of a meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- , environmentalists warn that global trade in whale meat is on the rise .
europe is soon to take the lead in the hunt , over japan . starting monday , the iwc will gather on the portuguese island of madeira for five days , looking to establish concrete rules on whale hunting .
environmentalists say trade in whale meat is increasing again , despite being illegal in most of the world .
commercial whale hunting is officially permitted in iceland and norway .
japan also allows whaling for scientific purposes - the country catches roughly 1,000 of the giants of the deep each year .
however , japanese whale meat not needed in the laboratory often ends up on restaurant menus instead .
japan has said it wants to reduce the scale of its scientific whaling , in exchange for rights to commercial whale hunting near its coastline .
" that would amount to lifting the commercial whaling ban that has been in force since 1986 , " says sandra altherr of the organization pro wildlife .
the three whaling nations have been pushing for an end to the international ban on trade in whale meat .
the industry is currently outlawed under the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : greenpeace members often put their lives on the line to stop whaling vessels norway and iceland reserved their right to resume hunting in this 1986 moratorium .
since then both countries have taken up the trade again , while japan circumvented the regulation by reintroducing what it calls its " scientific whaling program . "
denmark is also hoping for a special whaling dispensation , trying to convince the eu to permit greenland to hunt 50 humpback whales over five years for domestic consumption .
critics say that denmark really wants to reintroduce commercial whaling off its own shores , even though there is already plenty of whale meat available there .
flourishing trade the three nations that have rejected the moratorium are free to trade small quantities of meat amongst themselves .
after a gap of a few decades , japan started importing whale meat in 2008 .
currently japan brings in a few tons from iceland , and under 10 tons from norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whalers in scandinavia and japan say they 're just like any other fishermen the nordic nations want to increase these amounts .
the norwegian firm lofothval has obtained export licenses for 47 tons of whale meat .
greenpeace has said this is a sign of desperation .
" that shows the despair of the whaling industry that ca n't sell its products in norway and so is trying to get rid of them abroad at any price , " says truls gulowsen , the head of greenpeace in scandinavia .
" the japanese eat less and less whale meat and their warehouses are already full of products that the local hunters ca n't get rid of . "

the speech came just ahead of the next german islam conference in berlin . in his cairo speech , schaeuble pointed out that there was legal equality for muslims in germany .
the country 's three million muslims have " the same rights , because our state guarantees freedom of religion and is not limited to a singular world view . "
the interior minister explained it was crucial that muslims living in germany learnt the language and added that the successful integration of islam into western societies will only work if muslims accept democratic constitutions " without condition . "
" whether we like it or not , there are many people who think that islam and democracy do n't mix .
these are often people who have prejudices against islam , " schaeuble told the audience of egyptian politicians and intellectuals .
" but we must also not ignore the fact that there are some muslims who also hold this opinion , " schaeuble continued .
he warned that this minority was seeing to it “ that their opinion is heard worldwide . "

the speech came just ahead of the next german islam conference in berlin . in his cairo speech , schaeuble pointed out that there was legal equality for muslims in germany .
the country 's three million muslims have " the same rights , because our state guarantees freedom of religion and is not limited to a singular world view . "
the interior minister explained it was crucial that muslims living in germany learnt the language and added that the successful integration of islam into western societies will only work if muslims accept democratic constitutions " without condition . "
" whether we like it or not , there are many people who think that islam and democracy do n't mix .
these are often people who have prejudices against islam , " schaeuble told the audience of egyptian politicians and intellectuals .
" but we must also not ignore the fact that there are some muslims who also hold this opinion , " schaeuble continued .
he warned that this minority was seeing to it “ that their opinion is heard worldwide . "
to combat anti-democratic tendencies , schaeuble also said that muslim children living in germany should receive islamic courses in german .
he supported the plan that islamic clerics in the country should also be trained at german universities .
currently most of the clerics at muslim mosques in germany have received their religious training outside of germany .
this , schaeuble stressed , could only be a temporary solution .
ahead of his speech , the german interior minister met with several representatives of the egyptian government , as well as muslim and christian clerics .
the trip to egypt comes four days ahead of the next german islam conference - which schaeuble helped initiate .
the conference will begin on thursday in berlin. ai / dpa / kna editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

championship leader jenson button struggled home in sixth place . vettel 's third career win was largely similar to his first two : he started from pole position , led for the majority of the race and was never seriously challenged .
he pulled clear from the start and delivered a perfectly judged drive to dominate the race at silverstone .
the 21-year-old came in ahead of red bull teammate mark webber and rubens barrichello of brawn gp . the victory was vettel 's second this season , and his first on a dry circuit .
" thank you very much guys , this is a dream coming true .
we 've von the british grand prix , " he said over the team radio after taking the checkered flag .
after all the political chicanery over the past three days , the race was a more predictable affair with a huge crowd and a paddock packed with celebrities , who were treated to a demonstration drive by vettel .
button maintains lead brawn 's jenson button , who leads the championship , started sixth , but fell to ninth after the opening lap .
he worked himself back into the points and then made up two places at his second pitstop , when he switched back to softer tires .
his brawn struggled with its obligatory stint on the harder rubber compound , with the briton unable to get enough heat into the tires .
in the end , button managed a disappointing sixth place and sees his overall advantage trimmed to 23 points over rubens barichello .

championship leader jenson button struggled home in sixth place . vettel 's third career win was largely similar to his first two : he started from pole position , led for the majority of the race and was never seriously challenged .
he pulled clear from the start and delivered a perfectly judged drive to dominate the race at silverstone .
the 21-year-old came in ahead of red bull teammate mark webber and rubens barrichello of brawn gp . the victory was vettel 's second this season , and his first on a dry circuit .
" thank you very much guys , this is a dream coming true .
we 've von the british grand prix , " he said over the team radio after taking the checkered flag .
after all the political chicanery over the past three days , the race was a more predictable affair with a huge crowd and a paddock packed with celebrities , who were treated to a demonstration drive by vettel .
button maintains lead brawn 's jenson button , who leads the championship , started sixth , but fell to ninth after the opening lap .
he worked himself back into the points and then made up two places at his second pitstop , when he switched back to softer tires .
his brawn struggled with its obligatory stint on the harder rubber compound , with the briton unable to get enough heat into the tires .
in the end , button managed a disappointing sixth place and sees his overall advantage trimmed to 23 points over rubens barichello .
but despite the setback , button maintains his comfortable lead in the driver 's standings with 64 points from eight races , followed by barichello on 41 and with vettel a distant third , on 39 points .
felipe massa of ferrari came in fourth , ahead of german nico rosberg for williams .

" if this huge volume of cheating and changing the votes ... which has hurt people 's trust , is presented as the very evidence of the lack of cheating , then it will butcher the republican aspect of the system , and the idea that islam is incompatible with a republic will be proven , " mousavi said .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who last week ordered a probe into allegations of electoral fraud , had insisted in his friday sermon that the margin of ahmadinejad 's victory over mousavi meant there had been no cheating .
iran 's electoral watchdog , the 12-member guardians council , said on saturday it was ready to randomly recount up to 10 percent of the ballot boxes from the election , state television reported .
opposition leader calls for purging of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mousavi issues the strongest challenge to the ayatollah since the islamic revolution mousavi added that the islamic republic must be purged of what he called lies and dishonesty , sending out a direct challenge to conservative rulers after a week of unrest in iran .
the opposition leader , who claims victory in the poll , told supporters he was " ready for martyrdom " , according to an ally .
but he said he did not seek confrontation with the authorities .
" we are not against the islamic system and its laws but against lies and deviations and just want to reform it , " he said in a statement on his website at the end of another tumultuous day .
mousavi said if authorities refused to allow peaceful protests they would face the " consequences " – an apparent rejoinder to khamenei 's warning that opposition leaders would be held responsible for any bloodshed resulting from protests .
" the people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ...
the islamic revolution should be the way it was and the way it should be , " mousavi said .
" if the people 's trust is not matched by protecting their votes , or if they are not able to defend their rights in a civil peaceful reaction , there will be dangerous ways ahead . "
riot police out in force as protests turn violent bildunterschrift : protestors defied khamenei 's demands and faced off against security forces in tehran mousavi 's statements came after police firing tear gas and water canons clashed with thousands of protestors who defied an ultimatum from ayatollah ali khamenei for an end to their street protests .
at least one person was wounded when shots rang out during saturday 's rally as demonstrators faced off against hundreds of security personnel to assemble in enghelab -lrb- revolution -rrb- square in the heart of the capital , witnesses said .
helicopters criss-crossed tehran and ambulance sirens wailed into the night after streets emptied of protesters who had defied friday 's stern warning from khamenei during his weekly prayers .
the head of iran 's security council , abbas mohtaj , on saturday delivered a specific warning to mousavi and his supporters .
" your national duty tells you to refrain from provoking illegal gatherings , " mohtaj said in a statement .
" should you provoke and call for these illegal rallies you will be responsible for the consequences . "
since the protests began , scores of prominent political activists , including reformist leaders and former government officials , have also been rounded up by the authorities. nda / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if this huge volume of cheating and changing the votes ... which has hurt people 's trust , is presented as the very evidence of the lack of cheating , then it will butcher the republican aspect of the system , and the idea that islam is incompatible with a republic will be proven , " mousavi said .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who last week ordered a probe into allegations of electoral fraud , had insisted in his friday sermon that the margin of ahmadinejad 's victory over mousavi meant there had been no cheating .
iran 's electoral watchdog , the 12-member guardians council , said on saturday it was ready to randomly recount up to 10 percent of the ballot boxes from the election , state television reported .
opposition leader calls for purging of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mousavi issues the strongest challenge to the ayatollah since the islamic revolution mousavi added that the islamic republic must be purged of what he called lies and dishonesty , sending out a direct challenge to conservative rulers after a week of unrest in iran .
the opposition leader , who claims victory in the poll , told supporters he was " ready for martyrdom " , according to an ally .
but he said he did not seek confrontation with the authorities .
" we are not against the islamic system and its laws but against lies and deviations and just want to reform it , " he said in a statement on his website at the end of another tumultuous day .
mousavi said if authorities refused to allow peaceful protests they would face the " consequences " – an apparent rejoinder to khamenei 's warning that opposition leaders would be held responsible for any bloodshed resulting from protests .
" the people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ...
the islamic revolution should be the way it was and the way it should be , " mousavi said .
" if the people 's trust is not matched by protecting their votes , or if they are not able to defend their rights in a civil peaceful reaction , there will be dangerous ways ahead . "
riot police out in force as protests turn violent bildunterschrift : protestors defied khamenei 's demands and faced off against security forces in tehran mousavi 's statements came after police firing tear gas and water canons clashed with thousands of protestors who defied an ultimatum from ayatollah ali khamenei for an end to their street protests .
at least one person was wounded when shots rang out during saturday 's rally as demonstrators faced off against hundreds of security personnel to assemble in enghelab -lrb- revolution -rrb- square in the heart of the capital , witnesses said .
helicopters criss-crossed tehran and ambulance sirens wailed into the night after streets emptied of protesters who had defied friday 's stern warning from khamenei during his weekly prayers .
the head of iran 's security council , abbas mohtaj , on saturday delivered a specific warning to mousavi and his supporters .
" your national duty tells you to refrain from provoking illegal gatherings , " mohtaj said in a statement .
" should you provoke and call for these illegal rallies you will be responsible for the consequences . "
since the protests began , scores of prominent political activists , including reformist leaders and former government officials , have also been rounded up by the authorities. nda / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i find this amusing and above all undignified , " klaus , whose country holds the eu presidency until the end of this month , told saturday 's edition of the pravo daily .
" we all know that it 's impossible to square the circle , but it is exactly what these countries have tried to do .
to say that the concessions do n't change anything about the lisbon treaty is silly , " he added .

" every normal human being , a first grade pupil , would know that it is a change and that somebody is promising it .

the deal struck on friday guarantees the status of a treaty protocol but will not affect the ratification of the reforms in other eu countries .
some countries , such as britain , sweden and the czech republic expressed some concerns that giving the irish a legally-binding protocol may reopen the ratification process in some member states which had already approved the treaty .
ahead of the summit , klaus – who has refused to sign off on his parliament 's endorsement until the irish vote again – insisted that the guarantees be ratified by the czech parliament too , or he would refuse to approve it .

" we all know that it 's impossible to square the circle , but it is exactly what these countries have tried to do .

the guarantees should help secure irish voters ' backing for the treaty – after rejecting the text a year ago – which aims to streamline the 27-nation bloc 's decision-making process and give it a greater say in global affairs .
the deal struck on friday guarantees the status of a treaty protocol but will not affect the ratification of the reforms in other eu countries .

amado said that the question of the ex-prisoners ' status was currently being studied by the interior ministry .
seven countries have agreed to take inmates italy announced monday that it would accept three guantanamo inmates , while spain agreed in principle to take four , dependent on their cases being reviewed by the foreign ministry .
last week nine former detainees were transferred to chad , iraq and bermuda , while the pacific island nation of palau also agreed to take in a group of 13 chinese uighurs .
portugal was the first country to press publicly for a coordinated european union resettlement plan for guantanamo prisoners back in december and is now the seventh country to take them .
the guantanamo bay prison camp was opened under former us president george w. bush to house " enemy combatants " in the government 's war on terror after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
" gitmo " , as it became known , attracted widespread international criticism for holding prisoners indefinitely , many without charge .
us president barack obama ordered the guantanamo facility closed by january of next year and the inmates either face trial or release .

the speech came just ahead of the next german islam conference in berlin . in his cairo speech , schaeuble pointed out that there was legal equality for muslims in germany .
the country 's three million muslims have " the same rights , because our state guarantees freedom of religion and is not limited to a singular world view . "
the interior minister explained it was crucial that muslims living in germany learnt the language and added that the successful integration of islam into western societies will only work if muslims accept democratic constitutions " without condition . "
" whether we like it or not , there are many people who think that islam and democracy do n't mix .
these are often people who have prejudices against islam , " schaeuble told the audience of egyptian politicians and intellectuals .
" but we must also not ignore the fact that there are some muslims who also hold this opinion , " schaeuble continued .
he warned that this minority was seeing to it “ that their opinion is heard worldwide . "
to combat anti-democratic tendencies , schaeuble also said that muslim children living in germany should receive islamic courses in german .
he supported the plan that islamic clerics in the country should also be trained at german universities .
currently most of the clerics at muslim mosques in germany have received their religious training outside of germany .
this , schaeuble stressed , could only be a temporary solution .
ahead of his speech , the german interior minister met with several representatives of the egyptian government , as well as muslim and christian clerics .
the trip to egypt comes four days ahead of the next german islam conference - which schaeuble helped initiate .

europe is soon to take the lead in the hunt , over japan . starting monday , the iwc will gather on the portuguese island of madeira for five days , looking to establish concrete rules on whale hunting .
environmentalists say trade in whale meat is increasing again , despite being illegal in most of the world .
commercial whale hunting is officially permitted in iceland and norway .
japan also allows whaling for scientific purposes - the country catches roughly 1,000 of the giants of the deep each year .
however , japanese whale meat not needed in the laboratory often ends up on restaurant menus instead .
japan has said it wants to reduce the scale of its scientific whaling , in exchange for rights to commercial whale hunting near its coastline .
" that would amount to lifting the commercial whaling ban that has been in force since 1986 , " says sandra altherr of the organization pro wildlife .

denmark is also hoping for a special whaling dispensation , trying to convince the eu to permit greenland to hunt 50 humpback whales over five years for domestic consumption .

the norwegian firm lofothval has obtained export licenses for 47 tons of whale meat .
greenpeace has said this is a sign of desperation .
" that shows the despair of the whaling industry that ca n't sell its products in norway and so is trying to get rid of them abroad at any price , " says truls gulowsen , the head of greenpeace in scandinavia .
" the japanese eat less and less whale meat and their warehouses are already full of products that the local hunters ca n't get rid of . "

" japan , that 's more than 120 million inhabitants , " said rune froevik of lofothval , admitting that many there were not accustomed to eating whale meat .
" but they are receptive , because a large part of their diet comes from the sea . "
also , the japanese eat the fat of the whale , which norwegians discard as a waste product .
" each catch becomes more profitable because a small minke whale contains 1.5 tons of meat and 500 kilos of blubber , " said froevik .

according to the international whaling commission 's scientific committee , the north atlantic has 30,000 fin whales and 174,000 minke whales .

" if this huge volume of cheating and changing the votes ... which has hurt people 's trust , is presented as the very evidence of the lack of cheating , then it will butcher the republican aspect of the system , and the idea that islam is incompatible with a republic will be proven , " mousavi said .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who last week ordered a probe into allegations of electoral fraud , had insisted in his friday sermon that the margin of ahmadinejad 's victory over mousavi meant there had been no cheating .
iran 's electoral watchdog , the 12-member guardians council , said on saturday it was ready to randomly recount up to 10 percent of the ballot boxes from the election , state television reported .
opposition leader calls for purging of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mousavi issues the strongest challenge to the ayatollah since the islamic revolution mousavi added that the islamic republic must be purged of what he called lies and dishonesty , sending out a direct challenge to conservative rulers after a week of unrest in iran .
the opposition leader , who claims victory in the poll , told supporters he was " ready for martyrdom " , according to an ally .
but he said he did not seek confrontation with the authorities .
" we are not against the islamic system and its laws but against lies and deviations and just want to reform it , " he said in a statement on his website at the end of another tumultuous day .
mousavi said if authorities refused to allow peaceful protests they would face the " consequences " – an apparent rejoinder to khamenei 's warning that opposition leaders would be held responsible for any bloodshed resulting from protests .
" the people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ...
the islamic revolution should be the way it was and the way it should be , " mousavi said .
" if the people 's trust is not matched by protecting their votes , or if they are not able to defend their rights in a civil peaceful reaction , there will be dangerous ways ahead . "
riot police out in force as protests turn violent bildunterschrift : protestors defied khamenei 's demands and faced off against security forces in tehran mousavi 's statements came after police firing tear gas and water canons clashed with thousands of protestors who defied an ultimatum from ayatollah ali khamenei for an end to their street protests .
at least one person was wounded when shots rang out during saturday 's rally as demonstrators faced off against hundreds of security personnel to assemble in enghelab -lrb- revolution -rrb- square in the heart of the capital , witnesses said .
helicopters criss-crossed tehran and ambulance sirens wailed into the night after streets emptied of protesters who had defied friday 's stern warning from khamenei during his weekly prayers .
the head of iran 's security council , abbas mohtaj , on saturday delivered a specific warning to mousavi and his supporters .
" your national duty tells you to refrain from provoking illegal gatherings , " mohtaj said in a statement .
" should you provoke and call for these illegal rallies you will be responsible for the consequences . "
since the protests began , scores of prominent political activists , including reformist leaders and former government officials , have also been rounded up by the authorities. nda / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i find this amusing and above all undignified , " klaus , whose country holds the eu presidency until the end of this month , told saturday 's edition of the pravo daily .
" we all know that it 's impossible to square the circle , but it is exactly what these countries have tried to do .
to say that the concessions do n't change anything about the lisbon treaty is silly , " he added .
" although it is written in the treaty that not all countries ... will have their own commissioner , now suddenly it is promised that they will , " klaus said .
" every normal human being , a first grade pupil , would know that it is a change and that somebody is promising it .
so it is a change , " he said .
the czech president 's comments were likely to open a debate on whether the treaty 's ratification process should be renewed just over a week before sweden takes the reigns .
ireland deal raises ratification concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is already a deeply unpopular text the european union agreed to offer the irish legal guarantees on national sovereignty at a summit in brussels on friday .
the guarantees ensured the eu 's reforming text did not hamper ireland 's military neutrality , taxation system and abortion laws .
the guarantees should help secure irish voters ' backing for the treaty – after rejecting the text a year ago – which aims to streamline the 27-nation bloc 's decision-making process and give it a greater say in global affairs .
the deal struck on friday guarantees the status of a treaty protocol but will not affect the ratification of the reforms in other eu countries .
some countries , such as britain , sweden and the czech republic expressed some concerns that giving the irish a legally-binding protocol may reopen the ratification process in some member states which had already approved the treaty .
ahead of the summit , klaus – who has refused to sign off on his parliament 's endorsement until the irish vote again – insisted that the guarantees be ratified by the czech parliament too , or he would refuse to approve it .
but czech prime minister jan fischer , who chaired the summit , said the guarantees had a treaty status and did not " inspire any desire to reopen the ratification process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 21.06.2009 trade in whale meat picking up , despite being outlawed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whaling is technically outlawed , but still common practice ahead of a meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- , environmentalists warn that global trade in whale meat is on the rise .
europe is soon to take the lead in the hunt , over japan . starting monday , the iwc will gather on the portuguese island of madeira for five days , looking to establish concrete rules on whale hunting .
environmentalists say trade in whale meat is increasing again , despite being illegal in most of the world .
commercial whale hunting is officially permitted in iceland and norway .
japan also allows whaling for scientific purposes - the country catches roughly 1,000 of the giants of the deep each year .
however , japanese whale meat not needed in the laboratory often ends up on restaurant menus instead .
japan has said it wants to reduce the scale of its scientific whaling , in exchange for rights to commercial whale hunting near its coastline .
" that would amount to lifting the commercial whaling ban that has been in force since 1986 , " says sandra altherr of the organization pro wildlife .
the three whaling nations have been pushing for an end to the international ban on trade in whale meat .
the industry is currently outlawed under the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : greenpeace members often put their lives on the line to stop whaling vessels norway and iceland reserved their right to resume hunting in this 1986 moratorium .
since then both countries have taken up the trade again , while japan circumvented the regulation by reintroducing what it calls its " scientific whaling program . "
denmark is also hoping for a special whaling dispensation , trying to convince the eu to permit greenland to hunt 50 humpback whales over five years for domestic consumption .
critics say that denmark really wants to reintroduce commercial whaling off its own shores , even though there is already plenty of whale meat available there .
flourishing trade the three nations that have rejected the moratorium are free to trade small quantities of meat amongst themselves .
after a gap of a few decades , japan started importing whale meat in 2008 .
currently japan brings in a few tons from iceland , and under 10 tons from norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whalers in scandinavia and japan say they 're just like any other fishermen the nordic nations want to increase these amounts .
the norwegian firm lofothval has obtained export licenses for 47 tons of whale meat .
greenpeace has said this is a sign of desperation .
" that shows the despair of the whaling industry that ca n't sell its products in norway and so is trying to get rid of them abroad at any price , " says truls gulowsen , the head of greenpeace in scandinavia .
" the japanese eat less and less whale meat and their warehouses are already full of products that the local hunters ca n't get rid of . "
industry professionals see the matter very differently .
for them the japanese market is a promising , large one , which offers higher prices for whale meat .
" japan , that 's more than 120 million inhabitants , " said rune froevik of lofothval , admitting that many there were not accustomed to eating whale meat .
" but they are receptive , because a large part of their diet comes from the sea . "
also , the japanese eat the fat of the whale , which norwegians discard as a waste product .
" each catch becomes more profitable because a small minke whale contains 1.5 tons of meat and 500 kilos of blubber , " said froevik .
legalised whaling ?
bildunterschrift : groups in japan have campaigned for their " seafood culture " however , they also maintain the ban on international whale hunting is no longer necessary .
" the experts , including those abroad , agree that the species we are hunting are not under threat , " said oeystein stoerkersen - the head of norway 's directorate for nature management .
" but certain decision-makers in the united states , britain , germany and france are trying to scrounge votes by pandering to ill-informed public opinion . "
those in favor of whaling want to set up a " safe haven " for whales in the south atlantic , whilst relaxing the laws for much of the rest of the world .
however , environmentalists have dismissed these ideas as farcical , saying the point of the moratorium was to make every ocean a safe refuge for whales .
according to the international whaling commission 's scientific committee , the north atlantic has 30,000 fin whales and 174,000 minke whales .
norway argues that these numbers are healthy enough to justify hunting around 1,000 of the mammalian sea creatures each year .
the 61st annual iwc meeting is another bid to agree on definitive rules for global whale hunting , but opinions remain completely polarized going into the event. msh / dpa / afp / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe is soon to take the lead in the hunt , over japan . starting monday , the iwc will gather on the portuguese island of madeira for five days , looking to establish concrete rules on whale hunting .
environmentalists say trade in whale meat is increasing again , despite being illegal in most of the world .
commercial whale hunting is officially permitted in iceland and norway .
japan also allows whaling for scientific purposes - the country catches roughly 1,000 of the giants of the deep each year .
however , japanese whale meat not needed in the laboratory often ends up on restaurant menus instead .
japan has said it wants to reduce the scale of its scientific whaling , in exchange for rights to commercial whale hunting near its coastline .
" that would amount to lifting the commercial whaling ban that has been in force since 1986 , " says sandra altherr of the organization pro wildlife .
the three whaling nations have been pushing for an end to the international ban on trade in whale meat .
the industry is currently outlawed under the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : greenpeace members often put their lives on the line to stop whaling vessels norway and iceland reserved their right to resume hunting in this 1986 moratorium .
since then both countries have taken up the trade again , while japan circumvented the regulation by reintroducing what it calls its " scientific whaling program . "
denmark is also hoping for a special whaling dispensation , trying to convince the eu to permit greenland to hunt 50 humpback whales over five years for domestic consumption .
critics say that denmark really wants to reintroduce commercial whaling off its own shores , even though there is already plenty of whale meat available there .
flourishing trade the three nations that have rejected the moratorium are free to trade small quantities of meat amongst themselves .
after a gap of a few decades , japan started importing whale meat in 2008 .
currently japan brings in a few tons from iceland , and under 10 tons from norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whalers in scandinavia and japan say they 're just like any other fishermen the nordic nations want to increase these amounts .
the norwegian firm lofothval has obtained export licenses for 47 tons of whale meat .
greenpeace has said this is a sign of desperation .
" that shows the despair of the whaling industry that ca n't sell its products in norway and so is trying to get rid of them abroad at any price , " says truls gulowsen , the head of greenpeace in scandinavia .
" the japanese eat less and less whale meat and their warehouses are already full of products that the local hunters ca n't get rid of . "
industry professionals see the matter very differently .
for them the japanese market is a promising , large one , which offers higher prices for whale meat .
" japan , that 's more than 120 million inhabitants , " said rune froevik of lofothval , admitting that many there were not accustomed to eating whale meat .
" but they are receptive , because a large part of their diet comes from the sea . "
also , the japanese eat the fat of the whale , which norwegians discard as a waste product .
" each catch becomes more profitable because a small minke whale contains 1.5 tons of meat and 500 kilos of blubber , " said froevik .
legalised whaling ?
bildunterschrift : groups in japan have campaigned for their " seafood culture " however , they also maintain the ban on international whale hunting is no longer necessary .
" the experts , including those abroad , agree that the species we are hunting are not under threat , " said oeystein stoerkersen - the head of norway 's directorate for nature management .
" but certain decision-makers in the united states , britain , germany and france are trying to scrounge votes by pandering to ill-informed public opinion . "
those in favor of whaling want to set up a " safe haven " for whales in the south atlantic , whilst relaxing the laws for much of the rest of the world .
however , environmentalists have dismissed these ideas as farcical , saying the point of the moratorium was to make every ocean a safe refuge for whales .
according to the international whaling commission 's scientific committee , the north atlantic has 30,000 fin whales and 174,000 minke whales .
norway argues that these numbers are healthy enough to justify hunting around 1,000 of the mammalian sea creatures each year .
the 61st annual iwc meeting is another bid to agree on definitive rules for global whale hunting , but opinions remain completely polarized going into the event. msh / dpa / afp / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police say they blocked entry to hundreds of radicals trying to occupy the site . police in berlin say they have thwarted an overnight attempt by many hundreds of militant left-wing demonstrators trying to occupy former tempelhof airport .
the former hub of the 1948-49 berlin airlift , once one of three berlin airports , was shut down last year , prompting renewed debate about what should happen to the site , including its iconic 1,200 meter-long terminal building built during the nazi era .
the city center airport has an area equivalent to 400 football fields and is now considered a prime property development site .
on saturday , a leftist alliance calling itself " squat tempelhof " , which wants the grounds to be opened to the public , was confronted by a large deployment of police .
a spokesman for the police said demonstrators had repeatedly tried but failed to tear down a perimeter fence .
numerous arrests were made , police said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the last aircraft to use tempelhof before its closure in 2008 the incident coincides with an ongoing debate about the legendary airfield .
last november , the berlin state government decided to turn a chunk of the site into a 250-hectare park .
events planned include pop concerts and equestrian competitions .
other ideas have included a zoo , a private hospital , a film studio and even a red-light district .
the terminal itself is a protected heritage site .
tempelhof became the world 's first airport with regular passenger service in 1923 .
shortly after world war two , a soviet blockade of west berlin forced american and british aircraft to fly in foodstuffs , fuel and other goods for the 2.2 million residents in order to ensure their survival .
tempelhof 's closure in 2008 was part of a plan to move berlin 's new international airport to schoenefeld on the city 's southern fringe in what was earlier communist east germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 21.06.2009 trade in whale meat picking up , despite being outlawed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whaling is technically outlawed , but still common practice ahead of a meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- , environmentalists warn that global trade in whale meat is on the rise .
europe is soon to take the lead in the hunt , over japan . starting monday , the iwc will gather on the portuguese island of madeira for five days , looking to establish concrete rules on whale hunting .
environmentalists say trade in whale meat is increasing again , despite being illegal in most of the world .
commercial whale hunting is officially permitted in iceland and norway .
japan also allows whaling for scientific purposes - the country catches roughly 1,000 of the giants of the deep each year .
however , japanese whale meat not needed in the laboratory often ends up on restaurant menus instead .
japan has said it wants to reduce the scale of its scientific whaling , in exchange for rights to commercial whale hunting near its coastline .
" that would amount to lifting the commercial whaling ban that has been in force since 1986 , " says sandra altherr of the organization pro wildlife .
the three whaling nations have been pushing for an end to the international ban on trade in whale meat .
the industry is currently outlawed under the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : greenpeace members often put their lives on the line to stop whaling vessels norway and iceland reserved their right to resume hunting in this 1986 moratorium .
since then both countries have taken up the trade again , while japan circumvented the regulation by reintroducing what it calls its " scientific whaling program . "
denmark is also hoping for a special whaling dispensation , trying to convince the eu to permit greenland to hunt 50 humpback whales over five years for domestic consumption .
critics say that denmark really wants to reintroduce commercial whaling off its own shores , even though there is already plenty of whale meat available there .
flourishing trade the three nations that have rejected the moratorium are free to trade small quantities of meat amongst themselves .
after a gap of a few decades , japan started importing whale meat in 2008 .
currently japan brings in a few tons from iceland , and under 10 tons from norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whalers in scandinavia and japan say they 're just like any other fishermen the nordic nations want to increase these amounts .
the norwegian firm lofothval has obtained export licenses for 47 tons of whale meat .
greenpeace has said this is a sign of desperation .
" that shows the despair of the whaling industry that ca n't sell its products in norway and so is trying to get rid of them abroad at any price , " says truls gulowsen , the head of greenpeace in scandinavia .
" the japanese eat less and less whale meat and their warehouses are already full of products that the local hunters ca n't get rid of . "
industry professionals see the matter very differently .
for them the japanese market is a promising , large one , which offers higher prices for whale meat .
" japan , that 's more than 120 million inhabitants , " said rune froevik of lofothval , admitting that many there were not accustomed to eating whale meat .
" but they are receptive , because a large part of their diet comes from the sea . "
also , the japanese eat the fat of the whale , which norwegians discard as a waste product .
" each catch becomes more profitable because a small minke whale contains 1.5 tons of meat and 500 kilos of blubber , " said froevik .
legalised whaling ?
bildunterschrift : groups in japan have campaigned for their " seafood culture " however , they also maintain the ban on international whale hunting is no longer necessary .
" the experts , including those abroad , agree that the species we are hunting are not under threat , " said oeystein stoerkersen - the head of norway 's directorate for nature management .
" but certain decision-makers in the united states , britain , germany and france are trying to scrounge votes by pandering to ill-informed public opinion . "
those in favor of whaling want to set up a " safe haven " for whales in the south atlantic , whilst relaxing the laws for much of the rest of the world .
however , environmentalists have dismissed these ideas as farcical , saying the point of the moratorium was to make every ocean a safe refuge for whales .
according to the international whaling commission 's scientific committee , the north atlantic has 30,000 fin whales and 174,000 minke whales .
norway argues that these numbers are healthy enough to justify hunting around 1,000 of the mammalian sea creatures each year .
the 61st annual iwc meeting is another bid to agree on definitive rules for global whale hunting , but opinions remain completely polarized going into the event. msh / dpa / afp / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will accept two or three prisoners .
now , it 's up to us , internally , to carry out the necessary procedures to welcome them , " foreign minister luis amado said after a visit to lisbon by us special envoy daniel fried , the man charge with finding host countries for more than 200 detainees washington has chosen not to prosecute .
amado said that the question of the ex-prisoners ' status was currently being studied by the interior ministry .
seven countries have agreed to take inmates italy announced monday that it would accept three guantanamo inmates , while spain agreed in principle to take four , dependent on their cases being reviewed by the foreign ministry .
last week nine former detainees were transferred to chad , iraq and bermuda , while the pacific island nation of palau also agreed to take in a group of 13 chinese uighurs .
portugal was the first country to press publicly for a coordinated european union resettlement plan for guantanamo prisoners back in december and is now the seventh country to take them .
the guantanamo bay prison camp was opened under former us president george w. bush to house " enemy combatants " in the government 's war on terror after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
" gitmo " , as it became known , attracted widespread international criticism for holding prisoners indefinitely , many without charge .
us president barack obama ordered the guantanamo facility closed by january of next year and the inmates either face trial or release .
washington has since been pushing for other countries to accept inmates who have not been charged and are ready to be released. nda / afp / reuters editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if this huge volume of cheating and changing the votes ... which has hurt people 's trust , is presented as the very evidence of the lack of cheating , then it will butcher the republican aspect of the system , and the idea that islam is incompatible with a republic will be proven , " mousavi said .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who last week ordered a probe into allegations of electoral fraud , had insisted in his friday sermon that the margin of ahmadinejad 's victory over mousavi meant there had been no cheating .
iran 's electoral watchdog , the 12-member guardians council , said on saturday it was ready to randomly recount up to 10 percent of the ballot boxes from the election , state television reported .
opposition leader calls for purging of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mousavi issues the strongest challenge to the ayatollah since the islamic revolution mousavi added that the islamic republic must be purged of what he called lies and dishonesty , sending out a direct challenge to conservative rulers after a week of unrest in iran .
the opposition leader , who claims victory in the poll , told supporters he was " ready for martyrdom " , according to an ally .
but he said he did not seek confrontation with the authorities .
" we are not against the islamic system and its laws but against lies and deviations and just want to reform it , " he said in a statement on his website at the end of another tumultuous day .
mousavi said if authorities refused to allow peaceful protests they would face the " consequences " – an apparent rejoinder to khamenei 's warning that opposition leaders would be held responsible for any bloodshed resulting from protests .
" the people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ...
the islamic revolution should be the way it was and the way it should be , " mousavi said .
" if the people 's trust is not matched by protecting their votes , or if they are not able to defend their rights in a civil peaceful reaction , there will be dangerous ways ahead . "
riot police out in force as protests turn violent bildunterschrift : protestors defied khamenei 's demands and faced off against security forces in tehran mousavi 's statements came after police firing tear gas and water canons clashed with thousands of protestors who defied an ultimatum from ayatollah ali khamenei for an end to their street protests .
at least one person was wounded when shots rang out during saturday 's rally as demonstrators faced off against hundreds of security personnel to assemble in enghelab -lrb- revolution -rrb- square in the heart of the capital , witnesses said .
helicopters criss-crossed tehran and ambulance sirens wailed into the night after streets emptied of protesters who had defied friday 's stern warning from khamenei during his weekly prayers .
the head of iran 's security council , abbas mohtaj , on saturday delivered a specific warning to mousavi and his supporters .
" your national duty tells you to refrain from provoking illegal gatherings , " mohtaj said in a statement .
" should you provoke and call for these illegal rallies you will be responsible for the consequences . "
since the protests began , scores of prominent political activists , including reformist leaders and former government officials , have also been rounded up by the authorities. nda / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if this huge volume of cheating and changing the votes ... which has hurt people 's trust , is presented as the very evidence of the lack of cheating , then it will butcher the republican aspect of the system , and the idea that islam is incompatible with a republic will be proven , " mousavi said .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who last week ordered a probe into allegations of electoral fraud , had insisted in his friday sermon that the margin of ahmadinejad 's victory over mousavi meant there had been no cheating .
iran 's electoral watchdog , the 12-member guardians council , said on saturday it was ready to randomly recount up to 10 percent of the ballot boxes from the election , state television reported .
opposition leader calls for purging of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mousavi issues the strongest challenge to the ayatollah since the islamic revolution mousavi added that the islamic republic must be purged of what he called lies and dishonesty , sending out a direct challenge to conservative rulers after a week of unrest in iran .
the opposition leader , who claims victory in the poll , told supporters he was " ready for martyrdom " , according to an ally .
but he said he did not seek confrontation with the authorities .
" we are not against the islamic system and its laws but against lies and deviations and just want to reform it , " he said in a statement on his website at the end of another tumultuous day .
mousavi said if authorities refused to allow peaceful protests they would face the " consequences " – an apparent rejoinder to khamenei 's warning that opposition leaders would be held responsible for any bloodshed resulting from protests .
" the people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ...
the islamic revolution should be the way it was and the way it should be , " mousavi said .

" if this huge volume of cheating and changing the votes ... which has hurt people 's trust , is presented as the very evidence of the lack of cheating , then it will butcher the republican aspect of the system , and the idea that islam is incompatible with a republic will be proven , " mousavi said .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who last week ordered a probe into allegations of electoral fraud , had insisted in his friday sermon that the margin of ahmadinejad 's victory over mousavi meant there had been no cheating .
iran 's electoral watchdog , the 12-member guardians council , said on saturday it was ready to randomly recount up to 10 percent of the ballot boxes from the election , state television reported .
opposition leader calls for purging of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mousavi issues the strongest challenge to the ayatollah since the islamic revolution mousavi added that the islamic republic must be purged of what he called lies and dishonesty , sending out a direct challenge to conservative rulers after a week of unrest in iran .
the opposition leader , who claims victory in the poll , told supporters he was " ready for martyrdom " , according to an ally .
but he said he did not seek confrontation with the authorities .
" we are not against the islamic system and its laws but against lies and deviations and just want to reform it , " he said in a statement on his website at the end of another tumultuous day .
mousavi said if authorities refused to allow peaceful protests they would face the " consequences " – an apparent rejoinder to khamenei 's warning that opposition leaders would be held responsible for any bloodshed resulting from protests .
" the people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ...
the islamic revolution should be the way it was and the way it should be , " mousavi said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 21.06.2009 trade in whale meat picking up , despite being outlawed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whaling is technically outlawed , but still common practice ahead of a meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- , environmentalists warn that global trade in whale meat is on the rise .
europe is soon to take the lead in the hunt , over japan . starting monday , the iwc will gather on the portuguese island of madeira for five days , looking to establish concrete rules on whale hunting .
environmentalists say trade in whale meat is increasing again , despite being illegal in most of the world .
commercial whale hunting is officially permitted in iceland and norway .
japan also allows whaling for scientific purposes - the country catches roughly 1,000 of the giants of the deep each year .
however , japanese whale meat not needed in the laboratory often ends up on restaurant menus instead .
japan has said it wants to reduce the scale of its scientific whaling , in exchange for rights to commercial whale hunting near its coastline .
" that would amount to lifting the commercial whaling ban that has been in force since 1986 , " says sandra altherr of the organization pro wildlife .
the three whaling nations have been pushing for an end to the international ban on trade in whale meat .
the industry is currently outlawed under the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : greenpeace members often put their lives on the line to stop whaling vessels norway and iceland reserved their right to resume hunting in this 1986 moratorium .
since then both countries have taken up the trade again , while japan circumvented the regulation by reintroducing what it calls its " scientific whaling program . "
denmark is also hoping for a special whaling dispensation , trying to convince the eu to permit greenland to hunt 50 humpback whales over five years for domestic consumption .
critics say that denmark really wants to reintroduce commercial whaling off its own shores , even though there is already plenty of whale meat available there .
flourishing trade the three nations that have rejected the moratorium are free to trade small quantities of meat amongst themselves .
after a gap of a few decades , japan started importing whale meat in 2008 .
currently japan brings in a few tons from iceland , and under 10 tons from norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whalers in scandinavia and japan say they 're just like any other fishermen the nordic nations want to increase these amounts .
the norwegian firm lofothval has obtained export licenses for 47 tons of whale meat .
greenpeace has said this is a sign of desperation .
" that shows the despair of the whaling industry that ca n't sell its products in norway and so is trying to get rid of them abroad at any price , " says truls gulowsen , the head of greenpeace in scandinavia .
" the japanese eat less and less whale meat and their warehouses are already full of products that the local hunters ca n't get rid of . "
industry professionals see the matter very differently .
for them the japanese market is a promising , large one , which offers higher prices for whale meat .
" japan , that 's more than 120 million inhabitants , " said rune froevik of lofothval , admitting that many there were not accustomed to eating whale meat .
" but they are receptive , because a large part of their diet comes from the sea . "
also , the japanese eat the fat of the whale , which norwegians discard as a waste product .
" each catch becomes more profitable because a small minke whale contains 1.5 tons of meat and 500 kilos of blubber , " said froevik .
legalised whaling ?
bildunterschrift : groups in japan have campaigned for their " seafood culture " however , they also maintain the ban on international whale hunting is no longer necessary .
" the experts , including those abroad , agree that the species we are hunting are not under threat , " said oeystein stoerkersen - the head of norway 's directorate for nature management .
" but certain decision-makers in the united states , britain , germany and france are trying to scrounge votes by pandering to ill-informed public opinion . "
those in favor of whaling want to set up a " safe haven " for whales in the south atlantic , whilst relaxing the laws for much of the rest of the world .
however , environmentalists have dismissed these ideas as farcical , saying the point of the moratorium was to make every ocean a safe refuge for whales .
according to the international whaling commission 's scientific committee , the north atlantic has 30,000 fin whales and 174,000 minke whales .
norway argues that these numbers are healthy enough to justify hunting around 1,000 of the mammalian sea creatures each year .
the 61st annual iwc meeting is another bid to agree on definitive rules for global whale hunting , but opinions remain completely polarized going into the event. msh / dpa / afp / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 21.06.2009 parisian undercover artist veils kate moss and co . großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess hijab turning ads into art in france , a political debate is raging over the burqa - the full body hijab .
70 parlamentarians have signed a petition to outlaw them , a parisian graffiti artist is turning models into manifests - with sprayed-on veils . even though no one knows who " princess hijab " really is , visitors to paris will recognize her art immediately .
working under a cloak of darkness , armed with black spray paint and a permanent marker , the graffiti artist covers posters of sexy models with cloaks of their own : burqas .
topmodel kate moss in a veil , actor owen wilson in a hijab - and suddenly , their shining smiles seem ironic .
the phantom has struck again , on one of the city 's most frequented subway stops : the paris opera .
is it art ?
or a religious statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all across paris you can find the works of " princess hijab " the princess is a mystery , even for graffiti insiders .
an internet search reveals a chaotic webpage with a strange manifesto .
" visual terrorism , " " artistic jihad " and " revenge for a good cause " are some of the slogans the guerilla street artist uses .
she says she wants to " hijabize " advertising , in the same vein as the anti-consumerist adbuster movement that began in canada in 1989 .
but on her myspace site , princess hijab seems to exude girl power .
the black and white page drips with red , portraying a drawing of a young woman wearing a printed scarf and a pirate eye patch while dance music plays .
the artist claims to be a 21-year-old girl , who is " disgusted . "
" jihad is her art " but in a telephone interview , princess hijab did unveil herself a bit more .
" all of these terms - visual terrorism , jihad - they are all coded , " she said .
" of course , they have a certain weight and an emotional importance , but i try to separate them from their context .
for me , it is more of an attitude , a metaphor .
and the ' noble cause ' is to demand the right to a counterstatement from images in the public sphere . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the short-short birqa conceal more than reveal ?
" princess hijab " has been bombarding the internet and the walls of paris , veiling poster girls and boys , since 2006 .
for her its not a matter of islam , but rather of artistic self realization .
" the veil has plenty of different meanings : it can be religious or secular ; it can form your identity or alienate it , " the young artist said .
" and gives me the opportunity to fight on several fronts , to remain hidden and create an alternative personality for myself .
it sets me apart from other artists in france . "
offensive veils she herself is not muslim , she said .
and certainly not prude .
her " hijabized " women are presented with mini skirts , high heels and some even with guns - and opinion is divided over her work .
on the one hand , western critics regard princess hijab as too islamic , too propagandistic .
but muslim critics complain that her " coverage " is only show - there 's still too much skin revealed .
however , the fact that the veil has a mere decorative function does n't seem to bother fans nor critics .
" those who are interested in my work are atheists , feminists and muslims .
i think that i have touched upon an issue here that does not need justificiation , " princess hijab says .
in the end , everybody has the freedom to interpret her activities whichever way they want .

" we all know that it 's impossible to square the circle , but it is exactly what these countries have tried to do .

the deal struck on friday guarantees the status of a treaty protocol but will not affect the ratification of the reforms in other eu countries .
some countries , such as britain , sweden and the czech republic expressed some concerns that giving the irish a legally-binding protocol may reopen the ratification process in some member states which had already approved the treaty .
ahead of the summit , klaus – who has refused to sign off on his parliament 's endorsement until the irish vote again – insisted that the guarantees be ratified by the czech parliament too , or he would refuse to approve it .

police say they blocked entry to hundreds of radicals trying to occupy the site . police in berlin say they have thwarted an overnight attempt by many hundreds of militant left-wing demonstrators trying to occupy former tempelhof airport .
the former hub of the 1948-49 berlin airlift , once one of three berlin airports , was shut down last year , prompting renewed debate about what should happen to the site , including its iconic 1,200 meter-long terminal building built during the nazi era .
the city center airport has an area equivalent to 400 football fields and is now considered a prime property development site .
on saturday , a leftist alliance calling itself " squat tempelhof " , which wants the grounds to be opened to the public , was confronted by a large deployment of police .
a spokesman for the police said demonstrators had repeatedly tried but failed to tear down a perimeter fence .
numerous arrests were made , police said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the last aircraft to use tempelhof before its closure in 2008 the incident coincides with an ongoing debate about the legendary airfield .
last november , the berlin state government decided to turn a chunk of the site into a 250-hectare park .
events planned include pop concerts and equestrian competitions .
other ideas have included a zoo , a private hospital , a film studio and even a red-light district .
the terminal itself is a protected heritage site .
tempelhof became the world 's first airport with regular passenger service in 1923 .
shortly after world war two , a soviet blockade of west berlin forced american and british aircraft to fly in foodstuffs , fuel and other goods for the 2.2 million residents in order to ensure their survival .
tempelhof 's closure in 2008 was part of a plan to move berlin 's new international airport to schoenefeld on the city 's southern fringe in what was earlier communist east germany .

" if this huge volume of cheating and changing the votes ... which has hurt people 's trust , is presented as the very evidence of the lack of cheating , then it will butcher the republican aspect of the system , and the idea that islam is incompatible with a republic will be proven , " mousavi said .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who last week ordered a probe into allegations of electoral fraud , had insisted in his friday sermon that the margin of ahmadinejad 's victory over mousavi meant there had been no cheating .

" we are not against the islamic system and its laws but against lies and deviations and just want to reform it , " he said in a statement on his website at the end of another tumultuous day .
mousavi said if authorities refused to allow peaceful protests they would face the " consequences " – an apparent rejoinder to khamenei 's warning that opposition leaders would be held responsible for any bloodshed resulting from protests .
" the people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ...

" if this huge volume of cheating and changing the votes ... which has hurt people 's trust , is presented as the very evidence of the lack of cheating , then it will butcher the republican aspect of the system , and the idea that islam is incompatible with a republic will be proven , " mousavi said .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who last week ordered a probe into allegations of electoral fraud , had insisted in his friday sermon that the margin of ahmadinejad 's victory over mousavi meant there had been no cheating .
iran 's electoral watchdog , the 12-member guardians council , said on saturday it was ready to randomly recount up to 10 percent of the ballot boxes from the election , state television reported .
opposition leader calls for purging of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mousavi issues the strongest challenge to the ayatollah since the islamic revolution mousavi added that the islamic republic must be purged of what he called lies and dishonesty , sending out a direct challenge to conservative rulers after a week of unrest in iran .
the opposition leader , who claims victory in the poll , told supporters he was " ready for martyrdom " , according to an ally .
but he said he did not seek confrontation with the authorities .
" we are not against the islamic system and its laws but against lies and deviations and just want to reform it , " he said in a statement on his website at the end of another tumultuous day .
mousavi said if authorities refused to allow peaceful protests they would face the " consequences " – an apparent rejoinder to khamenei 's warning that opposition leaders would be held responsible for any bloodshed resulting from protests .
" the people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ...
the islamic revolution should be the way it was and the way it should be , " mousavi said .
" if the people 's trust is not matched by protecting their votes , or if they are not able to defend their rights in a civil peaceful reaction , there will be dangerous ways ahead . "
riot police out in force as protests turn violent bildunterschrift : protestors defied khamenei 's demands and faced off against security forces in tehran mousavi 's statements came after police firing tear gas and water canons clashed with thousands of protestors who defied an ultimatum from ayatollah ali khamenei for an end to their street protests .
at least one person was wounded when shots rang out during saturday 's rally as demonstrators faced off against hundreds of security personnel to assemble in enghelab -lrb- revolution -rrb- square in the heart of the capital , witnesses said .
helicopters criss-crossed tehran and ambulance sirens wailed into the night after streets emptied of protesters who had defied friday 's stern warning from khamenei during his weekly prayers .
the head of iran 's security council , abbas mohtaj , on saturday delivered a specific warning to mousavi and his supporters .
" your national duty tells you to refrain from provoking illegal gatherings , " mohtaj said in a statement .
" should you provoke and call for these illegal rallies you will be responsible for the consequences . "
since the protests began , scores of prominent political activists , including reformist leaders and former government officials , have also been rounded up by the authorities. nda / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ...
the islamic revolution should be the way it was and the way it should be , " mousavi said .
" if the people 's trust is not matched by protecting their votes , or if they are not able to defend their rights in a civil peaceful reaction , there will be dangerous ways ahead . "
riot police out in force as protests turn violent bildunterschrift : protestors defied khamenei 's demands and faced off against security forces in tehran mousavi 's statements came after police firing tear gas and water canons clashed with thousands of protestors who defied an ultimatum from ayatollah ali khamenei for an end to their street protests .
at least one person was wounded when shots rang out during saturday 's rally as demonstrators faced off against hundreds of security personnel to assemble in enghelab -lrb- revolution -rrb- square in the heart of the capital , witnesses said .
helicopters criss-crossed tehran and ambulance sirens wailed into the night after streets emptied of protesters who had defied friday 's stern warning from khamenei during his weekly prayers .
the head of iran 's security council , abbas mohtaj , on saturday delivered a specific warning to mousavi and his supporters .
" your national duty tells you to refrain from provoking illegal gatherings , " mohtaj said in a statement .
" should you provoke and call for these illegal rallies you will be responsible for the consequences . "
since the protests began , scores of prominent political activists , including reformist leaders and former government officials , have also been rounded up by the authorities. nda / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

championship leader jenson button struggled home in sixth place . vettel 's third career win was largely similar to his first two : he started from pole position , led for the majority of the race and was never seriously challenged .
he pulled clear from the start and delivered a perfectly judged drive to dominate the race at silverstone .
the 21-year-old came in ahead of red bull teammate mark webber and rubens barrichello of brawn gp . the victory was vettel 's second this season , and his first on a dry circuit .
" thank you very much guys , this is a dream coming true .
we 've von the british grand prix , " he said over the team radio after taking the checkered flag .
after all the political chicanery over the past three days , the race was a more predictable affair with a huge crowd and a paddock packed with celebrities , who were treated to a demonstration drive by vettel .
button maintains lead brawn 's jenson button , who leads the championship , started sixth , but fell to ninth after the opening lap .
he worked himself back into the points and then made up two places at his second pitstop , when he switched back to softer tires .
his brawn struggled with its obligatory stint on the harder rubber compound , with the briton unable to get enough heat into the tires .
in the end , button managed a disappointing sixth place and sees his overall advantage trimmed to 23 points over rubens barichello .
but despite the setback , button maintains his comfortable lead in the driver 's standings with 64 points from eight races , followed by barichello on 41 and with vettel a distant third , on 39 points .

the speech came just ahead of the next german islam conference in berlin . in his cairo speech , schaeuble pointed out that there was legal equality for muslims in germany .
the country 's three million muslims have " the same rights , because our state guarantees freedom of religion and is not limited to a singular world view . "
the interior minister explained it was crucial that muslims living in germany learnt the language and added that the successful integration of islam into western societies will only work if muslims accept democratic constitutions " without condition . "
" whether we like it or not , there are many people who think that islam and democracy do n't mix .
these are often people who have prejudices against islam , " schaeuble told the audience of egyptian politicians and intellectuals .
" but we must also not ignore the fact that there are some muslims who also hold this opinion , " schaeuble continued .
he warned that this minority was seeing to it “ that their opinion is heard worldwide . "
to combat anti-democratic tendencies , schaeuble also said that muslim children living in germany should receive islamic courses in german .
he supported the plan that islamic clerics in the country should also be trained at german universities .
currently most of the clerics at muslim mosques in germany have received their religious training outside of germany .
this , schaeuble stressed , could only be a temporary solution .
ahead of his speech , the german interior minister met with several representatives of the egyptian government , as well as muslim and christian clerics .
the trip to egypt comes four days ahead of the next german islam conference - which schaeuble helped initiate .
the conference will begin on thursday in berlin. ai / dpa / kna editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if this huge volume of cheating and changing the votes ... which has hurt people 's trust , is presented as the very evidence of the lack of cheating , then it will butcher the republican aspect of the system , and the idea that islam is incompatible with a republic will be proven , " mousavi said .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who last week ordered a probe into allegations of electoral fraud , had insisted in his friday sermon that the margin of ahmadinejad 's victory over mousavi meant there had been no cheating .
iran 's electoral watchdog , the 12-member guardians council , said on saturday it was ready to randomly recount up to 10 percent of the ballot boxes from the election , state television reported .
opposition leader calls for purging of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mousavi issues the strongest challenge to the ayatollah since the islamic revolution mousavi added that the islamic republic must be purged of what he called lies and dishonesty , sending out a direct challenge to conservative rulers after a week of unrest in iran .
the opposition leader , who claims victory in the poll , told supporters he was " ready for martyrdom " , according to an ally .
but he said he did not seek confrontation with the authorities .
" we are not against the islamic system and its laws but against lies and deviations and just want to reform it , " he said in a statement on his website at the end of another tumultuous day .
mousavi said if authorities refused to allow peaceful protests they would face the " consequences " – an apparent rejoinder to khamenei 's warning that opposition leaders would be held responsible for any bloodshed resulting from protests .
" the people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ...
the islamic revolution should be the way it was and the way it should be , " mousavi said .
" if the people 's trust is not matched by protecting their votes , or if they are not able to defend their rights in a civil peaceful reaction , there will be dangerous ways ahead . "
riot police out in force as protests turn violent bildunterschrift : protestors defied khamenei 's demands and faced off against security forces in tehran mousavi 's statements came after police firing tear gas and water canons clashed with thousands of protestors who defied an ultimatum from ayatollah ali khamenei for an end to their street protests .
at least one person was wounded when shots rang out during saturday 's rally as demonstrators faced off against hundreds of security personnel to assemble in enghelab -lrb- revolution -rrb- square in the heart of the capital , witnesses said .
helicopters criss-crossed tehran and ambulance sirens wailed into the night after streets emptied of protesters who had defied friday 's stern warning from khamenei during his weekly prayers .
the head of iran 's security council , abbas mohtaj , on saturday delivered a specific warning to mousavi and his supporters .
" your national duty tells you to refrain from provoking illegal gatherings , " mohtaj said in a statement .
" should you provoke and call for these illegal rallies you will be responsible for the consequences . "

" if this huge volume of cheating and changing the votes ... which has hurt people 's trust , is presented as the very evidence of the lack of cheating , then it will butcher the republican aspect of the system , and the idea that islam is incompatible with a republic will be proven , " mousavi said .
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who last week ordered a probe into allegations of electoral fraud , had insisted in his friday sermon that the margin of ahmadinejad 's victory over mousavi meant there had been no cheating .
iran 's electoral watchdog , the 12-member guardians council , said on saturday it was ready to randomly recount up to 10 percent of the ballot boxes from the election , state television reported .
opposition leader calls for purging of the republic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mousavi issues the strongest challenge to the ayatollah since the islamic revolution mousavi added that the islamic republic must be purged of what he called lies and dishonesty , sending out a direct challenge to conservative rulers after a week of unrest in iran .
the opposition leader , who claims victory in the poll , told supporters he was " ready for martyrdom " , according to an ally .
but he said he did not seek confrontation with the authorities .
" we are not against the islamic system and its laws but against lies and deviations and just want to reform it , " he said in a statement on his website at the end of another tumultuous day .
mousavi said if authorities refused to allow peaceful protests they would face the " consequences " – an apparent rejoinder to khamenei 's warning that opposition leaders would be held responsible for any bloodshed resulting from protests .
" the people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ...
the islamic revolution should be the way it was and the way it should be , " mousavi said .

" we will accept two or three prisoners .
now , it 's up to us , internally , to carry out the necessary procedures to welcome them , " foreign minister luis amado said after a visit to lisbon by us special envoy daniel fried , the man charge with finding host countries for more than 200 detainees washington has chosen not to prosecute .
amado said that the question of the ex-prisoners ' status was currently being studied by the interior ministry .
seven countries have agreed to take inmates italy announced monday that it would accept three guantanamo inmates , while spain agreed in principle to take four , dependent on their cases being reviewed by the foreign ministry .
last week nine former detainees were transferred to chad , iraq and bermuda , while the pacific island nation of palau also agreed to take in a group of 13 chinese uighurs .
portugal was the first country to press publicly for a coordinated european union resettlement plan for guantanamo prisoners back in december and is now the seventh country to take them .
the guantanamo bay prison camp was opened under former us president george w. bush to house " enemy combatants " in the government 's war on terror after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
" gitmo " , as it became known , attracted widespread international criticism for holding prisoners indefinitely , many without charge .
us president barack obama ordered the guantanamo facility closed by january of next year and the inmates either face trial or release .
washington has since been pushing for other countries to accept inmates who have not been charged and are ready to be released. nda / afp / reuters editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 21.06.2009 trade in whale meat picking up , despite being outlawed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whaling is technically outlawed , but still common practice ahead of a meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- , environmentalists warn that global trade in whale meat is on the rise .
europe is soon to take the lead in the hunt , over japan . starting monday , the iwc will gather on the portuguese island of madeira for five days , looking to establish concrete rules on whale hunting .
environmentalists say trade in whale meat is increasing again , despite being illegal in most of the world .
commercial whale hunting is officially permitted in iceland and norway .
japan also allows whaling for scientific purposes - the country catches roughly 1,000 of the giants of the deep each year .
however , japanese whale meat not needed in the laboratory often ends up on restaurant menus instead .
japan has said it wants to reduce the scale of its scientific whaling , in exchange for rights to commercial whale hunting near its coastline .
" that would amount to lifting the commercial whaling ban that has been in force since 1986 , " says sandra altherr of the organization pro wildlife .
the three whaling nations have been pushing for an end to the international ban on trade in whale meat .
the industry is currently outlawed under the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : greenpeace members often put their lives on the line to stop whaling vessels norway and iceland reserved their right to resume hunting in this 1986 moratorium .
since then both countries have taken up the trade again , while japan circumvented the regulation by reintroducing what it calls its " scientific whaling program . "
denmark is also hoping for a special whaling dispensation , trying to convince the eu to permit greenland to hunt 50 humpback whales over five years for domestic consumption .
critics say that denmark really wants to reintroduce commercial whaling off its own shores , even though there is already plenty of whale meat available there .
flourishing trade the three nations that have rejected the moratorium are free to trade small quantities of meat amongst themselves .
after a gap of a few decades , japan started importing whale meat in 2008 .
currently japan brings in a few tons from iceland , and under 10 tons from norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whalers in scandinavia and japan say they 're just like any other fishermen the nordic nations want to increase these amounts .
the norwegian firm lofothval has obtained export licenses for 47 tons of whale meat .
greenpeace has said this is a sign of desperation .
" that shows the despair of the whaling industry that ca n't sell its products in norway and so is trying to get rid of them abroad at any price , " says truls gulowsen , the head of greenpeace in scandinavia .
" the japanese eat less and less whale meat and their warehouses are already full of products that the local hunters ca n't get rid of . "
industry professionals see the matter very differently .
for them the japanese market is a promising , large one , which offers higher prices for whale meat .
" japan , that 's more than 120 million inhabitants , " said rune froevik of lofothval , admitting that many there were not accustomed to eating whale meat .
" but they are receptive , because a large part of their diet comes from the sea . "
also , the japanese eat the fat of the whale , which norwegians discard as a waste product .
" each catch becomes more profitable because a small minke whale contains 1.5 tons of meat and 500 kilos of blubber , " said froevik .
legalised whaling ?
bildunterschrift : groups in japan have campaigned for their " seafood culture " however , they also maintain the ban on international whale hunting is no longer necessary .
" the experts , including those abroad , agree that the species we are hunting are not under threat , " said oeystein stoerkersen - the head of norway 's directorate for nature management .
" but certain decision-makers in the united states , britain , germany and france are trying to scrounge votes by pandering to ill-informed public opinion . "
those in favor of whaling want to set up a " safe haven " for whales in the south atlantic , whilst relaxing the laws for much of the rest of the world .
however , environmentalists have dismissed these ideas as farcical , saying the point of the moratorium was to make every ocean a safe refuge for whales .
according to the international whaling commission 's scientific committee , the north atlantic has 30,000 fin whales and 174,000 minke whales .
norway argues that these numbers are healthy enough to justify hunting around 1,000 of the mammalian sea creatures each year .
the 61st annual iwc meeting is another bid to agree on definitive rules for global whale hunting , but opinions remain completely polarized going into the event. msh / dpa / afp / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the speech came just ahead of the next german islam conference in berlin . in his cairo speech , schaeuble pointed out that there was legal equality for muslims in germany .
the country 's three million muslims have " the same rights , because our state guarantees freedom of religion and is not limited to a singular world view . "
the interior minister explained it was crucial that muslims living in germany learnt the language and added that the successful integration of islam into western societies will only work if muslims accept democratic constitutions " without condition . "
" whether we like it or not , there are many people who think that islam and democracy do n't mix .
these are often people who have prejudices against islam , " schaeuble told the audience of egyptian politicians and intellectuals .
" but we must also not ignore the fact that there are some muslims who also hold this opinion , " schaeuble continued .
he warned that this minority was seeing to it “ that their opinion is heard worldwide . "
to combat anti-democratic tendencies , schaeuble also said that muslim children living in germany should receive islamic courses in german .
he supported the plan that islamic clerics in the country should also be trained at german universities .
currently most of the clerics at muslim mosques in germany have received their religious training outside of germany .
this , schaeuble stressed , could only be a temporary solution .
ahead of his speech , the german interior minister met with several representatives of the egyptian government , as well as muslim and christian clerics .

" i find this amusing and above all undignified , " klaus , whose country holds the eu presidency until the end of this month , told saturday 's edition of the pravo daily .
" we all know that it 's impossible to square the circle , but it is exactly what these countries have tried to do .
to say that the concessions do n't change anything about the lisbon treaty is silly , " he added .
" although it is written in the treaty that not all countries ... will have their own commissioner , now suddenly it is promised that they will , " klaus said .
" every normal human being , a first grade pupil , would know that it is a change and that somebody is promising it .
so it is a change , " he said .

ireland deal raises ratification concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty is already a deeply unpopular text the european union agreed to offer the irish legal guarantees on national sovereignty at a summit in brussels on friday .
the guarantees ensured the eu 's reforming text did not hamper ireland 's military neutrality , taxation system and abortion laws .
the guarantees should help secure irish voters ' backing for the treaty – after rejecting the text a year ago – which aims to streamline the 27-nation bloc 's decision-making process and give it a greater say in global affairs .
the deal struck on friday guarantees the status of a treaty protocol but will not affect the ratification of the reforms in other eu countries .
some countries , such as britain , sweden and the czech republic expressed some concerns that giving the irish a legally-binding protocol may reopen the ratification process in some member states which had already approved the treaty .
ahead of the summit , klaus – who has refused to sign off on his parliament 's endorsement until the irish vote again – insisted that the guarantees be ratified by the czech parliament too , or he would refuse to approve it .
but czech prime minister jan fischer , who chaired the summit , said the guarantees had a treaty status and did not " inspire any desire to reopen the ratification process .

the speech came just ahead of the next german islam conference in berlin . in his cairo speech , schaeuble pointed out that there was legal equality for muslims in germany .
the country 's three million muslims have " the same rights , because our state guarantees freedom of religion and is not limited to a singular world view . "
the interior minister explained it was crucial that muslims living in germany learnt the language and added that the successful integration of islam into western societies will only work if muslims accept democratic constitutions " without condition . "
" whether we like it or not , there are many people who think that islam and democracy do n't mix .
these are often people who have prejudices against islam , " schaeuble told the audience of egyptian politicians and intellectuals .
" but we must also not ignore the fact that there are some muslims who also hold this opinion , " schaeuble continued .
he warned that this minority was seeing to it “ that their opinion is heard worldwide . "
to combat anti-democratic tendencies , schaeuble also said that muslim children living in germany should receive islamic courses in german .
he supported the plan that islamic clerics in the country should also be trained at german universities .
currently most of the clerics at muslim mosques in germany have received their religious training outside of germany .
this , schaeuble stressed , could only be a temporary solution .
ahead of his speech , the german interior minister met with several representatives of the egyptian government , as well as muslim and christian clerics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 21.06.2009 trade in whale meat picking up , despite being outlawed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whaling is technically outlawed , but still common practice ahead of a meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- , environmentalists warn that global trade in whale meat is on the rise .
europe is soon to take the lead in the hunt , over japan . starting monday , the iwc will gather on the portuguese island of madeira for five days , looking to establish concrete rules on whale hunting .
environmentalists say trade in whale meat is increasing again , despite being illegal in most of the world .
commercial whale hunting is officially permitted in iceland and norway .
japan also allows whaling for scientific purposes - the country catches roughly 1,000 of the giants of the deep each year .
however , japanese whale meat not needed in the laboratory often ends up on restaurant menus instead .
japan has said it wants to reduce the scale of its scientific whaling , in exchange for rights to commercial whale hunting near its coastline .
" that would amount to lifting the commercial whaling ban that has been in force since 1986 , " says sandra altherr of the organization pro wildlife .
the three whaling nations have been pushing for an end to the international ban on trade in whale meat .
the industry is currently outlawed under the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : greenpeace members often put their lives on the line to stop whaling vessels norway and iceland reserved their right to resume hunting in this 1986 moratorium .
since then both countries have taken up the trade again , while japan circumvented the regulation by reintroducing what it calls its " scientific whaling program . "
denmark is also hoping for a special whaling dispensation , trying to convince the eu to permit greenland to hunt 50 humpback whales over five years for domestic consumption .
critics say that denmark really wants to reintroduce commercial whaling off its own shores , even though there is already plenty of whale meat available there .
flourishing trade the three nations that have rejected the moratorium are free to trade small quantities of meat amongst themselves .
after a gap of a few decades , japan started importing whale meat in 2008 .
currently japan brings in a few tons from iceland , and under 10 tons from norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whalers in scandinavia and japan say they 're just like any other fishermen the nordic nations want to increase these amounts .
the norwegian firm lofothval has obtained export licenses for 47 tons of whale meat .
greenpeace has said this is a sign of desperation .
" that shows the despair of the whaling industry that ca n't sell its products in norway and so is trying to get rid of them abroad at any price , " says truls gulowsen , the head of greenpeace in scandinavia .
" the japanese eat less and less whale meat and their warehouses are already full of products that the local hunters ca n't get rid of . "
industry professionals see the matter very differently .
for them the japanese market is a promising , large one , which offers higher prices for whale meat .
" japan , that 's more than 120 million inhabitants , " said rune froevik of lofothval , admitting that many there were not accustomed to eating whale meat .
" but they are receptive , because a large part of their diet comes from the sea . "
also , the japanese eat the fat of the whale , which norwegians discard as a waste product .
" each catch becomes more profitable because a small minke whale contains 1.5 tons of meat and 500 kilos of blubber , " said froevik .
legalised whaling ?
bildunterschrift : groups in japan have campaigned for their " seafood culture " however , they also maintain the ban on international whale hunting is no longer necessary .
" the experts , including those abroad , agree that the species we are hunting are not under threat , " said oeystein stoerkersen - the head of norway 's directorate for nature management .
" but certain decision-makers in the united states , britain , germany and france are trying to scrounge votes by pandering to ill-informed public opinion . "
those in favor of whaling want to set up a " safe haven " for whales in the south atlantic , whilst relaxing the laws for much of the rest of the world .
however , environmentalists have dismissed these ideas as farcical , saying the point of the moratorium was to make every ocean a safe refuge for whales .
according to the international whaling commission 's scientific committee , the north atlantic has 30,000 fin whales and 174,000 minke whales .
norway argues that these numbers are healthy enough to justify hunting around 1,000 of the mammalian sea creatures each year .
the 61st annual iwc meeting is another bid to agree on definitive rules for global whale hunting , but opinions remain completely polarized going into the event. msh / dpa / afp / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

championship leader jenson button struggled home in sixth place . vettel 's third career win was largely similar to his first two : he started from pole position , led for the majority of the race and was never seriously challenged .
he pulled clear from the start and delivered a perfectly judged drive to dominate the race at silverstone .
the 21-year-old came in ahead of red bull teammate mark webber and rubens barrichello of brawn gp . the victory was vettel 's second this season , and his first on a dry circuit .
" thank you very much guys , this is a dream coming true .
we 've von the british grand prix , " he said over the team radio after taking the checkered flag .
after all the political chicanery over the past three days , the race was a more predictable affair with a huge crowd and a paddock packed with celebrities , who were treated to a demonstration drive by vettel .
button maintains lead brawn 's jenson button , who leads the championship , started sixth , but fell to ninth after the opening lap .
he worked himself back into the points and then made up two places at his second pitstop , when he switched back to softer tires .
his brawn struggled with its obligatory stint on the harder rubber compound , with the briton unable to get enough heat into the tires .
in the end , button managed a disappointing sixth place and sees his overall advantage trimmed to 23 points over rubens barichello .
but despite the setback , button maintains his comfortable lead in the driver 's standings with 64 points from eight races , followed by barichello on 41 and with vettel a distant third , on 39 points .
felipe massa of ferrari came in fourth , ahead of german nico rosberg for williams .
button , in sixth , was followed by ferrari 's kimi raikkonen and german timo glock for toyota. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

championship leader jenson button struggled home in sixth place . vettel 's third career win was largely similar to his first two : he started from pole position , led for the majority of the race and was never seriously challenged .
he pulled clear from the start and delivered a perfectly judged drive to dominate the race at silverstone .
the 21-year-old came in ahead of red bull teammate mark webber and rubens barrichello of brawn gp . the victory was vettel 's second this season , and his first on a dry circuit .
" thank you very much guys , this is a dream coming true .
we 've von the british grand prix , " he said over the team radio after taking the checkered flag .
after all the political chicanery over the past three days , the race was a more predictable affair with a huge crowd and a paddock packed with celebrities , who were treated to a demonstration drive by vettel .
button maintains lead brawn 's jenson button , who leads the championship , started sixth , but fell to ninth after the opening lap .
he worked himself back into the points and then made up two places at his second pitstop , when he switched back to softer tires .
his brawn struggled with its obligatory stint on the harder rubber compound , with the briton unable to get enough heat into the tires .
in the end , button managed a disappointing sixth place and sees his overall advantage trimmed to 23 points over rubens barichello .
but despite the setback , button maintains his comfortable lead in the driver 's standings with 64 points from eight races , followed by barichello on 41 and with vettel a distant third , on 39 points .

europe is soon to take the lead in the hunt , over japan . starting monday , the iwc will gather on the portuguese island of madeira for five days , looking to establish concrete rules on whale hunting .
environmentalists say trade in whale meat is increasing again , despite being illegal in most of the world .
commercial whale hunting is officially permitted in iceland and norway .
japan also allows whaling for scientific purposes - the country catches roughly 1,000 of the giants of the deep each year .
however , japanese whale meat not needed in the laboratory often ends up on restaurant menus instead .
japan has said it wants to reduce the scale of its scientific whaling , in exchange for rights to commercial whale hunting near its coastline .
" that would amount to lifting the commercial whaling ban that has been in force since 1986 , " says sandra altherr of the organization pro wildlife .
the three whaling nations have been pushing for an end to the international ban on trade in whale meat .
the industry is currently outlawed under the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : greenpeace members often put their lives on the line to stop whaling vessels norway and iceland reserved their right to resume hunting in this 1986 moratorium .
since then both countries have taken up the trade again , while japan circumvented the regulation by reintroducing what it calls its " scientific whaling program . "
denmark is also hoping for a special whaling dispensation , trying to convince the eu to permit greenland to hunt 50 humpback whales over five years for domestic consumption .
critics say that denmark really wants to reintroduce commercial whaling off its own shores , even though there is already plenty of whale meat available there .
flourishing trade the three nations that have rejected the moratorium are free to trade small quantities of meat amongst themselves .
after a gap of a few decades , japan started importing whale meat in 2008 .
currently japan brings in a few tons from iceland , and under 10 tons from norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whalers in scandinavia and japan say they 're just like any other fishermen the nordic nations want to increase these amounts .
the norwegian firm lofothval has obtained export licenses for 47 tons of whale meat .
greenpeace has said this is a sign of desperation .
" that shows the despair of the whaling industry that ca n't sell its products in norway and so is trying to get rid of them abroad at any price , " says truls gulowsen , the head of greenpeace in scandinavia .
" the japanese eat less and less whale meat and their warehouses are already full of products that the local hunters ca n't get rid of . "
industry professionals see the matter very differently .
for them the japanese market is a promising , large one , which offers higher prices for whale meat .
" japan , that 's more than 120 million inhabitants , " said rune froevik of lofothval , admitting that many there were not accustomed to eating whale meat .
" but they are receptive , because a large part of their diet comes from the sea . "
also , the japanese eat the fat of the whale , which norwegians discard as a waste product .
" each catch becomes more profitable because a small minke whale contains 1.5 tons of meat and 500 kilos of blubber , " said froevik .
legalised whaling ?
bildunterschrift : groups in japan have campaigned for their " seafood culture " however , they also maintain the ban on international whale hunting is no longer necessary .
" the experts , including those abroad , agree that the species we are hunting are not under threat , " said oeystein stoerkersen - the head of norway 's directorate for nature management .
" but certain decision-makers in the united states , britain , germany and france are trying to scrounge votes by pandering to ill-informed public opinion . "
those in favor of whaling want to set up a " safe haven " for whales in the south atlantic , whilst relaxing the laws for much of the rest of the world .
however , environmentalists have dismissed these ideas as farcical , saying the point of the moratorium was to make every ocean a safe refuge for whales .
according to the international whaling commission 's scientific committee , the north atlantic has 30,000 fin whales and 174,000 minke whales .
norway argues that these numbers are healthy enough to justify hunting around 1,000 of the mammalian sea creatures each year .

those in favor of whaling want to set up a " safe haven " for whales in the south atlantic , whilst relaxing the laws for much of the rest of the world .
however , environmentalists have dismissed these ideas as farcical , saying the point of the moratorium was to make every ocean a safe refuge for whales .
according to the international whaling commission 's scientific committee , the north atlantic has 30,000 fin whales and 174,000 minke whales .
norway argues that these numbers are healthy enough to justify hunting around 1,000 of the mammalian sea creatures each year .
the 61st annual iwc meeting is another bid to agree on definitive rules for global whale hunting , but opinions remain completely polarized going into the event. msh / dpa / afp / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will accept two or three prisoners .
now , it 's up to us , internally , to carry out the necessary procedures to welcome them , " foreign minister luis amado said after a visit to lisbon by us special envoy daniel fried , the man charge with finding host countries for more than 200 detainees washington has chosen not to prosecute .
amado said that the question of the ex-prisoners ' status was currently being studied by the interior ministry .
seven countries have agreed to take inmates italy announced monday that it would accept three guantanamo inmates , while spain agreed in principle to take four , dependent on their cases being reviewed by the foreign ministry .
last week nine former detainees were transferred to chad , iraq and bermuda , while the pacific island nation of palau also agreed to take in a group of 13 chinese uighurs .
portugal was the first country to press publicly for a coordinated european union resettlement plan for guantanamo prisoners back in december and is now the seventh country to take them .
the guantanamo bay prison camp was opened under former us president george w. bush to house " enemy combatants " in the government 's war on terror after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
" gitmo " , as it became known , attracted widespread international criticism for holding prisoners indefinitely , many without charge .
us president barack obama ordered the guantanamo facility closed by january of next year and the inmates either face trial or release .
washington has since been pushing for other countries to accept inmates who have not been charged and are ready to be released. nda / afp / reuters editor : greg benzow send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the speech came just ahead of the next german islam conference in berlin . in his cairo speech , schaeuble pointed out that there was legal equality for muslims in germany .
the country 's three million muslims have " the same rights , because our state guarantees freedom of religion and is not limited to a singular world view . "
the interior minister explained it was crucial that muslims living in germany learnt the language and added that the successful integration of islam into western societies will only work if muslims accept democratic constitutions " without condition . "
" whether we like it or not , there are many people who think that islam and democracy do n't mix .
these are often people who have prejudices against islam , " schaeuble told the audience of egyptian politicians and intellectuals .
" but we must also not ignore the fact that there are some muslims who also hold this opinion , " schaeuble continued .
he warned that this minority was seeing to it “ that their opinion is heard worldwide . "
to combat anti-democratic tendencies , schaeuble also said that muslim children living in germany should receive islamic courses in german .
he supported the plan that islamic clerics in the country should also be trained at german universities .
currently most of the clerics at muslim mosques in germany have received their religious training outside of germany .
this , schaeuble stressed , could only be a temporary solution .
ahead of his speech , the german interior minister met with several representatives of the egyptian government , as well as muslim and christian clerics .
the trip to egypt comes four days ahead of the next german islam conference - which schaeuble helped initiate .

70 parlamentarians have signed a petition to outlaw them , a parisian graffiti artist is turning models into manifests - with sprayed-on veils . even though no one knows who " princess hijab " really is , visitors to paris will recognize her art immediately .
working under a cloak of darkness , armed with black spray paint and a permanent marker , the graffiti artist covers posters of sexy models with cloaks of their own : burqas .
topmodel kate moss in a veil , actor owen wilson in a hijab - and suddenly , their shining smiles seem ironic .
the phantom has struck again , on one of the city 's most frequented subway stops : the paris opera .
is it art ?
or a religious statement ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all across paris you can find the works of " princess hijab " the princess is a mystery , even for graffiti insiders .
an internet search reveals a chaotic webpage with a strange manifesto .
" visual terrorism , " " artistic jihad " and " revenge for a good cause " are some of the slogans the guerilla street artist uses .
she says she wants to " hijabize " advertising , in the same vein as the anti-consumerist adbuster movement that began in canada in 1989 .
but on her myspace site , princess hijab seems to exude girl power .
the black and white page drips with red , portraying a drawing of a young woman wearing a printed scarf and a pirate eye patch while dance music plays .
the artist claims to be a 21-year-old girl , who is " disgusted . "
" jihad is her art " but in a telephone interview , princess hijab did unveil herself a bit more .
" all of these terms - visual terrorism , jihad - they are all coded , " she said .
" of course , they have a certain weight and an emotional importance , but i try to separate them from their context .
for me , it is more of an attitude , a metaphor .
and the ' noble cause ' is to demand the right to a counterstatement from images in the public sphere . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the short-short birqa conceal more than reveal ?
" princess hijab " has been bombarding the internet and the walls of paris , veiling poster girls and boys , since 2006 .
for her its not a matter of islam , but rather of artistic self realization .
" the veil has plenty of different meanings : it can be religious or secular ; it can form your identity or alienate it , " the young artist said .
" and gives me the opportunity to fight on several fronts , to remain hidden and create an alternative personality for myself .
it sets me apart from other artists in france . "
offensive veils she herself is not muslim , she said .
and certainly not prude .
her " hijabized " women are presented with mini skirts , high heels and some even with guns - and opinion is divided over her work .
on the one hand , western critics regard princess hijab as too islamic , too propagandistic .
but muslim critics complain that her " coverage " is only show - there 's still too much skin revealed .
however , the fact that the veil has a mere decorative function does n't seem to bother fans nor critics .
" those who are interested in my work are atheists , feminists and muslims .
i think that i have touched upon an issue here that does not need justificiation , " princess hijab says .
in the end , everybody has the freedom to interpret her activities whichever way they want .
" i like the idea that things are not too neatly defined , " she said .
" princess hijab " will continue to rely on the powers of ambiguity , keeping her identity and age a secret even as she takes part in her first exhibition , “ the seen and the hidden : dis _ covering the veil , ” at the austrian cultural forum in new york -lrb- through august 29 , 2009 -rrb- .
" ' princess hijab ' is an urban allegory that i have created myself .
she 's a matrix , a metamorphosis that an ordinary mortal can only dream of .
it 's a sphere reserved for gods and superheroes . "

" we will accept two or three prisoners .
now , it 's up to us , internally , to carry out the necessary procedures to welcome them , " foreign minister luis amado said after a visit to lisbon by us special envoy daniel fried , the man charge with finding host countries for more than 200 detainees washington has chosen not to prosecute .
amado said that the question of the ex-prisoners ' status was currently being studied by the interior ministry .
seven countries have agreed to take inmates italy announced monday that it would accept three guantanamo inmates , while spain agreed in principle to take four , dependent on their cases being reviewed by the foreign ministry .
last week nine former detainees were transferred to chad , iraq and bermuda , while the pacific island nation of palau also agreed to take in a group of 13 chinese uighurs .
portugal was the first country to press publicly for a coordinated european union resettlement plan for guantanamo prisoners back in december and is now the seventh country to take them .
the guantanamo bay prison camp was opened under former us president george w. bush to house " enemy combatants " in the government 's war on terror after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
" gitmo " , as it became known , attracted widespread international criticism for holding prisoners indefinitely , many without charge .
us president barack obama ordered the guantanamo facility closed by january of next year and the inmates either face trial or release .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- politics show -pipe- assisted suicide bbc news / politics show graphics version bbc sport home politics show -pipe- archive -pipe- contact us -pipe- faqs -pipe- interviews -pipe- meet the team -pipe- 07:43 gmt , sunday , 21 june 2009 08:43 uk assisted suicide gill hargreaves assisted suicide is illegal in the united kingdom - though it 's not against the law to take your own life .
helping to aid or abet another to commit suicide is a criminal offence under the 1961 suicide act in england and wales .
scotland does not have specific legislation outlawing this - but you could be prosecuted for culpable homicide if you coerce someone to take their own life .
so where does this leave relatives who help someone go abroad to take their own life ?
this week the lords hope to debate a change to the allow which would free a relative of friend from the threat of prosecution .
lord falconer the former lord chancellor has tabled an amendment to the coroners bill to in his word clarify the law .
" has its time come - i hope so .
and , the support i 've got for putting down the amendment has been pretty significant , now whether it happens or not very much depends on whether or not the lords feels the time is right with the public to make this change .
" i think it is and i hope the lords will think so as well , but we 'll have to wait and see .
" a lot of work and a lot of water needs to flow under the bridge before then . "
polls on what people think about assisted dying are few and far between .
getting the wording right so as to be as impartial as possible with the question is fraught with problems .
after all - what one person regards as assisted dying another will see as committing suicide .
so the politics show asked the polling organisation icm simply to ask people what they thought should happen to someone who accompanies a terminally ill person abroad to take their own life .
very few people said that people should always be prosecuted if they help someone end their life abroad .
just 4 % of those surveyed .
41 % thought they should sometimes be prosecuted if the police and the legal authorities think there is a good case to do so - as is the case now and 49 % think - like charles falconer and the campaigners - that people should never be prosecuted for helping in this way .
read the full results of the icm research on assisted suicide : assisted suicide poll - icm research notes * icm research interviewed a random sample of 1,012 adults aged 18 + by telephone on 17-18 june , 2009 . * interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults . * icm is a member of the british polling council and abides by its rules .
