"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

the incident comes at a time of heightened western concern about iran 's nuclear capabilities . reuters news agency reported that the uae seized the weapons two weeks ago and notified the united nations security council sanctions committee on north korea .
the australian-ownded cargo ship is reported to have been carrying grenade launchers , detonators , and munitions falsely listed as machine parts on its shipping manifesto .
a new round of un sanctions on north korea was approved unanimously on june 12 , following a nuclear weapons test by pyongyang and subsequent missile launches .
arms seizure amid thaw in ties with north korea according to news agency afp , us experts believe north korea has earned hundreds of millions of dollars by exporting military technology until recent sanctions .
north korean ships have previously been intercepted as they headed to myanmar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bill clinton secured the release of two american journalists during a visit to pyongyang earlier in august the arms seizure comes in the midst of an apparent thawing of relations between north korea and the rest of the world .
in august , pyongyang freed two us reporters who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for " hostile acts . "
it also recently reopened its doors to south koreans to reunite with relatives on their side of the border .
and on saturday , news agencies reported that north korea had freed four south korean fishermen who had been detained for almost a month .
west worried about iran 's nuclear ambitions the news about the weapons shipment also comes at a time of heightened western concerns about iran 's nuclear capabilities .
iran has already faced three rounds of sanctions for its nuclear program , and the uae - as well as other states in the region - has long worried about its neighbor 's atomic capabilities .
german chancellor angela merkel this week threatened to extend sanctions if tehran failed to cooperate with international efforts to rein in the country 's alleged nuclear program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has threatened to widen sanctions against iran merkel said that if if the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad failed to react positively to western overtures by september , sanctions in the energy and financial sector needed to be considered .
on friday , the united nations ' nuclear agency , the iaea , issued a report stating iran had increased its number of centrifuges by about a thousand , to 8,308 .
that would allow iran to expand its uranium enrichment capabilities .
the vienna-based iaea agency said that tehran had not suspended its nuclear activities as required and was particularly alarmed by the alleged role of an unidentified foreigner who had experience with explosives .
the iaea said the tehran leadership was dodging the concrete issues and was only providing shallow answers and simple denials .
the iaea report will be the main topic at a meeting of the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany on september 2 to discuss implementing harsher un sanctions against iran .
the united states has set a september deadline for iran to pressurize the islamic state into resuming nuclear talks .
the six powers have offered a package of economic and political incentives in return for concessions on its nuclear program. svs / nrt / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , federal environment minister and social democrat the social democrats insist that conservative-led regional governments in germany 's southern states of baden-wurttemburg and bavaria look for alternative sites to gorleben in their own backyards – sites capable of storing waste such as plutonium which has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years .
conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .
granite has too many cracks , making it too dangerous .
there is only one location , which has been well investigated .
we should implement it .

the pro-nuclear lobby group deutsche atomforum recently said german firms such as siemens , oen and rwe are tapping into renewed global interest , with over 30 reactors currently under construction worldwide .

and , now it has emerged that in 1982 the experts had had doubts and said other sites should be investigated , and that they were put under pressure from the-then government to delete some legislative elements . ”
fellow greens candidate juergen trittin accuses chancellor merkel 's coalition of not keeping its word in failing to complete an impartial search beyond gorleben for an alternative site by the end of the legislative period in september . german public sceptical despite claims by nuclear advocates that atomic energy is needed in the energy mix alongside renewables – at least in the medium term to head off climate change and future oil price hikes – surveys in germany show that a majority of germans remain sceptical about the nuclear industry , in part also because of the potential that terrorists could target nuclear facilities . past shipments of reprocessed german nuclear waste from france to gorleben have drawn extensive protests watched over by large squads of police .
a new survey by the polling institute forsa show that 57 percent of germany 's residents still favour the legislated phasing out of nuclear power stations by 2021 .
that leaves a minority of 38 percent who would tolerate longer usage of nuclear power. ipj / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”

conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .

responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , federal environment minister and social democrat the social democrats insist that conservative-led regional governments in germany 's southern states of baden-wurttemburg and bavaria look for alternative sites to gorleben in their own backyards – sites capable of storing waste such as plutonium which has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years .
conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .
granite has too many cracks , making it too dangerous .
there is only one location , which has been well investigated .
we should implement it .
the taxpayers , by the way , have paid a lot of money for -lsb- gorleben -rsb- – 1.5 billion euros . ”
the pro-nuclear lobby group deutsche atomforum recently said german firms such as siemens , oen and rwe are tapping into renewed global interest , with over 30 reactors currently under construction worldwide .
greens accuse government of breaking its word joining the fray are the greens , who 've long lobbied for alternative sustainable energy sources in germany .
greens co-leader for the general election , renate kunast , says the government ran a campaign of obfuscation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate kunast says enough with the lies about gorleben “ it 's been discovered that the experts ' report was falsified , " she says . " we were always told – gorleben is suitable .
and , now it has emerged that in 1982 the experts had had doubts and said other sites should be investigated , and that they were put under pressure from the-then government to delete some legislative elements . ”
fellow greens candidate juergen trittin accuses chancellor merkel 's coalition of not keeping its word in failing to complete an impartial search beyond gorleben for an alternative site by the end of the legislative period in september . german public sceptical despite claims by nuclear advocates that atomic energy is needed in the energy mix alongside renewables – at least in the medium term to head off climate change and future oil price hikes – surveys in germany show that a majority of germans remain sceptical about the nuclear industry , in part also because of the potential that terrorists could target nuclear facilities . past shipments of reprocessed german nuclear waste from france to gorleben have drawn extensive protests watched over by large squads of police .
a new survey by the polling institute forsa show that 57 percent of germany 's residents still favour the legislated phasing out of nuclear power stations by 2021 .
that leaves a minority of 38 percent who would tolerate longer usage of nuclear power. ipj / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

solana is on the first leg of a four-day tour of the region . speaking to reporters in damascus after talks with assad , solana said progress is being made in strengthening ties between syria and the european union . the talks included bilateral relations , the peace process in the middle east and syrian-iraqi relations .
assad on sunday called for stability in neighboring iraq , days after baghdad alleged that damascus is sheltering suspects linked to a massive bombing targeting government ministries on august 19 .
the attacks killed 95 people and wounded 600 , and baghdad has demanded that syria turn over one of the masterminds .
assad spoke of " the need to reach national reconciliation in iraq in order to achieve stability and security " there , during talks with solana , according to the syrian state-run sana news agency .
bildunterschrift : iraq 's finance ministry was targeted in the bombing assad has said that stability in iraq is in damascus 's best interest , but relations between the two countries are at such a low point that turkey has stepped in to see if it can try and resolve the differences between them .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu is to visit baghdad and damascus on monday august 31 .
free trade pact to take effect solana said that the eu was setting a plan for peace and stability in the region and that " syria has an important role . "
assad said that he is in favor of a peace deal with israel based on implementation of united nations resolutions 242 and 338 .
the resolutions call for israeli withdrawal from territories it occupied during the 1967 war and include the golan heights , the west bank and east jerusalem .
solana also said that an eu-syrian association agreement will be signed sometime before the end of the year .
even though syria is a signatory to the 1995 barcelona declaration , which aims to establish a free trade area after 2010 with all non-eu mediterranean countries , without an association agreement , syria can not benefit from the declaration .
at a joint press conference with syrian foreign affairs minister al muallim , solana said that eu-syrian relations are moving in the right direction .
al muallim said that for syria , the " palestinian dossier takes precedence , " whether it is " freezing settlements , lifting the blockade on gaza or making east jerusalem jewish . "
from damascus , solana heads for israel and talks with prime minister benjamin netanyahu .

the incident comes at a time of heightened western concern about iran 's nuclear capabilities . reuters news agency reported that the uae seized the weapons two weeks ago and notified the united nations security council sanctions committee on north korea .
the australian-ownded cargo ship is reported to have been carrying grenade launchers , detonators , and munitions falsely listed as machine parts on its shipping manifesto .
a new round of un sanctions on north korea was approved unanimously on june 12 , following a nuclear weapons test by pyongyang and subsequent missile launches .
arms seizure amid thaw in ties with north korea according to news agency afp , us experts believe north korea has earned hundreds of millions of dollars by exporting military technology until recent sanctions .
north korean ships have previously been intercepted as they headed to myanmar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bill clinton secured the release of two american journalists during a visit to pyongyang earlier in august the arms seizure comes in the midst of an apparent thawing of relations between north korea and the rest of the world .

it also recently reopened its doors to south koreans to reunite with relatives on their side of the border .
and on saturday , news agencies reported that north korea had freed four south korean fishermen who had been detained for almost a month .
west worried about iran 's nuclear ambitions the news about the weapons shipment also comes at a time of heightened western concerns about iran 's nuclear capabilities .
iran has already faced three rounds of sanctions for its nuclear program , and the uae - as well as other states in the region - has long worried about its neighbor 's atomic capabilities .
german chancellor angela merkel this week threatened to extend sanctions if tehran failed to cooperate with international efforts to rein in the country 's alleged nuclear program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has threatened to widen sanctions against iran merkel said that if if the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad failed to react positively to western overtures by september , sanctions in the energy and financial sector needed to be considered .
on friday , the united nations ' nuclear agency , the iaea , issued a report stating iran had increased its number of centrifuges by about a thousand , to 8,308 .
that would allow iran to expand its uranium enrichment capabilities .
the vienna-based iaea agency said that tehran had not suspended its nuclear activities as required and was particularly alarmed by the alleged role of an unidentified foreigner who had experience with explosives .
the iaea said the tehran leadership was dodging the concrete issues and was only providing shallow answers and simple denials .
the iaea report will be the main topic at a meeting of the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany on september 2 to discuss implementing harsher un sanctions against iran .
the united states has set a september deadline for iran to pressurize the islamic state into resuming nuclear talks .

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .

a parasite carried by the mosquito is responsible for west nile virus , which can infect humans and farm animals with encephalitis , an acute inflammation of the brain that can be fatal .
the mosquito originally comes from japan , korea and china , but in recent years has spread dramatically across the united states and parts of canada .
the mosquito was first discovered in europe in 2000 in france at an old tire depot but was believed to have been eradicated when the area was sprayed with pesticides .
isolated pockets of the mosquito also exist in belgium , but have not spread .
parasite expert alexander mathis from zurich university said the insect 's larva had been found at 122 of 3,500 locations tested in switzerland and germany .
mathis said the find indicates that the species had gained a foothold in europe and was spreading. gb / ap / glp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who want a coalition with the cdu on the national level , are also hoping to pick up votes and enter state governments sunday .
tillich ahead in saxony in a mirror of national politics , saxony is currently governed by a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
the latest opinion polls show the cdu , led by incumbent premier stanislav tillich , comfortably ahead .

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .
as business sales and profits have shrunk with the global recession , the traditional benchmarks , which the banking sector has used in assessing applications , have become harder to meet .

however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .
on tuesday , the steering committee of the german business fund , “ wirtschaftsfonds deutschland ” , will meet to discuss the proposal .

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .
as business sales and profits have shrunk with the global recession , the traditional benchmarks , which the banking sector has used in assessing applications , have become harder to meet .
exporters are in particular need of help .
bildunterschrift : german exporters in particular need help to ride out rough financial seas to assist germany 's hard-hit export sector , banks will be obliged to lend money equal in value to the government loan guarantees .
however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.08.2009 german parties struggle with voter apathy in key state and municipal elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germans go to the polls this sunday ?
political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .
" if citizens get the impression that there is a lot at stake in a state election and that their vote might really count , then interest in elections tends to go up . "
fickle voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans vote in three state and one municipal election on sunday having real political alternatives to vote for can also make a difference , bernhard wessels told deutsche welle .
the senior researcher from the social science research center berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- said that international comparative analyses show those are conditions that can be applied to democratic elections in any country . also , " if elections are close , turnout is higher . "
municipal elections also suffer from low voter participation .
if there is a particular issue on hand , the turnout might be quite high , wessels pointed out , but basically , voters feel that the laws that really affect them are not made on the municipal level .
he said the national polls are regarded as " real elections , where the state of the nation is decided . "

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .
" if citizens get the impression that there is a lot at stake in a state election and that their vote might really count , then interest in elections tends to go up . "
fickle voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans vote in three state and one municipal election on sunday having real political alternatives to vote for can also make a difference , bernhard wessels told deutsche welle .
the senior researcher from the social science research center berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- said that international comparative analyses show those are conditions that can be applied to democratic elections in any country . also , " if elections are close , turnout is higher . "
municipal elections also suffer from low voter participation .
if there is a particular issue on hand , the turnout might be quite high , wessels pointed out , but basically , voters feel that the laws that really affect them are not made on the municipal level .
he said the national polls are regarded as " real elections , where the state of the nation is decided . "

the incident comes at a time of heightened western concern about iran 's nuclear capabilities . reuters news agency reported that the uae seized the weapons two weeks ago and notified the united nations security council sanctions committee on north korea .
the australian-ownded cargo ship is reported to have been carrying grenade launchers , detonators , and munitions falsely listed as machine parts on its shipping manifesto .
a new round of un sanctions on north korea was approved unanimously on june 12 , following a nuclear weapons test by pyongyang and subsequent missile launches .
arms seizure amid thaw in ties with north korea according to news agency afp , us experts believe north korea has earned hundreds of millions of dollars by exporting military technology until recent sanctions .
north korean ships have previously been intercepted as they headed to myanmar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bill clinton secured the release of two american journalists during a visit to pyongyang earlier in august the arms seizure comes in the midst of an apparent thawing of relations between north korea and the rest of the world .
in august , pyongyang freed two us reporters who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for " hostile acts . "
it also recently reopened its doors to south koreans to reunite with relatives on their side of the border .
and on saturday , news agencies reported that north korea had freed four south korean fishermen who had been detained for almost a month .
west worried about iran 's nuclear ambitions the news about the weapons shipment also comes at a time of heightened western concerns about iran 's nuclear capabilities .
iran has already faced three rounds of sanctions for its nuclear program , and the uae - as well as other states in the region - has long worried about its neighbor 's atomic capabilities .
german chancellor angela merkel this week threatened to extend sanctions if tehran failed to cooperate with international efforts to rein in the country 's alleged nuclear program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has threatened to widen sanctions against iran merkel said that if if the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad failed to react positively to western overtures by september , sanctions in the energy and financial sector needed to be considered .
on friday , the united nations ' nuclear agency , the iaea , issued a report stating iran had increased its number of centrifuges by about a thousand , to 8,308 .
that would allow iran to expand its uranium enrichment capabilities .
the vienna-based iaea agency said that tehran had not suspended its nuclear activities as required and was particularly alarmed by the alleged role of an unidentified foreigner who had experience with explosives .
the iaea said the tehran leadership was dodging the concrete issues and was only providing shallow answers and simple denials .
the iaea report will be the main topic at a meeting of the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany on september 2 to discuss implementing harsher un sanctions against iran .
the united states has set a september deadline for iran to pressurize the islamic state into resuming nuclear talks .
the six powers have offered a package of economic and political incentives in return for concessions on its nuclear program. svs / nrt / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we could get another 50,000 afghan army personnel trained over the next year , " brown told reporters on saturday .
" they 're backed up by partnering and mentoring done by the british forces , " he added .
he said he had conveyed that message to both afghan president hamid karzai and to presidential candidate abdullah abdullah .
brown dismissed allegations that british forces were suffering from poor equipment and lack of support from london .
he stressed the soldiers were equipped with modern material to protect them against the insurgents ' attacks .

brown announced that this autumn , up to 200 anti-explosives specialists would be dispatched to join british troops .
there are currently 9,000 british troops in afghanistan - mostly in helmand . 207 british soldiers have been killed since 2001 .
the high casualties have increasingly turned public opinion in britain against the mission .

german magazine der spiegel on saturday cited an internal defense ministry document , saying that shoddy equipment put german troops at a disadvantage in the face of mounting attacks from the taliban .
the magazine quoted the document as saying the troops were facing a " critical " situation with vehicles and armory not working properly .
it added that bulletproof jackets were so bulky that soldiers can not aim their guns properly . also , the machine gun mounted on the armored vehicles was in effect only there for show , since it could only fire forwards and could not react to attacks from the side or rear of the vehicle . germany has around 4,000 troops stationed mostly in the northern kunduz region of afghanistan. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

separately , a report in germany says troops in afghanistan have criticized military equipment . brown , who visited helmand province , said boosting military training for afghan troops would enable them to " take more responsibility for their own affairs . "
" i think we could get another 50,000 afghan army personnel trained over the next year , " brown told reporters on saturday .
" they 're backed up by partnering and mentoring done by the british forces , " he added .
he said he had conveyed that message to both afghan president hamid karzai and to presidential candidate abdullah abdullah .
brown dismissed allegations that british forces were suffering from poor equipment and lack of support from london .
he stressed the soldiers were equipped with modern material to protect them against the insurgents ' attacks .
the british prime minister also called for better and speedier training of afghan security forces so that fighting the taliban could increasingly be shouldered by both nato and afghan forces .
afghan mission misgivings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown is under increasing pressure over the afghanistan mission brown also thanked british troops for their efforts in fighting taliban insurgents in the run up to the presidential elections .
analysts however say that better and quicker training of afghan forces will only be possible with a fresh infusion of british troops .
brown announced that this autumn , up to 200 anti-explosives specialists would be dispatched to join british troops .
there are currently 9,000 british troops in afghanistan - mostly in helmand . 207 british soldiers have been killed since 2001 .

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .

guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .
as business sales and profits have shrunk with the global recession , the traditional benchmarks , which the banking sector has used in assessing applications , have become harder to meet .
exporters are in particular need of help .
bildunterschrift : german exporters in particular need help to ride out rough financial seas to assist germany 's hard-hit export sector , banks will be obliged to lend money equal in value to the government loan guarantees .
however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .
on tuesday , the steering committee of the german business fund , “ wirtschaftsfonds deutschland ” , will meet to discuss the proposal .
they also hope to establish a model to protect private lenders against loan default. ch / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , federal environment minister and social democrat the social democrats insist that conservative-led regional governments in germany 's southern states of baden-wurttemburg and bavaria look for alternative sites to gorleben in their own backyards – sites capable of storing waste such as plutonium which has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years .
conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .
granite has too many cracks , making it too dangerous .
there is only one location , which has been well investigated .
we should implement it .
the taxpayers , by the way , have paid a lot of money for -lsb- gorleben -rsb- – 1.5 billion euros . ”
the pro-nuclear lobby group deutsche atomforum recently said german firms such as siemens , oen and rwe are tapping into renewed global interest , with over 30 reactors currently under construction worldwide .
greens accuse government of breaking its word joining the fray are the greens , who 've long lobbied for alternative sustainable energy sources in germany .
greens co-leader for the general election , renate kunast , says the government ran a campaign of obfuscation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate kunast says enough with the lies about gorleben “ it 's been discovered that the experts ' report was falsified , " she says . " we were always told – gorleben is suitable .
and , now it has emerged that in 1982 the experts had had doubts and said other sites should be investigated , and that they were put under pressure from the-then government to delete some legislative elements . ”
fellow greens candidate juergen trittin accuses chancellor merkel 's coalition of not keeping its word in failing to complete an impartial search beyond gorleben for an alternative site by the end of the legislative period in september . german public sceptical despite claims by nuclear advocates that atomic energy is needed in the energy mix alongside renewables – at least in the medium term to head off climate change and future oil price hikes – surveys in germany show that a majority of germans remain sceptical about the nuclear industry , in part also because of the potential that terrorists could target nuclear facilities . past shipments of reprocessed german nuclear waste from france to gorleben have drawn extensive protests watched over by large squads of police .
a new survey by the polling institute forsa show that 57 percent of germany 's residents still favour the legislated phasing out of nuclear power stations by 2021 .
that leaves a minority of 38 percent who would tolerate longer usage of nuclear power. ipj / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , federal environment minister and social democrat the social democrats insist that conservative-led regional governments in germany 's southern states of baden-wurttemburg and bavaria look for alternative sites to gorleben in their own backyards – sites capable of storing waste such as plutonium which has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years .
conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .
granite has too many cracks , making it too dangerous .
there is only one location , which has been well investigated .
we should implement it .
the taxpayers , by the way , have paid a lot of money for -lsb- gorleben -rsb- – 1.5 billion euros . ”
the pro-nuclear lobby group deutsche atomforum recently said german firms such as siemens , oen and rwe are tapping into renewed global interest , with over 30 reactors currently under construction worldwide .
greens accuse government of breaking its word joining the fray are the greens , who 've long lobbied for alternative sustainable energy sources in germany .
greens co-leader for the general election , renate kunast , says the government ran a campaign of obfuscation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate kunast says enough with the lies about gorleben “ it 's been discovered that the experts ' report was falsified , " she says . " we were always told – gorleben is suitable .
and , now it has emerged that in 1982 the experts had had doubts and said other sites should be investigated , and that they were put under pressure from the-then government to delete some legislative elements . ”
fellow greens candidate juergen trittin accuses chancellor merkel 's coalition of not keeping its word in failing to complete an impartial search beyond gorleben for an alternative site by the end of the legislative period in september . german public sceptical despite claims by nuclear advocates that atomic energy is needed in the energy mix alongside renewables – at least in the medium term to head off climate change and future oil price hikes – surveys in germany show that a majority of germans remain sceptical about the nuclear industry , in part also because of the potential that terrorists could target nuclear facilities . past shipments of reprocessed german nuclear waste from france to gorleben have drawn extensive protests watched over by large squads of police .
a new survey by the polling institute forsa show that 57 percent of germany 's residents still favour the legislated phasing out of nuclear power stations by 2021 .
that leaves a minority of 38 percent who would tolerate longer usage of nuclear power. ipj / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a parasite carried by the mosquito is responsible for west nile virus , which can infect humans and farm animals with encephalitis , an acute inflammation of the brain that can be fatal .
the mosquito originally comes from japan , korea and china , but in recent years has spread dramatically across the united states and parts of canada .
the mosquito was first discovered in europe in 2000 in france at an old tire depot but was believed to have been eradicated when the area was sprayed with pesticides .
isolated pockets of the mosquito also exist in belgium , but have not spread .
parasite expert alexander mathis from zurich university said the insect 's larva had been found at 122 of 3,500 locations tested in switzerland and germany .
mathis said the find indicates that the species had gained a foothold in europe and was spreading. gb / ap / glp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

assad spoke of " the need to reach national reconciliation in iraq in order to achieve stability and security " there , during talks with solana , according to the syrian state-run sana news agency .
bildunterschrift : iraq 's finance ministry was targeted in the bombing assad has said that stability in iraq is in damascus 's best interest , but relations between the two countries are at such a low point that turkey has stepped in to see if it can try and resolve the differences between them .

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .
" if citizens get the impression that there is a lot at stake in a state election and that their vote might really count , then interest in elections tends to go up . "
fickle voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans vote in three state and one municipal election on sunday having real political alternatives to vote for can also make a difference , bernhard wessels told deutsche welle .
the senior researcher from the social science research center berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- said that international comparative analyses show those are conditions that can be applied to democratic elections in any country . also , " if elections are close , turnout is higher . "
municipal elections also suffer from low voter participation .
if there is a particular issue on hand , the turnout might be quite high , wessels pointed out , but basically , voters feel that the laws that really affect them are not made on the municipal level .
he said the national polls are regarded as " real elections , where the state of the nation is decided . "
for parliamentary elections , germany is one of the western democracies with the highest voter turnout , wessels said .
only in countries like belgium , which has a compulsory voting system , is turnout higher .
in 2005 , voter turnout in the german parliamentary election was 77,7 percent – the lowest ever , and wessels speculated that participation in this year 's national polls on september 27 might even be lower , due to " a boring election campaign , and an outcome that seems to be clear to most people , so that it is not an incentive to go out and vote . "
but the researcher remained cautious .
" the experience in the last elections was that 40 percent of voters switched their opinion in the pre-election period , " he said .
" that is a lot - from one party to the other , from voting to non-voting , or from non-voting to voting . " db / nadine wojcik editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .
" if citizens get the impression that there is a lot at stake in a state election and that their vote might really count , then interest in elections tends to go up . "
fickle voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans vote in three state and one municipal election on sunday having real political alternatives to vote for can also make a difference , bernhard wessels told deutsche welle .
the senior researcher from the social science research center berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- said that international comparative analyses show those are conditions that can be applied to democratic elections in any country . also , " if elections are close , turnout is higher . "
municipal elections also suffer from low voter participation .
if there is a particular issue on hand , the turnout might be quite high , wessels pointed out , but basically , voters feel that the laws that really affect them are not made on the municipal level .
he said the national polls are regarded as " real elections , where the state of the nation is decided . "
for parliamentary elections , germany is one of the western democracies with the highest voter turnout , wessels said .
only in countries like belgium , which has a compulsory voting system , is turnout higher .
in 2005 , voter turnout in the german parliamentary election was 77,7 percent – the lowest ever , and wessels speculated that participation in this year 's national polls on september 27 might even be lower , due to " a boring election campaign , and an outcome that seems to be clear to most people , so that it is not an incentive to go out and vote . "
but the researcher remained cautious .
" the experience in the last elections was that 40 percent of voters switched their opinion in the pre-election period , " he said .
" that is a lot - from one party to the other , from voting to non-voting , or from non-voting to voting . " db / nadine wojcik editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.08.2009 german parties face key test in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's cdu could lose power in two state elections sunday voters will decide the fate of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu in three state-level elections sunday .
the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who want a coalition with the cdu on the national level , are also hoping to pick up votes and enter state governments sunday .
tillich ahead in saxony in a mirror of national politics , saxony is currently governed by a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
the latest opinion polls show the cdu , led by incumbent premier stanislav tillich , comfortably ahead .
tillich may have the luxury of choosing his next coalition partner if the cdu wins big .
there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .
the fdp and greens are also minor forces in saxon politics , having respectively gotten only 5.9 and 5.1 percent of the vote in 2004 , just skimming over the minimum five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation .
althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .
right-wing extremism cause for concern in both saxony and thuringia , political observers are concerned that right-wing extremists might get a boost in part because of the timing of this year 's elections .
with many germans on summer vacation , low voter turnout could boost the chances of extremist parties , whose supporters are more motivated to vote .
anything possible in saarland in the state of saarland , in western germany along the french border , the outcome is unclear .
experts see any number of potential coalitions , including alliances between the spd and left party , the spd , the green party and left party , the cdu and fdp , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd , or a so-called jamaica coalition -lrb- named for the respective colors of each party -rrb- comprising the cdu , fdp and greens .
in any case , opinion polls suggest that incumbent cdu state premier , peter müller , like althaus in thuringia , may lose his absolute majority . bildunterschrift : the czar of the saar : peter müller -lrb- center -rrb- on the campaign trail with chancellor angela merkel bn / gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

solana is on the first leg of a four-day tour of the region . speaking to reporters in damascus after talks with assad , solana said progress is being made in strengthening ties between syria and the european union . the talks included bilateral relations , the peace process in the middle east and syrian-iraqi relations .
assad on sunday called for stability in neighboring iraq , days after baghdad alleged that damascus is sheltering suspects linked to a massive bombing targeting government ministries on august 19 .
the attacks killed 95 people and wounded 600 , and baghdad has demanded that syria turn over one of the masterminds .
assad spoke of " the need to reach national reconciliation in iraq in order to achieve stability and security " there , during talks with solana , according to the syrian state-run sana news agency .
bildunterschrift : iraq 's finance ministry was targeted in the bombing assad has said that stability in iraq is in damascus 's best interest , but relations between the two countries are at such a low point that turkey has stepped in to see if it can try and resolve the differences between them .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu is to visit baghdad and damascus on monday august 31 .
free trade pact to take effect solana said that the eu was setting a plan for peace and stability in the region and that " syria has an important role . "
assad said that he is in favor of a peace deal with israel based on implementation of united nations resolutions 242 and 338 .
the resolutions call for israeli withdrawal from territories it occupied during the 1967 war and include the golan heights , the west bank and east jerusalem .
solana also said that an eu-syrian association agreement will be signed sometime before the end of the year .
even though syria is a signatory to the 1995 barcelona declaration , which aims to establish a free trade area after 2010 with all non-eu mediterranean countries , without an association agreement , syria can not benefit from the declaration .
at a joint press conference with syrian foreign affairs minister al muallim , solana said that eu-syrian relations are moving in the right direction .
al muallim said that for syria , the " palestinian dossier takes precedence , " whether it is " freezing settlements , lifting the blockade on gaza or making east jerusalem jewish . "
from damascus , solana heads for israel and talks with prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
from there he goes on to ramallah to visit with palestinian prime minister salam fayyad .

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .
" if citizens get the impression that there is a lot at stake in a state election and that their vote might really count , then interest in elections tends to go up . "
fickle voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans vote in three state and one municipal election on sunday having real political alternatives to vote for can also make a difference , bernhard wessels told deutsche welle .
the senior researcher from the social science research center berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- said that international comparative analyses show those are conditions that can be applied to democratic elections in any country . also , " if elections are close , turnout is higher . "
municipal elections also suffer from low voter participation .
if there is a particular issue on hand , the turnout might be quite high , wessels pointed out , but basically , voters feel that the laws that really affect them are not made on the municipal level .
he said the national polls are regarded as " real elections , where the state of the nation is decided . "
for parliamentary elections , germany is one of the western democracies with the highest voter turnout , wessels said .
only in countries like belgium , which has a compulsory voting system , is turnout higher .
in 2005 , voter turnout in the german parliamentary election was 77,7 percent – the lowest ever , and wessels speculated that participation in this year 's national polls on september 27 might even be lower , due to " a boring election campaign , and an outcome that seems to be clear to most people , so that it is not an incentive to go out and vote . "
but the researcher remained cautious .
" the experience in the last elections was that 40 percent of voters switched their opinion in the pre-election period , " he said .
" that is a lot - from one party to the other , from voting to non-voting , or from non-voting to voting . " db / nadine wojcik editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they 're backed up by partnering and mentoring done by the british forces , " he added .

brown dismissed allegations that british forces were suffering from poor equipment and lack of support from london .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.08.2009 german parties face key test in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's cdu could lose power in two state elections sunday voters will decide the fate of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu in three state-level elections sunday .
the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who want a coalition with the cdu on the national level , are also hoping to pick up votes and enter state governments sunday .
tillich ahead in saxony in a mirror of national politics , saxony is currently governed by a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
the latest opinion polls show the cdu , led by incumbent premier stanislav tillich , comfortably ahead .
tillich may have the luxury of choosing his next coalition partner if the cdu wins big .
there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .
the fdp and greens are also minor forces in saxon politics , having respectively gotten only 5.9 and 5.1 percent of the vote in 2004 , just skimming over the minimum five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation .
althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .
right-wing extremism cause for concern in both saxony and thuringia , political observers are concerned that right-wing extremists might get a boost in part because of the timing of this year 's elections .
with many germans on summer vacation , low voter turnout could boost the chances of extremist parties , whose supporters are more motivated to vote .
anything possible in saarland in the state of saarland , in western germany along the french border , the outcome is unclear .
experts see any number of potential coalitions , including alliances between the spd and left party , the spd , the green party and left party , the cdu and fdp , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd , or a so-called jamaica coalition -lrb- named for the respective colors of each party -rrb- comprising the cdu , fdp and greens .
in any case , opinion polls suggest that incumbent cdu state premier , peter müller , like althaus in thuringia , may lose his absolute majority . bildunterschrift : the czar of the saar : peter müller -lrb- center -rrb- on the campaign trail with chancellor angela merkel bn / gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .
as business sales and profits have shrunk with the global recession , the traditional benchmarks , which the banking sector has used in assessing applications , have become harder to meet .
exporters are in particular need of help .
bildunterschrift : german exporters in particular need help to ride out rough financial seas to assist germany 's hard-hit export sector , banks will be obliged to lend money equal in value to the government loan guarantees .
however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .
on tuesday , the steering committee of the german business fund , “ wirtschaftsfonds deutschland ” , will meet to discuss the proposal .
they also hope to establish a model to protect private lenders against loan default. ch / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the incident comes at a time of heightened western concern about iran 's nuclear capabilities . reuters news agency reported that the uae seized the weapons two weeks ago and notified the united nations security council sanctions committee on north korea .
the australian-ownded cargo ship is reported to have been carrying grenade launchers , detonators , and munitions falsely listed as machine parts on its shipping manifesto .
a new round of un sanctions on north korea was approved unanimously on june 12 , following a nuclear weapons test by pyongyang and subsequent missile launches .
arms seizure amid thaw in ties with north korea according to news agency afp , us experts believe north korea has earned hundreds of millions of dollars by exporting military technology until recent sanctions .
north korean ships have previously been intercepted as they headed to myanmar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bill clinton secured the release of two american journalists during a visit to pyongyang earlier in august the arms seizure comes in the midst of an apparent thawing of relations between north korea and the rest of the world .
in august , pyongyang freed two us reporters who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for " hostile acts . "
it also recently reopened its doors to south koreans to reunite with relatives on their side of the border .
and on saturday , news agencies reported that north korea had freed four south korean fishermen who had been detained for almost a month .
west worried about iran 's nuclear ambitions the news about the weapons shipment also comes at a time of heightened western concerns about iran 's nuclear capabilities .
iran has already faced three rounds of sanctions for its nuclear program , and the uae - as well as other states in the region - has long worried about its neighbor 's atomic capabilities .
german chancellor angela merkel this week threatened to extend sanctions if tehran failed to cooperate with international efforts to rein in the country 's alleged nuclear program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has threatened to widen sanctions against iran merkel said that if if the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad failed to react positively to western overtures by september , sanctions in the energy and financial sector needed to be considered .
on friday , the united nations ' nuclear agency , the iaea , issued a report stating iran had increased its number of centrifuges by about a thousand , to 8,308 .
that would allow iran to expand its uranium enrichment capabilities .
the vienna-based iaea agency said that tehran had not suspended its nuclear activities as required and was particularly alarmed by the alleged role of an unidentified foreigner who had experience with explosives .
the iaea said the tehran leadership was dodging the concrete issues and was only providing shallow answers and simple denials .
the iaea report will be the main topic at a meeting of the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany on september 2 to discuss implementing harsher un sanctions against iran .
the united states has set a september deadline for iran to pressurize the islamic state into resuming nuclear talks .

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .
" if citizens get the impression that there is a lot at stake in a state election and that their vote might really count , then interest in elections tends to go up . "
fickle voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans vote in three state and one municipal election on sunday having real political alternatives to vote for can also make a difference , bernhard wessels told deutsche welle .
the senior researcher from the social science research center berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- said that international comparative analyses show those are conditions that can be applied to democratic elections in any country . also , " if elections are close , turnout is higher . "
municipal elections also suffer from low voter participation .
if there is a particular issue on hand , the turnout might be quite high , wessels pointed out , but basically , voters feel that the laws that really affect them are not made on the municipal level .
he said the national polls are regarded as " real elections , where the state of the nation is decided . "
for parliamentary elections , germany is one of the western democracies with the highest voter turnout , wessels said .
only in countries like belgium , which has a compulsory voting system , is turnout higher .
in 2005 , voter turnout in the german parliamentary election was 77,7 percent – the lowest ever , and wessels speculated that participation in this year 's national polls on september 27 might even be lower , due to " a boring election campaign , and an outcome that seems to be clear to most people , so that it is not an incentive to go out and vote . "
but the researcher remained cautious .
" the experience in the last elections was that 40 percent of voters switched their opinion in the pre-election period , " he said .

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .

separately , a report in germany says troops in afghanistan have criticized military equipment . brown , who visited helmand province , said boosting military training for afghan troops would enable them to " take more responsibility for their own affairs . "
" i think we could get another 50,000 afghan army personnel trained over the next year , " brown told reporters on saturday .
" they 're backed up by partnering and mentoring done by the british forces , " he added .
he said he had conveyed that message to both afghan president hamid karzai and to presidential candidate abdullah abdullah .
brown dismissed allegations that british forces were suffering from poor equipment and lack of support from london .
he stressed the soldiers were equipped with modern material to protect them against the insurgents ' attacks .
the british prime minister also called for better and speedier training of afghan security forces so that fighting the taliban could increasingly be shouldered by both nato and afghan forces .
afghan mission misgivings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown is under increasing pressure over the afghanistan mission brown also thanked british troops for their efforts in fighting taliban insurgents in the run up to the presidential elections .
analysts however say that better and quicker training of afghan forces will only be possible with a fresh infusion of british troops .
brown announced that this autumn , up to 200 anti-explosives specialists would be dispatched to join british troops .
there are currently 9,000 british troops in afghanistan - mostly in helmand . 207 british soldiers have been killed since 2001 .
the high casualties have increasingly turned public opinion in britain against the mission .
german troops suffer from poor equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops say poor equipment puts them at risk brown 's visit to helmand comes amid reports in germany that german troops are suffering from poor equipment in their struggle against insurgents in the north of afghanistan .
german magazine der spiegel on saturday cited an internal defense ministry document , saying that shoddy equipment put german troops at a disadvantage in the face of mounting attacks from the taliban .
the magazine quoted the document as saying the troops were facing a " critical " situation with vehicles and armory not working properly .
it added that bulletproof jackets were so bulky that soldiers can not aim their guns properly . also , the machine gun mounted on the armored vehicles was in effect only there for show , since it could only fire forwards and could not react to attacks from the side or rear of the vehicle . germany has around 4,000 troops stationed mostly in the northern kunduz region of afghanistan. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 30.08.2009 drug and alcohol rehab meets design and creativity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this design store 's name is a funky blend of " garage " and " garbage " in a design store on vienna 's schleifmuhlgasse in the trendy sixth district , discarded material and people struggling with addiction come together to build new designs – and lives . gabriele gottwald-nathaniel sits at the huge table that serves as her desk in a room just off the airy , sun-filled shop called gabarage on vienna 's hip schleifmuhlgasse .
the store name is a blend of the words " garage " and " garbage " – a funky reflection of what gabarage does .
under gottwald-nathaniel 's direction , the staff takes left-over or used materials and in its garage-like workshop on in the viennese sixth district , transforms them into imaginative new designs .
at gabarage , old traffic signs become chairs and tables .
used footballs are transformed into vases .
puzzle pieces or small mechanical parts form one-of-a-kind earrings and necklaces .
objects and furniture that have won prestigious design awards in austria .
gottwald-nathaniel has a special name for what the store does : upcycling .
" we have more than before .
this is the meaning of upcycling , " explains gottwald-nathaniel .
" we design it up . "
beautiful things should be accessible to everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele gottwald-nathaniel says they 're " upcycling " the objects but gottwald-nathaniel is n't just the founder and manager of gabarage : she 's also a social worker .
seven years ago , she convinced europe 's biggest drug and alcohol rehab organization , the anton proksch institute , to back her on setting up gabarage as a way to help reintegrate former addicts into the mainstream labor market .
what inspired her , she says , was her conviction that beautiful things should be accessible to everyone – from drug addicts to students to the wealthy .
she also believes that one of the causes of addiction is suppressed or stunted creativity and that if addicts were given the tools and space to tap into their creativity , recovery would be more successful .
" it is a necessary gift for ourselves to live our lives creatively , " she says .
" and if addicts were given the chance to be learn to be creative , i thought they could also learn to live in a different way . "
indeed , the success rate has been high .
each year , 20 new interns start work at gabarage , receiving a minimum-wage salary paid by the austrian state of 20,000 euros .
most stay a maximum of 12 months .
when they leave , 80 percent enter and remain within the mainstream labor market , working in everything from administration to road construction .
gunter , a 38-year-old former baker has been working at gabarage since 2002 .
when he first joined the staff , he 'd just gotten clean from addiction to everything from alcohol to heroin .
he now oversees production , helping new interns turn canvas billboards into groovy shoulder bags .
" i feel accepted , respected as a human being , " he says , standing beside a row of buzzing sewing machines .
" if you make a mistake , you wo n't lose your job .
that 's not the case with other places .
but being here gives me the space to grow . "
learning from mistakes also key to garbarage 's success is co-operation from some of the country 's top businesses such as knauf and siemens , who have donated used or extra materials and objects they would otherwise have to discard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shop 's objects and furniture have won prestigious design awards the growth of gabarage has n't been all innovative bliss , however . at first , interns brainstormed for design ideas with the help of local designers , then they sought out the material among various companies with which to realize their designs .
when that did n't work – it proved too difficult to find the needed specific material from discarded objects – they flipped the process .
they asked the companies for whatever leftovers they had , then they figured out what they could make out of it . they now take orders directly from corporations of 20 up to 4,000 items for product promotion or freebies .
gabarage 's designs at first also proved to be too high-concept and high priced , which kept potential customers away .
so they widened the price range – rings made out of old coins , for instance , sell for about 30 euros – and introduced more items that would appeal to younger people .
sales shot up .
the store 's new goals are to add an on-line shop , provide more places to help people create new lives , and most importantly , to go completely independent from any outside funding , says gottwald-nathaniel .
currently , the anton proksch institute and government cover most of the 1 million euro expenses , with sales making up for a 200,000-euro gap .
gottwald-nathaniel insists being financially independent is feasible , now that people have seen how addicts can – quite literally – design a new vision of their lives .

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .
as business sales and profits have shrunk with the global recession , the traditional benchmarks , which the banking sector has used in assessing applications , have become harder to meet .
exporters are in particular need of help .
bildunterschrift : german exporters in particular need help to ride out rough financial seas to assist germany 's hard-hit export sector , banks will be obliged to lend money equal in value to the government loan guarantees .
however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .
on tuesday , the steering committee of the german business fund , “ wirtschaftsfonds deutschland ” , will meet to discuss the proposal .
they also hope to establish a model to protect private lenders against loan default. ch / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .
as business sales and profits have shrunk with the global recession , the traditional benchmarks , which the banking sector has used in assessing applications , have become harder to meet .
exporters are in particular need of help .
bildunterschrift : german exporters in particular need help to ride out rough financial seas to assist germany 's hard-hit export sector , banks will be obliged to lend money equal in value to the government loan guarantees .
however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .
on tuesday , the steering committee of the german business fund , “ wirtschaftsfonds deutschland ” , will meet to discuss the proposal .
they also hope to establish a model to protect private lenders against loan default. ch / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a parasite carried by the mosquito is responsible for west nile virus , which can infect humans and farm animals with encephalitis , an acute inflammation of the brain that can be fatal .
the mosquito originally comes from japan , korea and china , but in recent years has spread dramatically across the united states and parts of canada .
the mosquito was first discovered in europe in 2000 in france at an old tire depot but was believed to have been eradicated when the area was sprayed with pesticides .
isolated pockets of the mosquito also exist in belgium , but have not spread .

separately , a report in germany says troops in afghanistan have criticized military equipment . brown , who visited helmand province , said boosting military training for afghan troops would enable them to " take more responsibility for their own affairs . "
" i think we could get another 50,000 afghan army personnel trained over the next year , " brown told reporters on saturday .
" they 're backed up by partnering and mentoring done by the british forces , " he added .
he said he had conveyed that message to both afghan president hamid karzai and to presidential candidate abdullah abdullah .
brown dismissed allegations that british forces were suffering from poor equipment and lack of support from london .
he stressed the soldiers were equipped with modern material to protect them against the insurgents ' attacks .
the british prime minister also called for better and speedier training of afghan security forces so that fighting the taliban could increasingly be shouldered by both nato and afghan forces .
afghan mission misgivings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown is under increasing pressure over the afghanistan mission brown also thanked british troops for their efforts in fighting taliban insurgents in the run up to the presidential elections .
analysts however say that better and quicker training of afghan forces will only be possible with a fresh infusion of british troops .
brown announced that this autumn , up to 200 anti-explosives specialists would be dispatched to join british troops .
there are currently 9,000 british troops in afghanistan - mostly in helmand . 207 british soldiers have been killed since 2001 .
the high casualties have increasingly turned public opinion in britain against the mission .
german troops suffer from poor equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops say poor equipment puts them at risk brown 's visit to helmand comes amid reports in germany that german troops are suffering from poor equipment in their struggle against insurgents in the north of afghanistan .
german magazine der spiegel on saturday cited an internal defense ministry document , saying that shoddy equipment put german troops at a disadvantage in the face of mounting attacks from the taliban .
the magazine quoted the document as saying the troops were facing a " critical " situation with vehicles and armory not working properly .
it added that bulletproof jackets were so bulky that soldiers can not aim their guns properly . also , the machine gun mounted on the armored vehicles was in effect only there for show , since it could only fire forwards and could not react to attacks from the side or rear of the vehicle . germany has around 4,000 troops stationed mostly in the northern kunduz region of afghanistan. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .
as business sales and profits have shrunk with the global recession , the traditional benchmarks , which the banking sector has used in assessing applications , have become harder to meet .
exporters are in particular need of help .
bildunterschrift : german exporters in particular need help to ride out rough financial seas to assist germany 's hard-hit export sector , banks will be obliged to lend money equal in value to the government loan guarantees .
however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .
on tuesday , the steering committee of the german business fund , “ wirtschaftsfonds deutschland ” , will meet to discuss the proposal .
they also hope to establish a model to protect private lenders against loan default. ch / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .
" if citizens get the impression that there is a lot at stake in a state election and that their vote might really count , then interest in elections tends to go up . "
fickle voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans vote in three state and one municipal election on sunday having real political alternatives to vote for can also make a difference , bernhard wessels told deutsche welle .
the senior researcher from the social science research center berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- said that international comparative analyses show those are conditions that can be applied to democratic elections in any country . also , " if elections are close , turnout is higher . "
municipal elections also suffer from low voter participation .
if there is a particular issue on hand , the turnout might be quite high , wessels pointed out , but basically , voters feel that the laws that really affect them are not made on the municipal level .
he said the national polls are regarded as " real elections , where the state of the nation is decided . "
for parliamentary elections , germany is one of the western democracies with the highest voter turnout , wessels said .
only in countries like belgium , which has a compulsory voting system , is turnout higher .
in 2005 , voter turnout in the german parliamentary election was 77,7 percent – the lowest ever , and wessels speculated that participation in this year 's national polls on september 27 might even be lower , due to " a boring election campaign , and an outcome that seems to be clear to most people , so that it is not an incentive to go out and vote . "
but the researcher remained cautious .
" the experience in the last elections was that 40 percent of voters switched their opinion in the pre-election period , " he said .

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .
" if citizens get the impression that there is a lot at stake in a state election and that their vote might really count , then interest in elections tends to go up . "
fickle voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans vote in three state and one municipal election on sunday having real political alternatives to vote for can also make a difference , bernhard wessels told deutsche welle .
the senior researcher from the social science research center berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- said that international comparative analyses show those are conditions that can be applied to democratic elections in any country . also , " if elections are close , turnout is higher . "
municipal elections also suffer from low voter participation .
if there is a particular issue on hand , the turnout might be quite high , wessels pointed out , but basically , voters feel that the laws that really affect them are not made on the municipal level .
he said the national polls are regarded as " real elections , where the state of the nation is decided . "
for parliamentary elections , germany is one of the western democracies with the highest voter turnout , wessels said .
only in countries like belgium , which has a compulsory voting system , is turnout higher .
in 2005 , voter turnout in the german parliamentary election was 77,7 percent – the lowest ever , and wessels speculated that participation in this year 's national polls on september 27 might even be lower , due to " a boring election campaign , and an outcome that seems to be clear to most people , so that it is not an incentive to go out and vote . "
but the researcher remained cautious .
" the experience in the last elections was that 40 percent of voters switched their opinion in the pre-election period , " he said .
" that is a lot - from one party to the other , from voting to non-voting , or from non-voting to voting . " db / nadine wojcik editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .

guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .

separately , a report in germany says troops in afghanistan have criticized military equipment . brown , who visited helmand province , said boosting military training for afghan troops would enable them to " take more responsibility for their own affairs . "
" i think we could get another 50,000 afghan army personnel trained over the next year , " brown told reporters on saturday .
" they 're backed up by partnering and mentoring done by the british forces , " he added .
he said he had conveyed that message to both afghan president hamid karzai and to presidential candidate abdullah abdullah .
brown dismissed allegations that british forces were suffering from poor equipment and lack of support from london .
he stressed the soldiers were equipped with modern material to protect them against the insurgents ' attacks .
the british prime minister also called for better and speedier training of afghan security forces so that fighting the taliban could increasingly be shouldered by both nato and afghan forces .
afghan mission misgivings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown is under increasing pressure over the afghanistan mission brown also thanked british troops for their efforts in fighting taliban insurgents in the run up to the presidential elections .
analysts however say that better and quicker training of afghan forces will only be possible with a fresh infusion of british troops .
brown announced that this autumn , up to 200 anti-explosives specialists would be dispatched to join british troops .
there are currently 9,000 british troops in afghanistan - mostly in helmand . 207 british soldiers have been killed since 2001 .
the high casualties have increasingly turned public opinion in britain against the mission .
german troops suffer from poor equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops say poor equipment puts them at risk brown 's visit to helmand comes amid reports in germany that german troops are suffering from poor equipment in their struggle against insurgents in the north of afghanistan .
german magazine der spiegel on saturday cited an internal defense ministry document , saying that shoddy equipment put german troops at a disadvantage in the face of mounting attacks from the taliban .
the magazine quoted the document as saying the troops were facing a " critical " situation with vehicles and armory not working properly .

separately , a report in germany says troops in afghanistan have criticized military equipment . brown , who visited helmand province , said boosting military training for afghan troops would enable them to " take more responsibility for their own affairs . "
" i think we could get another 50,000 afghan army personnel trained over the next year , " brown told reporters on saturday .
" they 're backed up by partnering and mentoring done by the british forces , " he added .
he said he had conveyed that message to both afghan president hamid karzai and to presidential candidate abdullah abdullah .
brown dismissed allegations that british forces were suffering from poor equipment and lack of support from london .
he stressed the soldiers were equipped with modern material to protect them against the insurgents ' attacks .
the british prime minister also called for better and speedier training of afghan security forces so that fighting the taliban could increasingly be shouldered by both nato and afghan forces .
afghan mission misgivings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown is under increasing pressure over the afghanistan mission brown also thanked british troops for their efforts in fighting taliban insurgents in the run up to the presidential elections .
analysts however say that better and quicker training of afghan forces will only be possible with a fresh infusion of british troops .
brown announced that this autumn , up to 200 anti-explosives specialists would be dispatched to join british troops .
there are currently 9,000 british troops in afghanistan - mostly in helmand . 207 british soldiers have been killed since 2001 .
the high casualties have increasingly turned public opinion in britain against the mission .
german troops suffer from poor equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops say poor equipment puts them at risk brown 's visit to helmand comes amid reports in germany that german troops are suffering from poor equipment in their struggle against insurgents in the north of afghanistan .
german magazine der spiegel on saturday cited an internal defense ministry document , saying that shoddy equipment put german troops at a disadvantage in the face of mounting attacks from the taliban .
the magazine quoted the document as saying the troops were facing a " critical " situation with vehicles and armory not working properly .
it added that bulletproof jackets were so bulky that soldiers can not aim their guns properly . also , the machine gun mounted on the armored vehicles was in effect only there for show , since it could only fire forwards and could not react to attacks from the side or rear of the vehicle . germany has around 4,000 troops stationed mostly in the northern kunduz region of afghanistan. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they 're backed up by partnering and mentoring done by the british forces , " he added .
he said he had conveyed that message to both afghan president hamid karzai and to presidential candidate abdullah abdullah .
brown dismissed allegations that british forces were suffering from poor equipment and lack of support from london .

a parasite carried by the mosquito is responsible for west nile virus , which can infect humans and farm animals with encephalitis , an acute inflammation of the brain that can be fatal .
the mosquito originally comes from japan , korea and china , but in recent years has spread dramatically across the united states and parts of canada .
the mosquito was first discovered in europe in 2000 in france at an old tire depot but was believed to have been eradicated when the area was sprayed with pesticides .
isolated pockets of the mosquito also exist in belgium , but have not spread .
parasite expert alexander mathis from zurich university said the insect 's larva had been found at 122 of 3,500 locations tested in switzerland and germany .

the mosquito was first discovered in europe in 2000 in france at an old tire depot but was believed to have been eradicated when the area was sprayed with pesticides .
isolated pockets of the mosquito also exist in belgium , but have not spread .
parasite expert alexander mathis from zurich university said the insect 's larva had been found at 122 of 3,500 locations tested in switzerland and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.08.2009 german parties face key test in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's cdu could lose power in two state elections sunday voters will decide the fate of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu in three state-level elections sunday .
the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who want a coalition with the cdu on the national level , are also hoping to pick up votes and enter state governments sunday .
tillich ahead in saxony in a mirror of national politics , saxony is currently governed by a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
the latest opinion polls show the cdu , led by incumbent premier stanislav tillich , comfortably ahead .
tillich may have the luxury of choosing his next coalition partner if the cdu wins big .
there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .
the fdp and greens are also minor forces in saxon politics , having respectively gotten only 5.9 and 5.1 percent of the vote in 2004 , just skimming over the minimum five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation .
althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .
right-wing extremism cause for concern in both saxony and thuringia , political observers are concerned that right-wing extremists might get a boost in part because of the timing of this year 's elections .
with many germans on summer vacation , low voter turnout could boost the chances of extremist parties , whose supporters are more motivated to vote .
anything possible in saarland in the state of saarland , in western germany along the french border , the outcome is unclear .
experts see any number of potential coalitions , including alliances between the spd and left party , the spd , the green party and left party , the cdu and fdp , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd , or a so-called jamaica coalition -lrb- named for the respective colors of each party -rrb- comprising the cdu , fdp and greens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.08.2009 german parties face key test in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's cdu could lose power in two state elections sunday voters will decide the fate of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu in three state-level elections sunday .
the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who want a coalition with the cdu on the national level , are also hoping to pick up votes and enter state governments sunday .
tillich ahead in saxony in a mirror of national politics , saxony is currently governed by a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
the latest opinion polls show the cdu , led by incumbent premier stanislav tillich , comfortably ahead .
tillich may have the luxury of choosing his next coalition partner if the cdu wins big .
there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .
the fdp and greens are also minor forces in saxon politics , having respectively gotten only 5.9 and 5.1 percent of the vote in 2004 , just skimming over the minimum five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation .
althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .

on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .

" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .

bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .

his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .

on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .

bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 30.08.2009 berlin wall blog entry costs vietnamese his job großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duc referred to the berlin wall as a " wall of shame " the dismissal of popular vietnamese blogger huy duc , who praised the fall of the berlin wall in a recent post , has again highlighted the country 's restrictions on media freedom . duc was fired by his newspaper , saigon tiep thi , after the ruling communist party complained to editors about comments he 'd made in a personal blog , which he authors under the pen name " osin . "
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .
as business sales and profits have shrunk with the global recession , the traditional benchmarks , which the banking sector has used in assessing applications , have become harder to meet .

bildunterschrift : german exporters in particular need help to ride out rough financial seas to assist germany 's hard-hit export sector , banks will be obliged to lend money equal in value to the government loan guarantees .
however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .

the store name is a blend of the words " garage " and " garbage " – a funky reflection of what gabarage does .
under gottwald-nathaniel 's direction , the staff takes left-over or used materials and in its garage-like workshop on in the viennese sixth district , transforms them into imaginative new designs .
at gabarage , old traffic signs become chairs and tables .
used footballs are transformed into vases .
puzzle pieces or small mechanical parts form one-of-a-kind earrings and necklaces .
objects and furniture that have won prestigious design awards in austria .
gottwald-nathaniel has a special name for what the store does : upcycling .
" we have more than before .
this is the meaning of upcycling , " explains gottwald-nathaniel .
" we design it up . "
beautiful things should be accessible to everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele gottwald-nathaniel says they 're " upcycling " the objects but gottwald-nathaniel is n't just the founder and manager of gabarage : she 's also a social worker .
seven years ago , she convinced europe 's biggest drug and alcohol rehab organization , the anton proksch institute , to back her on setting up gabarage as a way to help reintegrate former addicts into the mainstream labor market .
what inspired her , she says , was her conviction that beautiful things should be accessible to everyone – from drug addicts to students to the wealthy .
she also believes that one of the causes of addiction is suppressed or stunted creativity and that if addicts were given the tools and space to tap into their creativity , recovery would be more successful .
" it is a necessary gift for ourselves to live our lives creatively , " she says .
" and if addicts were given the chance to be learn to be creative , i thought they could also learn to live in a different way . "
indeed , the success rate has been high .
each year , 20 new interns start work at gabarage , receiving a minimum-wage salary paid by the austrian state of 20,000 euros .
most stay a maximum of 12 months .
when they leave , 80 percent enter and remain within the mainstream labor market , working in everything from administration to road construction .
gunter , a 38-year-old former baker has been working at gabarage since 2002 .
when he first joined the staff , he 'd just gotten clean from addiction to everything from alcohol to heroin .
he now oversees production , helping new interns turn canvas billboards into groovy shoulder bags .
" i feel accepted , respected as a human being , " he says , standing beside a row of buzzing sewing machines .
" if you make a mistake , you wo n't lose your job .
that 's not the case with other places .
but being here gives me the space to grow . "
learning from mistakes also key to garbarage 's success is co-operation from some of the country 's top businesses such as knauf and siemens , who have donated used or extra materials and objects they would otherwise have to discard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shop 's objects and furniture have won prestigious design awards the growth of gabarage has n't been all innovative bliss , however . at first , interns brainstormed for design ideas with the help of local designers , then they sought out the material among various companies with which to realize their designs .
when that did n't work – it proved too difficult to find the needed specific material from discarded objects – they flipped the process .
they asked the companies for whatever leftovers they had , then they figured out what they could make out of it . they now take orders directly from corporations of 20 up to 4,000 items for product promotion or freebies .
gabarage 's designs at first also proved to be too high-concept and high priced , which kept potential customers away .
so they widened the price range – rings made out of old coins , for instance , sell for about 30 euros – and introduced more items that would appeal to younger people .
sales shot up .
the store 's new goals are to add an on-line shop , provide more places to help people create new lives , and most importantly , to go completely independent from any outside funding , says gottwald-nathaniel .
currently , the anton proksch institute and government cover most of the 1 million euro expenses , with sales making up for a 200,000-euro gap .
gottwald-nathaniel insists being financially independent is feasible , now that people have seen how addicts can – quite literally – design a new vision of their lives .

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

a parasite carried by the mosquito is responsible for west nile virus , which can infect humans and farm animals with encephalitis , an acute inflammation of the brain that can be fatal .
the mosquito originally comes from japan , korea and china , but in recent years has spread dramatically across the united states and parts of canada .
the mosquito was first discovered in europe in 2000 in france at an old tire depot but was believed to have been eradicated when the area was sprayed with pesticides .
isolated pockets of the mosquito also exist in belgium , but have not spread .
parasite expert alexander mathis from zurich university said the insect 's larva had been found at 122 of 3,500 locations tested in switzerland and germany .
mathis said the find indicates that the species had gained a foothold in europe and was spreading. gb / ap / glp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 . in thuringia in the former east germany , the party drew over 26 percent of the vote .
the party 's top candidate bodo ramelow could potentially become the state 's next premier depending on coalition negotiations .
ramelow would become the party 's first-ever premier in its current incarnation . the party has already been in a coalition with the center-left social democratic party in the state of berlin since 2001 . " this is an important day in the history of the left , " said the party 's parliamentary leader , gregor gysi .
party leader dietmar bartsch went even further . " today , we 're one of the three biggest -lsb- parties -rsb- , " bartsch said . the face of modern socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow could become the left party 's first premier in thuringia sunday night 's performance may show that the party 's socialist message resonates well with voters at a time when germany is yet to emerge from its worst recession since world war ii and unemployment continues to rise . the left party 's platform takes inspiration from communist icons such as karl marx and rosa luxembourg ; and demands stricter regulation of business and the financial sector , along with guaranteed minimum wages and maximum working hours for laborers . campaign posters for the party in berlin demand " tax the rich . "
indeed , the party wants to raise the top income tax rate to 53 percent on those earning more than 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 93,000 -rrb- a year . on foreign policy , the party regularly calls for an end to the german military 's participation in the nato-led stabilization mission in afghanistan and the dissolution of nato . party 's past makes cooperation difficult despite the left 's gains , the party is still seen as toxic by potential allies and foes alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentary leader gregor gysi transformed the party from its communist roots its predecessor , the socialist unity party , ruled east germany uninterruptedly from the country 's founding in 1949 until 1990 , when it was voted out of office in east germany 's only free and fair election . after changing its name to the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , it continued to hold seats in state parliaments across the former east germany once the two germanies reunited in 1990 but drew almost no voters in the west . the party reinvented itself in 2007 , when it merged with a small western german leftist party , the wasg , to form the left party .
the merger with the wasg brought former spd leader and saarland premier oskar lafontaine in as party leader . lafontaine stormed out of the spd in 2005 and since then has sought to bring other disaffected former spd members into the left party .
though the two parties have not ruled out governing together in a state-level coalition , on sunday night spd leaders were quick to disavow any cooperation with the left party ahead of national elections next month . " on the federal level it 's very clear , there will not be cooperation with the left , " said spd head franz muentering after preliminary election results were announced . a threat to the spd the spd will have to tread lightly in any cooperation it offers with the left party .
rivals from the market-oriented free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have sniped that the left party is not fit to govern due to its communist past . last year , a botched attempt by the spd in hesse to rely on the informal support of the left party to topple a cdu government failed after spd leaders there had initially ruled out any cooperation with the left . immediately after preliminary election results became available sunday evening , fdp head guido westerwelle said the possible left-leaning coalitions that include the sdp and left party in thuringia and saarland were a " warning shot " for germany . " those who do n't want socialists and communists to again have a say , must go to the federal elections and choose the middle-class by voting for a strong fdp , " westerwelle said in a statement . the cdu sunday night promised not to run a so-called ' red sock ' campaign against the spd for its cooperation with the left .
the cdu has relied on such campaigns in the past against the left 's predecessors to make political inroads in eastern germany . author : brett neely / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , federal environment minister and social democrat the social democrats insist that conservative-led regional governments in germany 's southern states of baden-wurttemburg and bavaria look for alternative sites to gorleben in their own backyards – sites capable of storing waste such as plutonium which has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years .
conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .
granite has too many cracks , making it too dangerous .
there is only one location , which has been well investigated .
we should implement it .
the taxpayers , by the way , have paid a lot of money for -lsb- gorleben -rsb- – 1.5 billion euros . ”
the pro-nuclear lobby group deutsche atomforum recently said german firms such as siemens , oen and rwe are tapping into renewed global interest , with over 30 reactors currently under construction worldwide .
greens accuse government of breaking its word joining the fray are the greens , who 've long lobbied for alternative sustainable energy sources in germany .
greens co-leader for the general election , renate kunast , says the government ran a campaign of obfuscation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate kunast says enough with the lies about gorleben “ it 's been discovered that the experts ' report was falsified , " she says . " we were always told – gorleben is suitable .
and , now it has emerged that in 1982 the experts had had doubts and said other sites should be investigated , and that they were put under pressure from the-then government to delete some legislative elements . ”
fellow greens candidate juergen trittin accuses chancellor merkel 's coalition of not keeping its word in failing to complete an impartial search beyond gorleben for an alternative site by the end of the legislative period in september . german public sceptical despite claims by nuclear advocates that atomic energy is needed in the energy mix alongside renewables – at least in the medium term to head off climate change and future oil price hikes – surveys in germany show that a majority of germans remain sceptical about the nuclear industry , in part also because of the potential that terrorists could target nuclear facilities . past shipments of reprocessed german nuclear waste from france to gorleben have drawn extensive protests watched over by large squads of police .
a new survey by the polling institute forsa show that 57 percent of germany 's residents still favour the legislated phasing out of nuclear power stations by 2021 .
that leaves a minority of 38 percent who would tolerate longer usage of nuclear power. ipj / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.08.2009 german parties face key test in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's cdu could lose power in two state elections sunday voters will decide the fate of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu in three state-level elections sunday .
the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who want a coalition with the cdu on the national level , are also hoping to pick up votes and enter state governments sunday .
tillich ahead in saxony in a mirror of national politics , saxony is currently governed by a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
the latest opinion polls show the cdu , led by incumbent premier stanislav tillich , comfortably ahead .
tillich may have the luxury of choosing his next coalition partner if the cdu wins big .
there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .
the fdp and greens are also minor forces in saxon politics , having respectively gotten only 5.9 and 5.1 percent of the vote in 2004 , just skimming over the minimum five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation .
althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .
right-wing extremism cause for concern in both saxony and thuringia , political observers are concerned that right-wing extremists might get a boost in part because of the timing of this year 's elections .
with many germans on summer vacation , low voter turnout could boost the chances of extremist parties , whose supporters are more motivated to vote .
anything possible in saarland in the state of saarland , in western germany along the french border , the outcome is unclear .
experts see any number of potential coalitions , including alliances between the spd and left party , the spd , the green party and left party , the cdu and fdp , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd , or a so-called jamaica coalition -lrb- named for the respective colors of each party -rrb- comprising the cdu , fdp and greens .
in any case , opinion polls suggest that incumbent cdu state premier , peter müller , like althaus in thuringia , may lose his absolute majority . bildunterschrift : the czar of the saar : peter müller -lrb- center -rrb- on the campaign trail with chancellor angela merkel bn / gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .
as business sales and profits have shrunk with the global recession , the traditional benchmarks , which the banking sector has used in assessing applications , have become harder to meet .
exporters are in particular need of help .
bildunterschrift : german exporters in particular need help to ride out rough financial seas to assist germany 's hard-hit export sector , banks will be obliged to lend money equal in value to the government loan guarantees .
however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .
on tuesday , the steering committee of the german business fund , “ wirtschaftsfonds deutschland ” , will meet to discuss the proposal .
they also hope to establish a model to protect private lenders against loan default. ch / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

separately , a report in germany says troops in afghanistan have criticized military equipment . brown , who visited helmand province , said boosting military training for afghan troops would enable them to " take more responsibility for their own affairs . "
" i think we could get another 50,000 afghan army personnel trained over the next year , " brown told reporters on saturday .
" they 're backed up by partnering and mentoring done by the british forces , " he added .
he said he had conveyed that message to both afghan president hamid karzai and to presidential candidate abdullah abdullah .
brown dismissed allegations that british forces were suffering from poor equipment and lack of support from london .
he stressed the soldiers were equipped with modern material to protect them against the insurgents ' attacks .
the british prime minister also called for better and speedier training of afghan security forces so that fighting the taliban could increasingly be shouldered by both nato and afghan forces .
afghan mission misgivings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown is under increasing pressure over the afghanistan mission brown also thanked british troops for their efforts in fighting taliban insurgents in the run up to the presidential elections .
analysts however say that better and quicker training of afghan forces will only be possible with a fresh infusion of british troops .
brown announced that this autumn , up to 200 anti-explosives specialists would be dispatched to join british troops .
there are currently 9,000 british troops in afghanistan - mostly in helmand . 207 british soldiers have been killed since 2001 .
the high casualties have increasingly turned public opinion in britain against the mission .
german troops suffer from poor equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops say poor equipment puts them at risk brown 's visit to helmand comes amid reports in germany that german troops are suffering from poor equipment in their struggle against insurgents in the north of afghanistan .
german magazine der spiegel on saturday cited an internal defense ministry document , saying that shoddy equipment put german troops at a disadvantage in the face of mounting attacks from the taliban .
the magazine quoted the document as saying the troops were facing a " critical " situation with vehicles and armory not working properly .
it added that bulletproof jackets were so bulky that soldiers can not aim their guns properly . also , the machine gun mounted on the armored vehicles was in effect only there for show , since it could only fire forwards and could not react to attacks from the side or rear of the vehicle . germany has around 4,000 troops stationed mostly in the northern kunduz region of afghanistan. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the incident comes at a time of heightened western concern about iran 's nuclear capabilities . reuters news agency reported that the uae seized the weapons two weeks ago and notified the united nations security council sanctions committee on north korea .
the australian-ownded cargo ship is reported to have been carrying grenade launchers , detonators , and munitions falsely listed as machine parts on its shipping manifesto .
a new round of un sanctions on north korea was approved unanimously on june 12 , following a nuclear weapons test by pyongyang and subsequent missile launches .
arms seizure amid thaw in ties with north korea according to news agency afp , us experts believe north korea has earned hundreds of millions of dollars by exporting military technology until recent sanctions .
north korean ships have previously been intercepted as they headed to myanmar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bill clinton secured the release of two american journalists during a visit to pyongyang earlier in august the arms seizure comes in the midst of an apparent thawing of relations between north korea and the rest of the world .
in august , pyongyang freed two us reporters who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for " hostile acts . "
it also recently reopened its doors to south koreans to reunite with relatives on their side of the border .
and on saturday , news agencies reported that north korea had freed four south korean fishermen who had been detained for almost a month .
west worried about iran 's nuclear ambitions the news about the weapons shipment also comes at a time of heightened western concerns about iran 's nuclear capabilities .
iran has already faced three rounds of sanctions for its nuclear program , and the uae - as well as other states in the region - has long worried about its neighbor 's atomic capabilities .
german chancellor angela merkel this week threatened to extend sanctions if tehran failed to cooperate with international efforts to rein in the country 's alleged nuclear program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has threatened to widen sanctions against iran merkel said that if if the government of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad failed to react positively to western overtures by september , sanctions in the energy and financial sector needed to be considered .
on friday , the united nations ' nuclear agency , the iaea , issued a report stating iran had increased its number of centrifuges by about a thousand , to 8,308 .
that would allow iran to expand its uranium enrichment capabilities .
the vienna-based iaea agency said that tehran had not suspended its nuclear activities as required and was particularly alarmed by the alleged role of an unidentified foreigner who had experience with explosives .
the iaea said the tehran leadership was dodging the concrete issues and was only providing shallow answers and simple denials .
the iaea report will be the main topic at a meeting of the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany on september 2 to discuss implementing harsher un sanctions against iran .
the united states has set a september deadline for iran to pressurize the islamic state into resuming nuclear talks .
the six powers have offered a package of economic and political incentives in return for concessions on its nuclear program. svs / nrt / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a parasite carried by the mosquito is responsible for west nile virus , which can infect humans and farm animals with encephalitis , an acute inflammation of the brain that can be fatal .
the mosquito originally comes from japan , korea and china , but in recent years has spread dramatically across the united states and parts of canada .
the mosquito was first discovered in europe in 2000 in france at an old tire depot but was believed to have been eradicated when the area was sprayed with pesticides .
isolated pockets of the mosquito also exist in belgium , but have not spread .
parasite expert alexander mathis from zurich university said the insect 's larva had been found at 122 of 3,500 locations tested in switzerland and germany .
mathis said the find indicates that the species had gained a foothold in europe and was spreading. gb / ap / glp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who want a coalition with the cdu on the national level , are also hoping to pick up votes and enter state governments sunday .
tillich ahead in saxony in a mirror of national politics , saxony is currently governed by a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
the latest opinion polls show the cdu , led by incumbent premier stanislav tillich , comfortably ahead .
tillich may have the luxury of choosing his next coalition partner if the cdu wins big .
there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .
the fdp and greens are also minor forces in saxon politics , having respectively gotten only 5.9 and 5.1 percent of the vote in 2004 , just skimming over the minimum five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation .
althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .
right-wing extremism cause for concern in both saxony and thuringia , political observers are concerned that right-wing extremists might get a boost in part because of the timing of this year 's elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 30.08.2009 left party makes big inroads in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader oskar lafontaine helped lead the left to a second place finish in saarland the left party , descendants of the former ruling party of communist east germany , made big gains in sunday 's polls and is poised to enter governments in both eastern and western germany . after sunday night 's state elections , the left party stands a good chance of participating in two state governments .
the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 . in thuringia in the former east germany , the party drew over 26 percent of the vote .
the party 's top candidate bodo ramelow could potentially become the state 's next premier depending on coalition negotiations .
ramelow would become the party 's first-ever premier in its current incarnation . the party has already been in a coalition with the center-left social democratic party in the state of berlin since 2001 . " this is an important day in the history of the left , " said the party 's parliamentary leader , gregor gysi .
party leader dietmar bartsch went even further . " today , we 're one of the three biggest -lsb- parties -rsb- , " bartsch said . the face of modern socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow could become the left party 's first premier in thuringia sunday night 's performance may show that the party 's socialist message resonates well with voters at a time when germany is yet to emerge from its worst recession since world war ii and unemployment continues to rise . the left party 's platform takes inspiration from communist icons such as karl marx and rosa luxembourg ; and demands stricter regulation of business and the financial sector , along with guaranteed minimum wages and maximum working hours for laborers . campaign posters for the party in berlin demand " tax the rich . "
indeed , the party wants to raise the top income tax rate to 53 percent on those earning more than 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 93,000 -rrb- a year . on foreign policy , the party regularly calls for an end to the german military 's participation in the nato-led stabilization mission in afghanistan and the dissolution of nato . party 's past makes cooperation difficult despite the left 's gains , the party is still seen as toxic by potential allies and foes alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentary leader gregor gysi transformed the party from its communist roots its predecessor , the socialist unity party , ruled east germany uninterruptedly from the country 's founding in 1949 until 1990 , when it was voted out of office in east germany 's only free and fair election . after changing its name to the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , it continued to hold seats in state parliaments across the former east germany once the two germanies reunited in 1990 but drew almost no voters in the west . the party reinvented itself in 2007 , when it merged with a small western german leftist party , the wasg , to form the left party .
the merger with the wasg brought former spd leader and saarland premier oskar lafontaine in as party leader . lafontaine stormed out of the spd in 2005 and since then has sought to bring other disaffected former spd members into the left party .
though the two parties have not ruled out governing together in a state-level coalition , on sunday night spd leaders were quick to disavow any cooperation with the left party ahead of national elections next month . " on the federal level it 's very clear , there will not be cooperation with the left , " said spd head franz muentering after preliminary election results were announced . a threat to the spd the spd will have to tread lightly in any cooperation it offers with the left party .
rivals from the market-oriented free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have sniped that the left party is not fit to govern due to its communist past . last year , a botched attempt by the spd in hesse to rely on the informal support of the left party to topple a cdu government failed after spd leaders there had initially ruled out any cooperation with the left . immediately after preliminary election results became available sunday evening , fdp head guido westerwelle said the possible left-leaning coalitions that include the sdp and left party in thuringia and saarland were a " warning shot " for germany . " those who do n't want socialists and communists to again have a say , must go to the federal elections and choose the middle-class by voting for a strong fdp , " westerwelle said in a statement . the cdu sunday night promised not to run a so-called ' red sock ' campaign against the spd for its cooperation with the left .
the cdu has relied on such campaigns in the past against the left 's predecessors to make political inroads in eastern germany . author : brett neely / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de merkel 's cdu party experiences setback in state elections just a month before national elections , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats suffered big losses in two out of three state elections , while the left-wing left party and the liberal free democrats gained ground .

solana is on the first leg of a four-day tour of the region . speaking to reporters in damascus after talks with assad , solana said progress is being made in strengthening ties between syria and the european union . the talks included bilateral relations , the peace process in the middle east and syrian-iraqi relations .
assad on sunday called for stability in neighboring iraq , days after baghdad alleged that damascus is sheltering suspects linked to a massive bombing targeting government ministries on august 19 .
the attacks killed 95 people and wounded 600 , and baghdad has demanded that syria turn over one of the masterminds .
assad spoke of " the need to reach national reconciliation in iraq in order to achieve stability and security " there , during talks with solana , according to the syrian state-run sana news agency .
bildunterschrift : iraq 's finance ministry was targeted in the bombing assad has said that stability in iraq is in damascus 's best interest , but relations between the two countries are at such a low point that turkey has stepped in to see if it can try and resolve the differences between them .

even though syria is a signatory to the 1995 barcelona declaration , which aims to establish a free trade area after 2010 with all non-eu mediterranean countries , without an association agreement , syria can not benefit from the declaration .
at a joint press conference with syrian foreign affairs minister al muallim , solana said that eu-syrian relations are moving in the right direction .

the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 . in thuringia in the former east germany , the party drew over 26 percent of the vote .

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , federal environment minister and social democrat the social democrats insist that conservative-led regional governments in germany 's southern states of baden-wurttemburg and bavaria look for alternative sites to gorleben in their own backyards – sites capable of storing waste such as plutonium which has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years .
conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .
granite has too many cracks , making it too dangerous .
there is only one location , which has been well investigated .
we should implement it .
the taxpayers , by the way , have paid a lot of money for -lsb- gorleben -rsb- – 1.5 billion euros . ”
the pro-nuclear lobby group deutsche atomforum recently said german firms such as siemens , oen and rwe are tapping into renewed global interest , with over 30 reactors currently under construction worldwide .
greens accuse government of breaking its word joining the fray are the greens , who 've long lobbied for alternative sustainable energy sources in germany .
greens co-leader for the general election , renate kunast , says the government ran a campaign of obfuscation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate kunast says enough with the lies about gorleben “ it 's been discovered that the experts ' report was falsified , " she says . " we were always told – gorleben is suitable .
and , now it has emerged that in 1982 the experts had had doubts and said other sites should be investigated , and that they were put under pressure from the-then government to delete some legislative elements . ”
fellow greens candidate juergen trittin accuses chancellor merkel 's coalition of not keeping its word in failing to complete an impartial search beyond gorleben for an alternative site by the end of the legislative period in september . german public sceptical despite claims by nuclear advocates that atomic energy is needed in the energy mix alongside renewables – at least in the medium term to head off climate change and future oil price hikes – surveys in germany show that a majority of germans remain sceptical about the nuclear industry , in part also because of the potential that terrorists could target nuclear facilities . past shipments of reprocessed german nuclear waste from france to gorleben have drawn extensive protests watched over by large squads of police .
a new survey by the polling institute forsa show that 57 percent of germany 's residents still favour the legislated phasing out of nuclear power stations by 2021 .
that leaves a minority of 38 percent who would tolerate longer usage of nuclear power. ipj / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.08.2009 german parties face key test in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's cdu could lose power in two state elections sunday voters will decide the fate of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu in three state-level elections sunday .
the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who want a coalition with the cdu on the national level , are also hoping to pick up votes and enter state governments sunday .
tillich ahead in saxony in a mirror of national politics , saxony is currently governed by a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
the latest opinion polls show the cdu , led by incumbent premier stanislav tillich , comfortably ahead .
tillich may have the luxury of choosing his next coalition partner if the cdu wins big .
there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .
the fdp and greens are also minor forces in saxon politics , having respectively gotten only 5.9 and 5.1 percent of the vote in 2004 , just skimming over the minimum five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation .
althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .
right-wing extremism cause for concern in both saxony and thuringia , political observers are concerned that right-wing extremists might get a boost in part because of the timing of this year 's elections .
with many germans on summer vacation , low voter turnout could boost the chances of extremist parties , whose supporters are more motivated to vote .
anything possible in saarland in the state of saarland , in western germany along the french border , the outcome is unclear .
experts see any number of potential coalitions , including alliances between the spd and left party , the spd , the green party and left party , the cdu and fdp , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd , or a so-called jamaica coalition -lrb- named for the respective colors of each party -rrb- comprising the cdu , fdp and greens .
in any case , opinion polls suggest that incumbent cdu state premier , peter müller , like althaus in thuringia , may lose his absolute majority . bildunterschrift : the czar of the saar : peter müller -lrb- center -rrb- on the campaign trail with chancellor angela merkel bn / gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 30.08.2009 left party makes big inroads in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party leader oskar lafontaine helped lead the left to a second place finish in saarland the left party , descendants of the former ruling party of communist east germany , made big gains in sunday 's polls and is poised to enter governments in both eastern and western germany . after sunday night 's state elections , the left party stands a good chance of participating in two state governments .
the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 . in thuringia in the former east germany , the party drew over 26 percent of the vote .
the party 's top candidate bodo ramelow could potentially become the state 's next premier depending on coalition negotiations .
ramelow would become the party 's first-ever premier in its current incarnation . the party has already been in a coalition with the center-left social democratic party in the state of berlin since 2001 . " this is an important day in the history of the left , " said the party 's parliamentary leader , gregor gysi .
party leader dietmar bartsch went even further . " today , we 're one of the three biggest -lsb- parties -rsb- , " bartsch said . the face of modern socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow could become the left party 's first premier in thuringia sunday night 's performance may show that the party 's socialist message resonates well with voters at a time when germany is yet to emerge from its worst recession since world war ii and unemployment continues to rise . the left party 's platform takes inspiration from communist icons such as karl marx and rosa luxembourg ; and demands stricter regulation of business and the financial sector , along with guaranteed minimum wages and maximum working hours for laborers . campaign posters for the party in berlin demand " tax the rich . "
indeed , the party wants to raise the top income tax rate to 53 percent on those earning more than 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 93,000 -rrb- a year . on foreign policy , the party regularly calls for an end to the german military 's participation in the nato-led stabilization mission in afghanistan and the dissolution of nato . party 's past makes cooperation difficult despite the left 's gains , the party is still seen as toxic by potential allies and foes alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentary leader gregor gysi transformed the party from its communist roots its predecessor , the socialist unity party , ruled east germany uninterruptedly from the country 's founding in 1949 until 1990 , when it was voted out of office in east germany 's only free and fair election . after changing its name to the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , it continued to hold seats in state parliaments across the former east germany once the two germanies reunited in 1990 but drew almost no voters in the west . the party reinvented itself in 2007 , when it merged with a small western german leftist party , the wasg , to form the left party .
the merger with the wasg brought former spd leader and saarland premier oskar lafontaine in as party leader . lafontaine stormed out of the spd in 2005 and since then has sought to bring other disaffected former spd members into the left party .
though the two parties have not ruled out governing together in a state-level coalition , on sunday night spd leaders were quick to disavow any cooperation with the left party ahead of national elections next month . " on the federal level it 's very clear , there will not be cooperation with the left , " said spd head franz muentering after preliminary election results were announced . a threat to the spd the spd will have to tread lightly in any cooperation it offers with the left party .
rivals from the market-oriented free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have sniped that the left party is not fit to govern due to its communist past . last year , a botched attempt by the spd in hesse to rely on the informal support of the left party to topple a cdu government failed after spd leaders there had initially ruled out any cooperation with the left . immediately after preliminary election results became available sunday evening , fdp head guido westerwelle said the possible left-leaning coalitions that include the sdp and left party in thuringia and saarland were a " warning shot " for germany . " those who do n't want socialists and communists to again have a say , must go to the federal elections and choose the middle-class by voting for a strong fdp , " westerwelle said in a statement . the cdu sunday night promised not to run a so-called ' red sock ' campaign against the spd for its cooperation with the left .
the cdu has relied on such campaigns in the past against the left 's predecessors to make political inroads in eastern germany . author : brett neely / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .

however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .
on tuesday , the steering committee of the german business fund , “ wirtschaftsfonds deutschland ” , will meet to discuss the proposal .
they also hope to establish a model to protect private lenders against loan default. ch / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .
as business sales and profits have shrunk with the global recession , the traditional benchmarks , which the banking sector has used in assessing applications , have become harder to meet .
exporters are in particular need of help .
bildunterschrift : german exporters in particular need help to ride out rough financial seas to assist germany 's hard-hit export sector , banks will be obliged to lend money equal in value to the government loan guarantees .
however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .
on tuesday , the steering committee of the german business fund , “ wirtschaftsfonds deutschland ” , will meet to discuss the proposal .
they also hope to establish a model to protect private lenders against loan default. ch / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

solana is on the first leg of a four-day tour of the region . speaking to reporters in damascus after talks with assad , solana said progress is being made in strengthening ties between syria and the european union . the talks included bilateral relations , the peace process in the middle east and syrian-iraqi relations .
assad on sunday called for stability in neighboring iraq , days after baghdad alleged that damascus is sheltering suspects linked to a massive bombing targeting government ministries on august 19 .
the attacks killed 95 people and wounded 600 , and baghdad has demanded that syria turn over one of the masterminds .
assad spoke of " the need to reach national reconciliation in iraq in order to achieve stability and security " there , during talks with solana , according to the syrian state-run sana news agency .
bildunterschrift : iraq 's finance ministry was targeted in the bombing assad has said that stability in iraq is in damascus 's best interest , but relations between the two countries are at such a low point that turkey has stepped in to see if it can try and resolve the differences between them .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu is to visit baghdad and damascus on monday august 31 .
free trade pact to take effect solana said that the eu was setting a plan for peace and stability in the region and that " syria has an important role . "
assad said that he is in favor of a peace deal with israel based on implementation of united nations resolutions 242 and 338 .
the resolutions call for israeli withdrawal from territories it occupied during the 1967 war and include the golan heights , the west bank and east jerusalem .
solana also said that an eu-syrian association agreement will be signed sometime before the end of the year .
even though syria is a signatory to the 1995 barcelona declaration , which aims to establish a free trade area after 2010 with all non-eu mediterranean countries , without an association agreement , syria can not benefit from the declaration .
at a joint press conference with syrian foreign affairs minister al muallim , solana said that eu-syrian relations are moving in the right direction .
al muallim said that for syria , the " palestinian dossier takes precedence , " whether it is " freezing settlements , lifting the blockade on gaza or making east jerusalem jewish . "
from damascus , solana heads for israel and talks with prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
from there he goes on to ramallah to visit with palestinian prime minister salam fayyad .

the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , federal environment minister and social democrat the social democrats insist that conservative-led regional governments in germany 's southern states of baden-wurttemburg and bavaria look for alternative sites to gorleben in their own backyards – sites capable of storing waste such as plutonium which has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years .
conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .
granite has too many cracks , making it too dangerous .
there is only one location , which has been well investigated .
we should implement it .
the taxpayers , by the way , have paid a lot of money for -lsb- gorleben -rsb- – 1.5 billion euros . ”
the pro-nuclear lobby group deutsche atomforum recently said german firms such as siemens , oen and rwe are tapping into renewed global interest , with over 30 reactors currently under construction worldwide .
greens accuse government of breaking its word joining the fray are the greens , who 've long lobbied for alternative sustainable energy sources in germany .
greens co-leader for the general election , renate kunast , says the government ran a campaign of obfuscation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate kunast says enough with the lies about gorleben “ it 's been discovered that the experts ' report was falsified , " she says . " we were always told – gorleben is suitable .
and , now it has emerged that in 1982 the experts had had doubts and said other sites should be investigated , and that they were put under pressure from the-then government to delete some legislative elements . ”
fellow greens candidate juergen trittin accuses chancellor merkel 's coalition of not keeping its word in failing to complete an impartial search beyond gorleben for an alternative site by the end of the legislative period in september . german public sceptical despite claims by nuclear advocates that atomic energy is needed in the energy mix alongside renewables – at least in the medium term to head off climate change and future oil price hikes – surveys in germany show that a majority of germans remain sceptical about the nuclear industry , in part also because of the potential that terrorists could target nuclear facilities . past shipments of reprocessed german nuclear waste from france to gorleben have drawn extensive protests watched over by large squads of police .
a new survey by the polling institute forsa show that 57 percent of germany 's residents still favour the legislated phasing out of nuclear power stations by 2021 .
that leaves a minority of 38 percent who would tolerate longer usage of nuclear power. ipj / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.08.2009 german parties face key test in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's cdu could lose power in two state elections sunday voters will decide the fate of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu in three state-level elections sunday .
the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who want a coalition with the cdu on the national level , are also hoping to pick up votes and enter state governments sunday .
tillich ahead in saxony in a mirror of national politics , saxony is currently governed by a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
the latest opinion polls show the cdu , led by incumbent premier stanislav tillich , comfortably ahead .
tillich may have the luxury of choosing his next coalition partner if the cdu wins big .
there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .
the fdp and greens are also minor forces in saxon politics , having respectively gotten only 5.9 and 5.1 percent of the vote in 2004 , just skimming over the minimum five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation .
althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .
right-wing extremism cause for concern in both saxony and thuringia , political observers are concerned that right-wing extremists might get a boost in part because of the timing of this year 's elections .
with many germans on summer vacation , low voter turnout could boost the chances of extremist parties , whose supporters are more motivated to vote .
anything possible in saarland in the state of saarland , in western germany along the french border , the outcome is unclear .
experts see any number of potential coalitions , including alliances between the spd and left party , the spd , the green party and left party , the cdu and fdp , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd , or a so-called jamaica coalition -lrb- named for the respective colors of each party -rrb- comprising the cdu , fdp and greens .
in any case , opinion polls suggest that incumbent cdu state premier , peter müller , like althaus in thuringia , may lose his absolute majority . bildunterschrift : the czar of the saar : peter müller -lrb- center -rrb- on the campaign trail with chancellor angela merkel bn / gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .

tillich may have the luxury of choosing his next coalition partner if the cdu wins big .
there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .

althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .
right-wing extremism cause for concern in both saxony and thuringia , political observers are concerned that right-wing extremists might get a boost in part because of the timing of this year 's elections .

the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .

there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .
the fdp and greens are also minor forces in saxon politics , having respectively gotten only 5.9 and 5.1 percent of the vote in 2004 , just skimming over the minimum five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation .
althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .
right-wing extremism cause for concern in both saxony and thuringia , political observers are concerned that right-wing extremists might get a boost in part because of the timing of this year 's elections .

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , federal environment minister and social democrat the social democrats insist that conservative-led regional governments in germany 's southern states of baden-wurttemburg and bavaria look for alternative sites to gorleben in their own backyards – sites capable of storing waste such as plutonium which has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years .
conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .
granite has too many cracks , making it too dangerous .
there is only one location , which has been well investigated .
we should implement it .
the taxpayers , by the way , have paid a lot of money for -lsb- gorleben -rsb- – 1.5 billion euros . ”
the pro-nuclear lobby group deutsche atomforum recently said german firms such as siemens , oen and rwe are tapping into renewed global interest , with over 30 reactors currently under construction worldwide .
greens accuse government of breaking its word joining the fray are the greens , who 've long lobbied for alternative sustainable energy sources in germany .
greens co-leader for the general election , renate kunast , says the government ran a campaign of obfuscation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate kunast says enough with the lies about gorleben “ it 's been discovered that the experts ' report was falsified , " she says . " we were always told – gorleben is suitable .
and , now it has emerged that in 1982 the experts had had doubts and said other sites should be investigated , and that they were put under pressure from the-then government to delete some legislative elements . ”
fellow greens candidate juergen trittin accuses chancellor merkel 's coalition of not keeping its word in failing to complete an impartial search beyond gorleben for an alternative site by the end of the legislative period in september . german public sceptical despite claims by nuclear advocates that atomic energy is needed in the energy mix alongside renewables – at least in the medium term to head off climate change and future oil price hikes – surveys in germany show that a majority of germans remain sceptical about the nuclear industry , in part also because of the potential that terrorists could target nuclear facilities . past shipments of reprocessed german nuclear waste from france to gorleben have drawn extensive protests watched over by large squads of police .
a new survey by the polling institute forsa show that 57 percent of germany 's residents still favour the legislated phasing out of nuclear power stations by 2021 .
that leaves a minority of 38 percent who would tolerate longer usage of nuclear power. ipj / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”

conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .

the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 . in thuringia in the former east germany , the party drew over 26 percent of the vote .
the party 's top candidate bodo ramelow could potentially become the state 's next premier depending on coalition negotiations .
ramelow would become the party 's first-ever premier in its current incarnation . the party has already been in a coalition with the center-left social democratic party in the state of berlin since 2001 . " this is an important day in the history of the left , " said the party 's parliamentary leader , gregor gysi .
party leader dietmar bartsch went even further . " today , we 're one of the three biggest -lsb- parties -rsb- , " bartsch said . the face of modern socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow could become the left party 's first premier in thuringia sunday night 's performance may show that the party 's socialist message resonates well with voters at a time when germany is yet to emerge from its worst recession since world war ii and unemployment continues to rise . the left party 's platform takes inspiration from communist icons such as karl marx and rosa luxembourg ; and demands stricter regulation of business and the financial sector , along with guaranteed minimum wages and maximum working hours for laborers . campaign posters for the party in berlin demand " tax the rich . "
indeed , the party wants to raise the top income tax rate to 53 percent on those earning more than 65,000 euros -lrb- $ 93,000 -rrb- a year . on foreign policy , the party regularly calls for an end to the german military 's participation in the nato-led stabilization mission in afghanistan and the dissolution of nato . party 's past makes cooperation difficult despite the left 's gains , the party is still seen as toxic by potential allies and foes alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentary leader gregor gysi transformed the party from its communist roots its predecessor , the socialist unity party , ruled east germany uninterruptedly from the country 's founding in 1949 until 1990 , when it was voted out of office in east germany 's only free and fair election . after changing its name to the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , it continued to hold seats in state parliaments across the former east germany once the two germanies reunited in 1990 but drew almost no voters in the west . the party reinvented itself in 2007 , when it merged with a small western german leftist party , the wasg , to form the left party .
the merger with the wasg brought former spd leader and saarland premier oskar lafontaine in as party leader . lafontaine stormed out of the spd in 2005 and since then has sought to bring other disaffected former spd members into the left party .
though the two parties have not ruled out governing together in a state-level coalition , on sunday night spd leaders were quick to disavow any cooperation with the left party ahead of national elections next month . " on the federal level it 's very clear , there will not be cooperation with the left , " said spd head franz muentering after preliminary election results were announced . a threat to the spd the spd will have to tread lightly in any cooperation it offers with the left party .
rivals from the market-oriented free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have sniped that the left party is not fit to govern due to its communist past . last year , a botched attempt by the spd in hesse to rely on the informal support of the left party to topple a cdu government failed after spd leaders there had initially ruled out any cooperation with the left . immediately after preliminary election results became available sunday evening , fdp head guido westerwelle said the possible left-leaning coalitions that include the sdp and left party in thuringia and saarland were a " warning shot " for germany . " those who do n't want socialists and communists to again have a say , must go to the federal elections and choose the middle-class by voting for a strong fdp , " westerwelle said in a statement . the cdu sunday night promised not to run a so-called ' red sock ' campaign against the spd for its cooperation with the left .
the cdu has relied on such campaigns in the past against the left 's predecessors to make political inroads in eastern germany . author : brett neely / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .
" if citizens get the impression that there is a lot at stake in a state election and that their vote might really count , then interest in elections tends to go up . "
fickle voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans vote in three state and one municipal election on sunday having real political alternatives to vote for can also make a difference , bernhard wessels told deutsche welle .
the senior researcher from the social science research center berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- said that international comparative analyses show those are conditions that can be applied to democratic elections in any country . also , " if elections are close , turnout is higher . "
municipal elections also suffer from low voter participation .
if there is a particular issue on hand , the turnout might be quite high , wessels pointed out , but basically , voters feel that the laws that really affect them are not made on the municipal level .
he said the national polls are regarded as " real elections , where the state of the nation is decided . "
for parliamentary elections , germany is one of the western democracies with the highest voter turnout , wessels said .
only in countries like belgium , which has a compulsory voting system , is turnout higher .
in 2005 , voter turnout in the german parliamentary election was 77,7 percent – the lowest ever , and wessels speculated that participation in this year 's national polls on september 27 might even be lower , due to " a boring election campaign , and an outcome that seems to be clear to most people , so that it is not an incentive to go out and vote . "
but the researcher remained cautious .
" the experience in the last elections was that 40 percent of voters switched their opinion in the pre-election period , " he said .

in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .
" if citizens get the impression that there is a lot at stake in a state election and that their vote might really count , then interest in elections tends to go up . "
fickle voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans vote in three state and one municipal election on sunday having real political alternatives to vote for can also make a difference , bernhard wessels told deutsche welle .
the senior researcher from the social science research center berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- said that international comparative analyses show those are conditions that can be applied to democratic elections in any country . also , " if elections are close , turnout is higher . "
municipal elections also suffer from low voter participation .
if there is a particular issue on hand , the turnout might be quite high , wessels pointed out , but basically , voters feel that the laws that really affect them are not made on the municipal level .
he said the national polls are regarded as " real elections , where the state of the nation is decided . "
for parliamentary elections , germany is one of the western democracies with the highest voter turnout , wessels said .
only in countries like belgium , which has a compulsory voting system , is turnout higher .
in 2005 , voter turnout in the german parliamentary election was 77,7 percent – the lowest ever , and wessels speculated that participation in this year 's national polls on september 27 might even be lower , due to " a boring election campaign , and an outcome that seems to be clear to most people , so that it is not an incentive to go out and vote . "
but the researcher remained cautious .
" the experience in the last elections was that 40 percent of voters switched their opinion in the pre-election period , " he said .
" that is a lot - from one party to the other , from voting to non-voting , or from non-voting to voting . " db / nadine wojcik editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a parasite carried by the mosquito is responsible for west nile virus , which can infect humans and farm animals with encephalitis , an acute inflammation of the brain that can be fatal .
the mosquito originally comes from japan , korea and china , but in recent years has spread dramatically across the united states and parts of canada .
the mosquito was first discovered in europe in 2000 in france at an old tire depot but was believed to have been eradicated when the area was sprayed with pesticides .
isolated pockets of the mosquito also exist in belgium , but have not spread .
parasite expert alexander mathis from zurich university said the insect 's larva had been found at 122 of 3,500 locations tested in switzerland and germany .

separately , a report in germany says troops in afghanistan have criticized military equipment . brown , who visited helmand province , said boosting military training for afghan troops would enable them to " take more responsibility for their own affairs . "
" i think we could get another 50,000 afghan army personnel trained over the next year , " brown told reporters on saturday .
" they 're backed up by partnering and mentoring done by the british forces , " he added .
he said he had conveyed that message to both afghan president hamid karzai and to presidential candidate abdullah abdullah .
brown dismissed allegations that british forces were suffering from poor equipment and lack of support from london .
he stressed the soldiers were equipped with modern material to protect them against the insurgents ' attacks .
the british prime minister also called for better and speedier training of afghan security forces so that fighting the taliban could increasingly be shouldered by both nato and afghan forces .

brown announced that this autumn , up to 200 anti-explosives specialists would be dispatched to join british troops .
there are currently 9,000 british troops in afghanistan - mostly in helmand . 207 british soldiers have been killed since 2001 .

german magazine der spiegel on saturday cited an internal defense ministry document , saying that shoddy equipment put german troops at a disadvantage in the face of mounting attacks from the taliban .
the magazine quoted the document as saying the troops were facing a " critical " situation with vehicles and armory not working properly .
it added that bulletproof jackets were so bulky that soldiers can not aim their guns properly . also , the machine gun mounted on the armored vehicles was in effect only there for show , since it could only fire forwards and could not react to attacks from the side or rear of the vehicle . germany has around 4,000 troops stationed mostly in the northern kunduz region of afghanistan. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

separately , a report in germany says troops in afghanistan have criticized military equipment . brown , who visited helmand province , said boosting military training for afghan troops would enable them to " take more responsibility for their own affairs . "
" i think we could get another 50,000 afghan army personnel trained over the next year , " brown told reporters on saturday .
" they 're backed up by partnering and mentoring done by the british forces , " he added .
he said he had conveyed that message to both afghan president hamid karzai and to presidential candidate abdullah abdullah .
brown dismissed allegations that british forces were suffering from poor equipment and lack of support from london .
he stressed the soldiers were equipped with modern material to protect them against the insurgents ' attacks .
the british prime minister also called for better and speedier training of afghan security forces so that fighting the taliban could increasingly be shouldered by both nato and afghan forces .

the magazine quoted the document as saying the troops were facing a " critical " situation with vehicles and armory not working properly .

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .
" if citizens get the impression that there is a lot at stake in a state election and that their vote might really count , then interest in elections tends to go up . "
fickle voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans vote in three state and one municipal election on sunday having real political alternatives to vote for can also make a difference , bernhard wessels told deutsche welle .
the senior researcher from the social science research center berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- said that international comparative analyses show those are conditions that can be applied to democratic elections in any country . also , " if elections are close , turnout is higher . "
municipal elections also suffer from low voter participation .
if there is a particular issue on hand , the turnout might be quite high , wessels pointed out , but basically , voters feel that the laws that really affect them are not made on the municipal level .
he said the national polls are regarded as " real elections , where the state of the nation is decided . "
for parliamentary elections , germany is one of the western democracies with the highest voter turnout , wessels said .
only in countries like belgium , which has a compulsory voting system , is turnout higher .
in 2005 , voter turnout in the german parliamentary election was 77,7 percent – the lowest ever , and wessels speculated that participation in this year 's national polls on september 27 might even be lower , due to " a boring election campaign , and an outcome that seems to be clear to most people , so that it is not an incentive to go out and vote . "
but the researcher remained cautious .
" the experience in the last elections was that 40 percent of voters switched their opinion in the pre-election period , " he said .
" that is a lot - from one party to the other , from voting to non-voting , or from non-voting to voting . " db / nadine wojcik editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the store name is a blend of the words " garage " and " garbage " – a funky reflection of what gabarage does .
under gottwald-nathaniel 's direction , the staff takes left-over or used materials and in its garage-like workshop on in the viennese sixth district , transforms them into imaginative new designs .
at gabarage , old traffic signs become chairs and tables .
used footballs are transformed into vases .
puzzle pieces or small mechanical parts form one-of-a-kind earrings and necklaces .
objects and furniture that have won prestigious design awards in austria .
gottwald-nathaniel has a special name for what the store does : upcycling .
" we have more than before .
this is the meaning of upcycling , " explains gottwald-nathaniel .
" we design it up . "
beautiful things should be accessible to everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriele gottwald-nathaniel says they 're " upcycling " the objects but gottwald-nathaniel is n't just the founder and manager of gabarage : she 's also a social worker .
seven years ago , she convinced europe 's biggest drug and alcohol rehab organization , the anton proksch institute , to back her on setting up gabarage as a way to help reintegrate former addicts into the mainstream labor market .
what inspired her , she says , was her conviction that beautiful things should be accessible to everyone – from drug addicts to students to the wealthy .
she also believes that one of the causes of addiction is suppressed or stunted creativity and that if addicts were given the tools and space to tap into their creativity , recovery would be more successful .
" it is a necessary gift for ourselves to live our lives creatively , " she says .
" and if addicts were given the chance to be learn to be creative , i thought they could also learn to live in a different way . "
indeed , the success rate has been high .
each year , 20 new interns start work at gabarage , receiving a minimum-wage salary paid by the austrian state of 20,000 euros .
most stay a maximum of 12 months .
when they leave , 80 percent enter and remain within the mainstream labor market , working in everything from administration to road construction .
gunter , a 38-year-old former baker has been working at gabarage since 2002 .
when he first joined the staff , he 'd just gotten clean from addiction to everything from alcohol to heroin .
he now oversees production , helping new interns turn canvas billboards into groovy shoulder bags .
" i feel accepted , respected as a human being , " he says , standing beside a row of buzzing sewing machines .
" if you make a mistake , you wo n't lose your job .
that 's not the case with other places .
but being here gives me the space to grow . "
learning from mistakes also key to garbarage 's success is co-operation from some of the country 's top businesses such as knauf and siemens , who have donated used or extra materials and objects they would otherwise have to discard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shop 's objects and furniture have won prestigious design awards the growth of gabarage has n't been all innovative bliss , however . at first , interns brainstormed for design ideas with the help of local designers , then they sought out the material among various companies with which to realize their designs .
when that did n't work – it proved too difficult to find the needed specific material from discarded objects – they flipped the process .
they asked the companies for whatever leftovers they had , then they figured out what they could make out of it . they now take orders directly from corporations of 20 up to 4,000 items for product promotion or freebies .
gabarage 's designs at first also proved to be too high-concept and high priced , which kept potential customers away .
so they widened the price range – rings made out of old coins , for instance , sell for about 30 euros – and introduced more items that would appeal to younger people .
sales shot up .
the store 's new goals are to add an on-line shop , provide more places to help people create new lives , and most importantly , to go completely independent from any outside funding , says gottwald-nathaniel .
currently , the anton proksch institute and government cover most of the 1 million euro expenses , with sales making up for a 200,000-euro gap .
gottwald-nathaniel insists being financially independent is feasible , now that people have seen how addicts can – quite literally – design a new vision of their lives .

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "
analysts see a nationwide trend in the decline in voter turnout for state elections .
in saxony-anhalt in 2006 , a mere 44 percent went to the polls , but hilmer pointed out that this trend was reversible .
the infratest dimap manager said intense media coverage could influence voter participation , especially since this poll is viewed by many as a barometer of public sentiment for next month 's federal election .
" if citizens get the impression that there is a lot at stake in a state election and that their vote might really count , then interest in elections tends to go up . "
fickle voters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans vote in three state and one municipal election on sunday having real political alternatives to vote for can also make a difference , bernhard wessels told deutsche welle .
the senior researcher from the social science research center berlin -lrb- wzb -rrb- said that international comparative analyses show those are conditions that can be applied to democratic elections in any country . also , " if elections are close , turnout is higher . "
municipal elections also suffer from low voter participation .
if there is a particular issue on hand , the turnout might be quite high , wessels pointed out , but basically , voters feel that the laws that really affect them are not made on the municipal level .
he said the national polls are regarded as " real elections , where the state of the nation is decided . "
for parliamentary elections , germany is one of the western democracies with the highest voter turnout , wessels said .
only in countries like belgium , which has a compulsory voting system , is turnout higher .
in 2005 , voter turnout in the german parliamentary election was 77,7 percent – the lowest ever , and wessels speculated that participation in this year 's national polls on september 27 might even be lower , due to " a boring election campaign , and an outcome that seems to be clear to most people , so that it is not an incentive to go out and vote . "
but the researcher remained cautious .
" the experience in the last elections was that 40 percent of voters switched their opinion in the pre-election period , " he said .
" that is a lot - from one party to the other , from voting to non-voting , or from non-voting to voting . " db / nadine wojcik editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 . in thuringia in the former east germany , the party drew over 26 percent of the vote .
the party 's top candidate bodo ramelow could potentially become the state 's next premier depending on coalition negotiations .
ramelow would become the party 's first-ever premier in its current incarnation . the party has already been in a coalition with the center-left social democratic party in the state of berlin since 2001 .

the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who want a coalition with the cdu on the national level , are also hoping to pick up votes and enter state governments sunday .
tillich ahead in saxony in a mirror of national politics , saxony is currently governed by a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
the latest opinion polls show the cdu , led by incumbent premier stanislav tillich , comfortably ahead .
tillich may have the luxury of choosing his next coalition partner if the cdu wins big .
there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .
the fdp and greens are also minor forces in saxon politics , having respectively gotten only 5.9 and 5.1 percent of the vote in 2004 , just skimming over the minimum five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation .
althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .
right-wing extremism cause for concern in both saxony and thuringia , political observers are concerned that right-wing extremists might get a boost in part because of the timing of this year 's elections .
with many germans on summer vacation , low voter turnout could boost the chances of extremist parties , whose supporters are more motivated to vote .
anything possible in saarland in the state of saarland , in western germany along the french border , the outcome is unclear .
experts see any number of potential coalitions , including alliances between the spd and left party , the spd , the green party and left party , the cdu and fdp , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd , or a so-called jamaica coalition -lrb- named for the respective colors of each party -rrb- comprising the cdu , fdp and greens .

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .
as business sales and profits have shrunk with the global recession , the traditional benchmarks , which the banking sector has used in assessing applications , have become harder to meet .
exporters are in particular need of help .
bildunterschrift : german exporters in particular need help to ride out rough financial seas to assist germany 's hard-hit export sector , banks will be obliged to lend money equal in value to the government loan guarantees .
however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .
on tuesday , the steering committee of the german business fund , “ wirtschaftsfonds deutschland ” , will meet to discuss the proposal .
they also hope to establish a model to protect private lenders against loan default. ch / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

solana also said that an eu-syrian association agreement will be signed sometime before the end of the year .
even though syria is a signatory to the 1995 barcelona declaration , which aims to establish a free trade area after 2010 with all non-eu mediterranean countries , without an association agreement , syria can not benefit from the declaration .
at a joint press conference with syrian foreign affairs minister al muallim , solana said that eu-syrian relations are moving in the right direction .
al muallim said that for syria , the " palestinian dossier takes precedence , " whether it is " freezing settlements , lifting the blockade on gaza or making east jerusalem jewish . "
from damascus , solana heads for israel and talks with prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
from there he goes on to ramallah to visit with palestinian prime minister salam fayyad .
on tuesday he will be in lebanon and will make a stop in cairo on wednesday to round out the trip. av / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .

guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .

solana is on the first leg of a four-day tour of the region . speaking to reporters in damascus after talks with assad , solana said progress is being made in strengthening ties between syria and the european union . the talks included bilateral relations , the peace process in the middle east and syrian-iraqi relations .
assad on sunday called for stability in neighboring iraq , days after baghdad alleged that damascus is sheltering suspects linked to a massive bombing targeting government ministries on august 19 .
the attacks killed 95 people and wounded 600 , and baghdad has demanded that syria turn over one of the masterminds .
assad spoke of " the need to reach national reconciliation in iraq in order to achieve stability and security " there , during talks with solana , according to the syrian state-run sana news agency .
bildunterschrift : iraq 's finance ministry was targeted in the bombing assad has said that stability in iraq is in damascus 's best interest , but relations between the two countries are at such a low point that turkey has stepped in to see if it can try and resolve the differences between them .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu is to visit baghdad and damascus on monday august 31 .
free trade pact to take effect solana said that the eu was setting a plan for peace and stability in the region and that " syria has an important role . "
assad said that he is in favor of a peace deal with israel based on implementation of united nations resolutions 242 and 338 .
the resolutions call for israeli withdrawal from territories it occupied during the 1967 war and include the golan heights , the west bank and east jerusalem .
solana also said that an eu-syrian association agreement will be signed sometime before the end of the year .
even though syria is a signatory to the 1995 barcelona declaration , which aims to establish a free trade area after 2010 with all non-eu mediterranean countries , without an association agreement , syria can not benefit from the declaration .
at a joint press conference with syrian foreign affairs minister al muallim , solana said that eu-syrian relations are moving in the right direction .
al muallim said that for syria , the " palestinian dossier takes precedence , " whether it is " freezing settlements , lifting the blockade on gaza or making east jerusalem jewish . "
from damascus , solana heads for israel and talks with prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
from there he goes on to ramallah to visit with palestinian prime minister salam fayyad .

driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 30.08.2009 anti-nuclear trek to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tractors carry anti-nuclear protestors toward berlin where to store germany 's nuclear waste ?
the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , federal environment minister and social democrat the social democrats insist that conservative-led regional governments in germany 's southern states of baden-wurttemburg and bavaria look for alternative sites to gorleben in their own backyards – sites capable of storing waste such as plutonium which has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years .
conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .
granite has too many cracks , making it too dangerous .
there is only one location , which has been well investigated .
we should implement it .
the taxpayers , by the way , have paid a lot of money for -lsb- gorleben -rsb- – 1.5 billion euros . ”
the pro-nuclear lobby group deutsche atomforum recently said german firms such as siemens , oen and rwe are tapping into renewed global interest , with over 30 reactors currently under construction worldwide .
greens accuse government of breaking its word joining the fray are the greens , who 've long lobbied for alternative sustainable energy sources in germany .
greens co-leader for the general election , renate kunast , says the government ran a campaign of obfuscation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate kunast says enough with the lies about gorleben “ it 's been discovered that the experts ' report was falsified , " she says . " we were always told – gorleben is suitable .
and , now it has emerged that in 1982 the experts had had doubts and said other sites should be investigated , and that they were put under pressure from the-then government to delete some legislative elements . ”
fellow greens candidate juergen trittin accuses chancellor merkel 's coalition of not keeping its word in failing to complete an impartial search beyond gorleben for an alternative site by the end of the legislative period in september . german public sceptical despite claims by nuclear advocates that atomic energy is needed in the energy mix alongside renewables – at least in the medium term to head off climate change and future oil price hikes – surveys in germany show that a majority of germans remain sceptical about the nuclear industry , in part also because of the potential that terrorists could target nuclear facilities . past shipments of reprocessed german nuclear waste from france to gorleben have drawn extensive protests watched over by large squads of police .
a new survey by the polling institute forsa show that 57 percent of germany 's residents still favour the legislated phasing out of nuclear power stations by 2021 .
that leaves a minority of 38 percent who would tolerate longer usage of nuclear power. ipj / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , federal environment minister and social democrat the social democrats insist that conservative-led regional governments in germany 's southern states of baden-wurttemburg and bavaria look for alternative sites to gorleben in their own backyards – sites capable of storing waste such as plutonium which has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years .
conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .
granite has too many cracks , making it too dangerous .
there is only one location , which has been well investigated .
we should implement it .
the taxpayers , by the way , have paid a lot of money for -lsb- gorleben -rsb- – 1.5 billion euros . ”
the pro-nuclear lobby group deutsche atomforum recently said german firms such as siemens , oen and rwe are tapping into renewed global interest , with over 30 reactors currently under construction worldwide .
greens accuse government of breaking its word joining the fray are the greens , who 've long lobbied for alternative sustainable energy sources in germany .
greens co-leader for the general election , renate kunast , says the government ran a campaign of obfuscation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate kunast says enough with the lies about gorleben “ it 's been discovered that the experts ' report was falsified , " she says . " we were always told – gorleben is suitable .
and , now it has emerged that in 1982 the experts had had doubts and said other sites should be investigated , and that they were put under pressure from the-then government to delete some legislative elements . ”
fellow greens candidate juergen trittin accuses chancellor merkel 's coalition of not keeping its word in failing to complete an impartial search beyond gorleben for an alternative site by the end of the legislative period in september . german public sceptical despite claims by nuclear advocates that atomic energy is needed in the energy mix alongside renewables – at least in the medium term to head off climate change and future oil price hikes – surveys in germany show that a majority of germans remain sceptical about the nuclear industry , in part also because of the potential that terrorists could target nuclear facilities . past shipments of reprocessed german nuclear waste from france to gorleben have drawn extensive protests watched over by large squads of police .
a new survey by the polling institute forsa show that 57 percent of germany 's residents still favour the legislated phasing out of nuclear power stations by 2021 .
that leaves a minority of 38 percent who would tolerate longer usage of nuclear power. ipj / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.08.2009 german parties face key test in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's cdu could lose power in two state elections sunday voters will decide the fate of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu in three state-level elections sunday .
the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who want a coalition with the cdu on the national level , are also hoping to pick up votes and enter state governments sunday .
tillich ahead in saxony in a mirror of national politics , saxony is currently governed by a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
the latest opinion polls show the cdu , led by incumbent premier stanislav tillich , comfortably ahead .
tillich may have the luxury of choosing his next coalition partner if the cdu wins big .
there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .
the fdp and greens are also minor forces in saxon politics , having respectively gotten only 5.9 and 5.1 percent of the vote in 2004 , just skimming over the minimum five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation .
althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .
right-wing extremism cause for concern in both saxony and thuringia , political observers are concerned that right-wing extremists might get a boost in part because of the timing of this year 's elections .
with many germans on summer vacation , low voter turnout could boost the chances of extremist parties , whose supporters are more motivated to vote .
anything possible in saarland in the state of saarland , in western germany along the french border , the outcome is unclear .
experts see any number of potential coalitions , including alliances between the spd and left party , the spd , the green party and left party , the cdu and fdp , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd , or a so-called jamaica coalition -lrb- named for the respective colors of each party -rrb- comprising the cdu , fdp and greens .
in any case , opinion polls suggest that incumbent cdu state premier , peter müller , like althaus in thuringia , may lose his absolute majority . bildunterschrift : the czar of the saar : peter müller -lrb- center -rrb- on the campaign trail with chancellor angela merkel bn / gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the polls could also lead to western germany 's first left-wing coalition between social democrats and the left party . voters in the former east german states of saxony and thuringia as well as the western german state of saarland are electing new state parliaments .
the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .

political parties in four german states , which go to the polls on sunday , are having a hard time persuading people to vote .
the polls could have an impact on the federal election in september . some 6.2 million voters go to the polls in the ex-communist eastern states of saxony and thuringia and the western state of saarland on sunday to cast ballots for their state premiers and state parliaments .
in addition , 14.4 million eligible voters are being asked to choose their local mayors and town council representatives in municipal elections in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
but voter turnout has been on the decline for decades in germany .
in the 1970s , about 80 percent of german voters took part in state elections .
today , that figure has dwindled to an average of 67 percent . five years ago , thuringia , saxony and saarland - the three states voting for new state assemblies on sunday - actually faced historically low turnout levels .
widespread voter apathy richard hilmer , managing director of infratest dimap , one of germany 's leading opinion research institutes , said non-voters fall into distinctly different groups .
" there is the notorious non-voter , who actually never casts a ballot , " he said .
" others decide every single time whether they are going to participate in the elections or not .
and then , there are those who fall victim to a sudden illness or other last-minute problem . "

a parasite carried by the mosquito is responsible for west nile virus , which can infect humans and farm animals with encephalitis , an acute inflammation of the brain that can be fatal .
the mosquito originally comes from japan , korea and china , but in recent years has spread dramatically across the united states and parts of canada .
the mosquito was first discovered in europe in 2000 in france at an old tire depot but was believed to have been eradicated when the area was sprayed with pesticides .
isolated pockets of the mosquito also exist in belgium , but have not spread .
parasite expert alexander mathis from zurich university said the insect 's larva had been found at 122 of 3,500 locations tested in switzerland and germany .
mathis said the find indicates that the species had gained a foothold in europe and was spreading. gb / ap / glp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .

on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .

tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

german troops suffer from poor equipment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops say poor equipment puts them at risk brown 's visit to helmand comes amid reports in germany that german troops are suffering from poor equipment in their struggle against insurgents in the north of afghanistan .
german magazine der spiegel on saturday cited an internal defense ministry document , saying that shoddy equipment put german troops at a disadvantage in the face of mounting attacks from the taliban .
the magazine quoted the document as saying the troops were facing a " critical " situation with vehicles and armory not working properly .
it added that bulletproof jackets were so bulky that soldiers can not aim their guns properly . also , the machine gun mounted on the armored vehicles was in effect only there for show , since it could only fire forwards and could not react to attacks from the side or rear of the vehicle . germany has around 4,000 troops stationed mostly in the northern kunduz region of afghanistan. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

assad on sunday called for stability in neighboring iraq , days after baghdad alleged that damascus is sheltering suspects linked to a massive bombing targeting government ministries on august 19 .

solana also said that an eu-syrian association agreement will be signed sometime before the end of the year .
even though syria is a signatory to the 1995 barcelona declaration , which aims to establish a free trade area after 2010 with all non-eu mediterranean countries , without an association agreement , syria can not benefit from the declaration .

solana is on the first leg of a four-day tour of the region . speaking to reporters in damascus after talks with assad , solana said progress is being made in strengthening ties between syria and the european union . the talks included bilateral relations , the peace process in the middle east and syrian-iraqi relations .
assad on sunday called for stability in neighboring iraq , days after baghdad alleged that damascus is sheltering suspects linked to a massive bombing targeting government ministries on august 19 .
the attacks killed 95 people and wounded 600 , and baghdad has demanded that syria turn over one of the masterminds .
assad spoke of " the need to reach national reconciliation in iraq in order to achieve stability and security " there , during talks with solana , according to the syrian state-run sana news agency .
bildunterschrift : iraq 's finance ministry was targeted in the bombing assad has said that stability in iraq is in damascus 's best interest , but relations between the two countries are at such a low point that turkey has stepped in to see if it can try and resolve the differences between them .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu is to visit baghdad and damascus on monday august 31 .
free trade pact to take effect solana said that the eu was setting a plan for peace and stability in the region and that " syria has an important role . "
assad said that he is in favor of a peace deal with israel based on implementation of united nations resolutions 242 and 338 .
the resolutions call for israeli withdrawal from territories it occupied during the 1967 war and include the golan heights , the west bank and east jerusalem .
solana also said that an eu-syrian association agreement will be signed sometime before the end of the year .
even though syria is a signatory to the 1995 barcelona declaration , which aims to establish a free trade area after 2010 with all non-eu mediterranean countries , without an association agreement , syria can not benefit from the declaration .
at a joint press conference with syrian foreign affairs minister al muallim , solana said that eu-syrian relations are moving in the right direction .
al muallim said that for syria , the " palestinian dossier takes precedence , " whether it is " freezing settlements , lifting the blockade on gaza or making east jerusalem jewish . "
from damascus , solana heads for israel and talks with prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
from there he goes on to ramallah to visit with palestinian prime minister salam fayyad .

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " castor " nuclear containers at gorleben added to that are land expropriation provisions that are due to expire at gorleben in 2015 .
there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .
it failed to acknowledge the need for a sensible site selection process . it failed to acknowledge international standards .
and , it wanted , apparently , to force through gorleben , with the same mistakes as at the salt dome asse . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , federal environment minister and social democrat the social democrats insist that conservative-led regional governments in germany 's southern states of baden-wurttemburg and bavaria look for alternative sites to gorleben in their own backyards – sites capable of storing waste such as plutonium which has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years .
conservatives reluctant to relinquish nuclear power the rebuttal has come from bavaria 's own environment minister markus söder , a leading figure among bavarian csu conservatives who are allied with chancellor merkel . söder accuses the social democrat gabriel of exploiting gorleben for electoral purposes . gorleben , which lies nearly 500 kilometers to the north of bavaria , is the best investigated long-term disposal site for germany , söder says .
“ gorleben is suitable . it 's also clear that we do n't have any alternative location , for example in bavaria , because the clay layers that we have are too thin in comparison to salt domes .
granite has too many cracks , making it too dangerous .
there is only one location , which has been well investigated .
we should implement it .
the taxpayers , by the way , have paid a lot of money for -lsb- gorleben -rsb- – 1.5 billion euros . ”
the pro-nuclear lobby group deutsche atomforum recently said german firms such as siemens , oen and rwe are tapping into renewed global interest , with over 30 reactors currently under construction worldwide .
greens accuse government of breaking its word joining the fray are the greens , who 've long lobbied for alternative sustainable energy sources in germany .
greens co-leader for the general election , renate kunast , says the government ran a campaign of obfuscation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate kunast says enough with the lies about gorleben “ it 's been discovered that the experts ' report was falsified , " she says . " we were always told – gorleben is suitable .
and , now it has emerged that in 1982 the experts had had doubts and said other sites should be investigated , and that they were put under pressure from the-then government to delete some legislative elements . ”
fellow greens candidate juergen trittin accuses chancellor merkel 's coalition of not keeping its word in failing to complete an impartial search beyond gorleben for an alternative site by the end of the legislative period in september . german public sceptical despite claims by nuclear advocates that atomic energy is needed in the energy mix alongside renewables – at least in the medium term to head off climate change and future oil price hikes – surveys in germany show that a majority of germans remain sceptical about the nuclear industry , in part also because of the potential that terrorists could target nuclear facilities . past shipments of reprocessed german nuclear waste from france to gorleben have drawn extensive protests watched over by large squads of police .
a new survey by the polling institute forsa show that 57 percent of germany 's residents still favour the legislated phasing out of nuclear power stations by 2021 .
that leaves a minority of 38 percent who would tolerate longer usage of nuclear power. ipj / dpa / reuters / ap / afp editor : carl holm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue – decades old and still unresolved – has injected controversy into campaigning ahead of germany ’ s federal election on 27 september . farm residents at gorleben in northern germany have long opposed a proposal that salt caverns under their feet be used as the nation 's long-term underground nuclear waste disposal site .
driving tractors , they have begun a week-long road trek to berlin to press their anti-nuclear case .
equipped with a rolling kitchen , they aim to spearhead a demonstration in the capital next saturday .
en route , the tractor trekkers plan stopovers at three other sites used variously as nuclear storages and all controversial - the former konrad iron mine near salzgitter ; asse , a mine with water leaks near wolfenbüttel ; and morsleben , an old salt mine near the former east-west-german border .
nuclear industry proponents accuse detractors of exaggerating the risks .
incidents variously interpreted the anti-nuclear lobby has drawn impetus from recent shutdowns at the krummel nuclear power plant in the northern state of schleswig- holstein and new allegations dating back to 1982 . according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , the then conservative-led government of helmut kohl pressured scientists to " sugarcoat " a report on storage prospects at gorleben .
the scientists were reportedly worried that sediment around the salt-cave was not impermeable enough to stop potential radiation leaks .

there 's also been an official disclosure that another underground site , asse , which is at risk because of alkaline groundwater leaching , contains 28 kilograms of highly radioactive plutonium .
that 's three times the amount originally notified by nuclear authorities .
asse also stores 126,000 barrels of low and medium grade radioactive waste , dumped in the 1960s and 70s .
nuclear power station phase-out due by 2021 the social democrats , who in 2000 under former chancellor gerhard schroeder , together with the greens , saw through legislation to mothball germany 's 17 nuclear power generating reactors by 2021 , have seized upon the nuclear issue in what had been otherwise a lacklustre federal election campaign . sigmar gabriel is a social democrat from lower saxony state where gorleben is located and also federal environment minister in the outgoing coalition cabinet of conservative christian democrat chancellor angela merkel .
gabriel says gorleben , due to legalities , is now out of the question .
“ the location gorleben is dead as a final storage site .
responsible for this situation is the cdu which , come what may , wanted to force it through .

solana is on the first leg of a four-day tour of the region . speaking to reporters in damascus after talks with assad , solana said progress is being made in strengthening ties between syria and the european union . the talks included bilateral relations , the peace process in the middle east and syrian-iraqi relations .
assad on sunday called for stability in neighboring iraq , days after baghdad alleged that damascus is sheltering suspects linked to a massive bombing targeting government ministries on august 19 .
the attacks killed 95 people and wounded 600 , and baghdad has demanded that syria turn over one of the masterminds .
assad spoke of " the need to reach national reconciliation in iraq in order to achieve stability and security " there , during talks with solana , according to the syrian state-run sana news agency .
bildunterschrift : iraq 's finance ministry was targeted in the bombing assad has said that stability in iraq is in damascus 's best interest , but relations between the two countries are at such a low point that turkey has stepped in to see if it can try and resolve the differences between them .
turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu is to visit baghdad and damascus on monday august 31 .
free trade pact to take effect solana said that the eu was setting a plan for peace and stability in the region and that " syria has an important role . "
assad said that he is in favor of a peace deal with israel based on implementation of united nations resolutions 242 and 338 .
the resolutions call for israeli withdrawal from territories it occupied during the 1967 war and include the golan heights , the west bank and east jerusalem .
solana also said that an eu-syrian association agreement will be signed sometime before the end of the year .
even though syria is a signatory to the 1995 barcelona declaration , which aims to establish a free trade area after 2010 with all non-eu mediterranean countries , without an association agreement , syria can not benefit from the declaration .
at a joint press conference with syrian foreign affairs minister al muallim , solana said that eu-syrian relations are moving in the right direction .
al muallim said that for syria , the " palestinian dossier takes precedence , " whether it is " freezing settlements , lifting the blockade on gaza or making east jerusalem jewish . "
from damascus , solana heads for israel and talks with prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
from there he goes on to ramallah to visit with palestinian prime minister salam fayyad .
on tuesday he will be in lebanon and will make a stop in cairo on wednesday to round out the trip. av / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
one of the newspaper 's editors , tran cong khanh , said duc was dismissed because his posts were not in line with the paper 's editorial positions .
although duc 's osin blog has repeatedly pushed the limits of vietnam 's repressive , state-controlled media , it was a post in which he praised the fall of the berlin wall that cost him his job as a reporter .
in the post , duc called the berlin wall a " wall of shame , " and accused the soviet union of imposing " a regime which deprived men of fundamental rights " on eastern europe .
after the vietnam war ended in 1975 , the soviet union was vietnam 's main ally until the bloc collapsed in 1991 .
" the attitude of his entry did not reflect that of our newspaper , and we ca n't use him anymore , " khanh said .
the editor said that the newspaper made the decision to dismiss duc on its own , without direct pressure from the government , but added that the state 's media watchdog , the propaganda and education commission , had issued complaints about scores of duc 's blog entries and newspaper stories .
tougher regulations on bloggers in a post on wednesday , duc confirmed that he was " no longer a reporter of saigon tiep thi , " where he 'd worked for almost four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam 's communist rulers have been cracking down on the political blogosphere like all of vietnam 's roughly 700 news outlets , the newspaper is subject to state control .
but duc wrote that even under such conditions , the press " must be the place to convey honest stories , analysis and criticism … articles that journalists believe serve society . "
on his osin blog , he has frequently posted items critical of government leaders and their policies on major issues such as corruption , relations with china , and treatment of the media .
although duc declined to comment directly about his dismissal , he wrote on his blog that he 's lost many newspaper jobs during his 21 years as a journalist , and that he now plans to work on a book .
in a statement , the german chapter of reporters without borders -lrb- rog -rrb- criticized saigon tiep thi 's decision to fire duc .
" rog condemns this arbitary dismissal , " the organization said .
" with its decision , the saigon tiep thi newspaper is contributing to state-sponsored censorship . "
rog added that state control of online media and blogs that are critical of the government is increasing in vietnam , which is currently in 168th place on a list of 173 countries evaluated for freedom of the press .
at the end of last year , the vietnamese government tightened its rules for bloggers , who have proliferated in vietnam and become an important source of news for many in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blogging has taken off in vietnam in recent years under the new rules , bloggers should write only about personal , not political , matters , and use " clean and wholesome " language .
internet service providers are responsible for the content of the blogs they hose , and are obligated to report to the government every six months and provide information about bloggers on request .
bloggers told to stay away from politics there have been several recent examples of the vietnamese government 's willingness to crack down on those who break the rules .
among them is the case of nguyen van hai , a blogger known as " dieu cay " who was arrested in april 2008 on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
his sentence was largely seen as punishment for using his blog to call for a boycott of china 's olympic torch relay when it passed through ho chi minh city .
and in june 2008 , a court sentenced journalist nguyen viet chien to two years in prison for investigating a notorious 2006 corruption scandal in vietnam , in which millions of dollars of public funds were used to bet on european soccer matches .
four other journalists had their press credentials revoked for criticizing his arrest , according to the associated press .
he was granted an early release on jan.17 , 2009 .

the elections are the last litmus test of voter sentiment for germany 's political parties before the september 27 national poll .
early turnout data suggests that voter turnout was high in saarland and thuringia , reflecting contested and close races in those states , while turnout in saxony was far below levels seen in the last election in 2004 .
all three states are currently governed by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic union .
if the cdu manages to hold onto power , merkel 's already leading position in the federal election will be strengthened .
her opponents in the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who are lagging in the polls , hope sunday 's results will reinvigorate the demoralized party .
sunday 's vote could also rewrite germany 's political map , with a left-wing coalition between the spd and the left party possible in saarland , the first such grouping in western germany .
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who want a coalition with the cdu on the national level , are also hoping to pick up votes and enter state governments sunday .
tillich ahead in saxony in a mirror of national politics , saxony is currently governed by a grand coalition of the cdu and spd .
the latest opinion polls show the cdu , led by incumbent premier stanislav tillich , comfortably ahead .
tillich may have the luxury of choosing his next coalition partner if the cdu wins big .
there are signs he could opt for a coalition with the fdp instead , previewing a similar alliance on the national level .
bildunterschrift : saxony 's stanislav tillich can relax because he is expected to win his contest easily the spd is a small force in saxony , having drawn only 9.8 percent of the vote in 2004 , barely more than the right-wing extremist npd , which got 9.2 percent of the vote .
by contrast , the left party , descendants of former east germany 's ruling communist party , pulled in 23.6 percent .
the fdp and greens are also minor forces in saxon politics , having respectively gotten only 5.9 and 5.1 percent of the vote in 2004 , just skimming over the minimum five-percent hurdle for parliamentary representation .
althaus poised to lose his absolute majority next door in thuringia , the situation is more complicated as premier dieter althaus looks set to lose his absolute majority and has openly campaigned for a coalition with his preferred partner , the fdp .
althaus 's reputation has suffered since a ski accident last winter in which althaus collided with a woman and killed her .
bildunterschrift : new term or not ?
that is the big question for thuringia 's state premier dieter althaus less certain is who will come in second behind althaus and the cdu .
the spd and the left party have been duelling for second place , but recent surveys show the left party pulling ahead .
polls also suggest the greens and the fdp could fall short of the five percent hurdle and lose their seats in the state parliament .
right-wing extremism cause for concern in both saxony and thuringia , political observers are concerned that right-wing extremists might get a boost in part because of the timing of this year 's elections .
with many germans on summer vacation , low voter turnout could boost the chances of extremist parties , whose supporters are more motivated to vote .
anything possible in saarland in the state of saarland , in western germany along the french border , the outcome is unclear .
experts see any number of potential coalitions , including alliances between the spd and left party , the spd , the green party and left party , the cdu and fdp , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd , or a so-called jamaica coalition -lrb- named for the respective colors of each party -rrb- comprising the cdu , fdp and greens .
in any case , opinion polls suggest that incumbent cdu state premier , peter müller , like althaus in thuringia , may lose his absolute majority . bildunterschrift : the czar of the saar : peter müller -lrb- center -rrb- on the campaign trail with chancellor angela merkel bn / gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the christian social union politician from bavaria said that there were concerns that small and medium-sized businesses could face a situation where credit was cut off .
he suggested that , to prevent this from happening , the state-run kfw banking group should make available a universal loan to the commercial banking sector .
guttenberg said banks needed to be ready to make loan approvals process quick and easy for business customers .
the money is likely to come out of the 100 billion euro “ deutschlandfonds ” - a bailout fund created earlier this year in the wake of the global financial crisis .
government to take over default risk to further encourage german banks to loosen their purse strings , guttenberg suggested that in return for relaxing certain lending criteria , the government would assume 90 percent of the risk on business loans , leaving the banks with just ten percent .
so far , despite billions of euros in government liquidity assistance , german banks have been reluctant to let that money flow any further down the economic food-chain to where it 's really needed to keep economic activity alive .
as business sales and profits have shrunk with the global recession , the traditional benchmarks , which the banking sector has used in assessing applications , have become harder to meet .
exporters are in particular need of help .
bildunterschrift : german exporters in particular need help to ride out rough financial seas to assist germany 's hard-hit export sector , banks will be obliged to lend money equal in value to the government loan guarantees .
however , minister guttenberg stressed that there would be no direct government loans to exporters .
guttenberg 's proposals come just days after germany 's finance minister , social democrat peer steinbrueck , made similar suggestions .
“ when the efforts of the banking sector are not resulting in credit flowing to businesses , the state has to use new tools to bring some leverage , ” steinbrueck said .
he also pointed out that the risk of businesses defaulting on loans was low .
on tuesday , the steering committee of the german business fund , “ wirtschaftsfonds deutschland ” , will meet to discuss the proposal .
they also hope to establish a model to protect private lenders against loan default. ch / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fans of the sheffield band sang all the words to songs from their third album humbug , only released on monday .
but old favourites like i bet you look good on the dancefloor and when the sun goes down provided the real highlights .
the new album was mostly produced by josh homme , the frontman of us hard rockers queens of the stone age , in the californian desert .
among the spectators , plumber bobby young , 34 , from glasgow , said the mixture of old and new was " sound , really good " .
" the punters liked the tunes they knew - something they could sing along to , " he said .
' ghostly surreal ' " but i think it was pretty good they played the new stuff too .
it was ballsy to do that . "
his favourite song had been the band 's last of the night , 505 - from second album favourite worst nightmare - because " it brings a wee tear to the eye " .
frontman alex turner told the bbc last month the band were " a bit more ready " for their performances at reading and its sister festival in leeds than they had been for their last uk festival outings in the summer of 2007 , which included headlining at glastonbury .
" glastonbury taught us that ; i think we grew up in some way , " turner said .
that new-found maturity was evident in songs from humbug , and from the opening chiming guitar riff of set-opener my propeller , the reading crowd seemed to be on board .
" coax me out , my love , and have a spin of my propeller , " sang turner and thousands of others as the drums dropped out early in the song .
with the audience in the palm of their hand , it seemed a strange choice then to follow with a relatively obscure cover - red right hand by nick cave and the bad seeds - the b-side to humbug 's lead single crying lightning .
the band - who topped a reading bill that included prodigy , maximo park and ian brown - immediately resumed full service with that ghostly surreal single - which turner himself describes as " strange as far as a pop song goes " .
homme 's rocky influence became clearer as the song was played out to more cheers .
' fever pitch ' but the new songs played on saturday night which really stood out -lrb- as well as my propeller -rrb- were secret door - with its refrain of " fools on parade " - and cornerstone , the story of a boy who asks a succession of girls if he can call them by the name of his lost love .
all three were produced not by homme but by james ford , who helmed favourite worst nightmare as well as the age of the understatement by turner 's 1960s-influenced side project , the last shadow puppets .
and all three songs are typical of the warped love stories , imbued with turner 's wry social observation , that the band have built their name on .
it is no coincidence , then , that the band 's earlier efforts - including i bet you look good on the dancefloor , when the sun goes down , fluorescent adolescent and brianstorm - took the atmosphere at reading to fever pitch .
the acrobatic drumming of matt helders - the only arctic monkey not to have grown long rock star hair in the interim - helped to drive the crowd and the band into that frenzy .
unsurprisingly , the new songs - which have been in the public domain for less than a week - did not have the same impact as these old favourites .
but the fans will grow into them with time , as will the band .
musician dan jones , 24 , said : " i saw them at leeds last night but they were better tonight .
" the new songs were really good .
i like secret door , that 's a favourite of mine , i really like that song - i thought it went down fantastic . "
helen clements , 27 , from london , meanwhile , said of the new material : " i thought it was good but i thought it was a bit slow . "
some will have left the festival site disappointed by the omission of a couple of singles - including teddy picker from favourite worst nightmare .
the only other thing missing from the performance was interaction between turner and the crowd .
for one who has so much to say in his cleverly-crafted lyrics , the 23-year-old yorkshireman is a man of few words on stage .
" we 're gonna leave you now , " he said at the end .
" and i think if i 'm just brusque about it like that , it 's better that way .
it 's easier for me that way . "
