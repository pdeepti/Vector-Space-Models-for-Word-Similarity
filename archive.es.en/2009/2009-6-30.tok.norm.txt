that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .
different take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke says lisbon would undercut german sovereignty the case against the treaty was brought by an unlikely coalition of plaintiffs . both the far-left political party die linke and the right-wing bavarian parliamentarian peter gauweiler , as well as group of professors , argued the lisbon treaty would allow eu leaders to circumvent national parliaments and push decisions through in brussels instead . die linke issued a statement on its website following the court 's announcement saying it too was encouraged by the decision .
the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .
" the -lrb- court 's -rrb- judgment is a double success , " kuenast said .
" it is a clear ‘ yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the rightist and leftist plaintiffs have been rejected … and the constitutional court has consciously dealt out more rights to parliamentarians . "
she said the move was a success for parliamentary democracy .
" now the members of the bundestag are in a very strong position as they reformulate the bill accompanying the treaty . " dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the improvement could give a slight boost to german chancellor angela merkel 's reelection bid . german unemployment for june sank slightly on figures for the previous month , retreating by 48,000 to 3.410 million , according to the federal labor agency figures .
that represents a drop of 0.1 percent , to a seasonally adjusted jobless rate of 8.1 percent .
the figures had been the source of fevered speculation prior to their release , as germany prepares for general elections in september .
a rise in unemployment could have boded ill for chancellor merkel and her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
government-subsidized short-term work contracts have so far helped companies steer clear of mass layoffs despite weakening export markets and declining consumer confidence at home .
the slight fall in german unemployment reinforces recent economic sentiment surveys pointing to expectations of a turnaround in both the european and the german economies as the year progresses .
experts have , however warned that unemployment figures could top 4.1 million by the end of 2009 , if the german economy follows predictions and contracts by more than 6 percent this year .
there are global concerns that the economic crisis could manifest itself as a jobs crisis by year 's end. ch / reuters / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

delegates are to sign a non-binding declaration in the czech republic on tuesday . " a major accomplishment " was how stuart eizenstat , head of the american delegation to the prague holocaust assets conference , described the outcome of the five-day event . it was the last event of the six-month czech eu presidency , and one clearly designed to make a major impact .
delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .
different take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke says lisbon would undercut german sovereignty the case against the treaty was brought by an unlikely coalition of plaintiffs . both the far-left political party die linke and the right-wing bavarian parliamentarian peter gauweiler , as well as group of professors , argued the lisbon treaty would allow eu leaders to circumvent national parliaments and push decisions through in brussels instead . die linke issued a statement on its website following the court 's announcement saying it too was encouraged by the decision .
the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .
" the -lrb- court 's -rrb- judgment is a double success , " kuenast said .
" it is a clear ‘ yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the rightist and leftist plaintiffs have been rejected … and the constitutional court has consciously dealt out more rights to parliamentarians . "
she said the move was a success for parliamentary democracy .
" now the members of the bundestag are in a very strong position as they reformulate the bill accompanying the treaty . " dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the improvement could give a slight boost to german chancellor angela merkel 's reelection bid . german unemployment for june sank slightly on figures for the previous month , retreating by 48,000 to 3.410 million , according to the federal labor agency figures .
that represents a drop of 0.1 percent , to a seasonally adjusted jobless rate of 8.1 percent .
the figures had been the source of fevered speculation prior to their release , as germany prepares for general elections in september .
a rise in unemployment could have boded ill for chancellor merkel and her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
government-subsidized short-term work contracts have so far helped companies steer clear of mass layoffs despite weakening export markets and declining consumer confidence at home .
the slight fall in german unemployment reinforces recent economic sentiment surveys pointing to expectations of a turnaround in both the european and the german economies as the year progresses .
experts have , however warned that unemployment figures could top 4.1 million by the end of 2009 , if the german economy follows predictions and contracts by more than 6 percent this year .
there are global concerns that the economic crisis could manifest itself as a jobs crisis by year 's end. ch / reuters / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

delegates are to sign a non-binding declaration in the czech republic on tuesday . " a major accomplishment " was how stuart eizenstat , head of the american delegation to the prague holocaust assets conference , described the outcome of the five-day event . it was the last event of the six-month czech eu presidency , and one clearly designed to make a major impact .
delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .
some critics believe such meetings are good on words ; creating action to match those words is far more difficult . author : rob cameron editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de archeology -pipe- 30.06.2009 mesopotamian vase sheds light on germany 's artefacts trade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi authorities say they do n't want the vase back a legal dispute surrounding an antique golden vase being held in a museum vault in mainz shines light on the surprisingly important role germany plays in the often shady world of antiques trading . the case sounds more like an esoteric crime novel than a simple legal tussle , involving as it does archaeologists , rare-coin dealers , customs officials , and the iraqi embassy in berlin .
at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .
different take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke says lisbon would undercut german sovereignty the case against the treaty was brought by an unlikely coalition of plaintiffs . both the far-left political party die linke and the right-wing bavarian parliamentarian peter gauweiler , as well as group of professors , argued the lisbon treaty would allow eu leaders to circumvent national parliaments and push decisions through in brussels instead . die linke issued a statement on its website following the court 's announcement saying it too was encouraged by the decision .
the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .
" the -lrb- court 's -rrb- judgment is a double success , " kuenast said .
" it is a clear ‘ yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the rightist and leftist plaintiffs have been rejected … and the constitutional court has consciously dealt out more rights to parliamentarians . "
she said the move was a success for parliamentary democracy .
" now the members of the bundestag are in a very strong position as they reformulate the bill accompanying the treaty . " dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , qatar has launched a concrete offer to invest in porsche . the stuttgart-based carmaker on tuesday said it was not going to renew its requests after an earlier bid for 1,75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.46 billion -rrb- had been rejected .
kfw bank told the company it could make a new bid " at any time , " but porsche said in a statement that it " will not take it up on this offer . "
" porsche will now hold talks about alternative financing possibilities , " the statement added .
the company ran up 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- worth of debt in an attempt to take fellow german automaker volkswagen .
porsche currently holds a 51 percent stake in vw but the takeover attempt has strained the luxury car maker beyond its limits .
as the car industry worldwide has been hit hard , porsche faces disaster should its liabilities be called .
qatar fund offers investment the decision to drop the application for a loan from kfw is likely to boost the chances for potential outside investors .
porsche confirmed that a qatar investment fund has offered to invest in the debt-laden company and to buy stock options .
" we have received an offer from qatar for the acquisition of participation and a purchase of options on volkswagen shares , " a porsche spokesman said .
the offer would serve as a basis for further talks , but will have to be examined by the porsche and piech families who own all of the voting rights in porsche , he added .
on monday , porsche firmly rejected an offer from volkswagen to take a 49 percent stake in the company .

sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .
different take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke says lisbon would undercut german sovereignty the case against the treaty was brought by an unlikely coalition of plaintiffs . both the far-left political party die linke and the right-wing bavarian parliamentarian peter gauweiler , as well as group of professors , argued the lisbon treaty would allow eu leaders to circumvent national parliaments and push decisions through in brussels instead . die linke issued a statement on its website following the court 's announcement saying it too was encouraged by the decision .
the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .
" the -lrb- court 's -rrb- judgment is a double success , " kuenast said .
" it is a clear ‘ yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the rightist and leftist plaintiffs have been rejected … and the constitutional court has consciously dealt out more rights to parliamentarians . "
she said the move was a success for parliamentary democracy .
" now the members of the bundestag are in a very strong position as they reformulate the bill accompanying the treaty . " dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the improvement could give a slight boost to german chancellor angela merkel 's reelection bid . german unemployment for june sank slightly on figures for the previous month , retreating by 48,000 to 3.410 million , according to the federal labor agency figures .
that represents a drop of 0.1 percent , to a seasonally adjusted jobless rate of 8.1 percent .
the figures had been the source of fevered speculation prior to their release , as germany prepares for general elections in september .
a rise in unemployment could have boded ill for chancellor merkel and her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
government-subsidized short-term work contracts have so far helped companies steer clear of mass layoffs despite weakening export markets and declining consumer confidence at home .
the slight fall in german unemployment reinforces recent economic sentiment surveys pointing to expectations of a turnaround in both the european and the german economies as the year progresses .
experts have , however warned that unemployment figures could top 4.1 million by the end of 2009 , if the german economy follows predictions and contracts by more than 6 percent this year .

this would match a further 25 million euro loan granted by the two german states of saxony and bavaria . the funds would be used to finance quelle 's day-to-day operations during insolvency until december 31 .
quelle , the keystone of parent company arcandor 's web of mail-order and online vendors in 28 nations , declared insolvency on june 9 . quelle is a highly symbolic german company , especially among the older generation , and has a mail-order catalogue featuring everything from washing machines to underwear . together with the department store chain karstadt , it is one of the most prominent casualties of the bankruptcy of its parent company arcandor . bailout critics henning koopmann , the boss of quelle 's competitor neckermann , said any state rescue for his rival would be " unfair . " " a state-backed loan might save 8,000 jobs at quelle for now , but it would also endanger the 72,000 jobs at other mail-order companies in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mail order company quelle has a long history in germany bavaria 's opposition social democrats also criticized the regional government , accusing it of conducting a cynical drama on the backs of quelle employees . on saturday , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that quelle transferred all of its cash to its parent arcandor , only hours before the company declared insolvency in june . an arcandor spokesperson later confirmed the report , but said the transfers were automated and not motivated by the insolvency . since then , quelle has been surviving off the kindness of its suppliers , who have suspended their invoices . dfm / nk / nw / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 30.06.2009 russia sends gambling into exile großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's casinos will close their doors on july 1st when a new ban comes in .
russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "

but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .

the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .

the improvement could give a slight boost to german chancellor angela merkel 's reelection bid . german unemployment for june sank slightly on figures for the previous month , retreating by 48,000 to 3.410 million , according to the federal labor agency figures .
that represents a drop of 0.1 percent , to a seasonally adjusted jobless rate of 8.1 percent .
the figures had been the source of fevered speculation prior to their release , as germany prepares for general elections in september .
a rise in unemployment could have boded ill for chancellor merkel and her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
government-subsidized short-term work contracts have so far helped companies steer clear of mass layoffs despite weakening export markets and declining consumer confidence at home .
the slight fall in german unemployment reinforces recent economic sentiment surveys pointing to expectations of a turnaround in both the european and the german economies as the year progresses .
experts have , however warned that unemployment figures could top 4.1 million by the end of 2009 , if the german economy follows predictions and contracts by more than 6 percent this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 30.06.2009 russia sends gambling into exile großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's casinos will close their doors on july 1st when a new ban comes in .
russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

the improvement could give a slight boost to german chancellor angela merkel 's reelection bid . german unemployment for june sank slightly on figures for the previous month , retreating by 48,000 to 3.410 million , according to the federal labor agency figures .
that represents a drop of 0.1 percent , to a seasonally adjusted jobless rate of 8.1 percent .
the figures had been the source of fevered speculation prior to their release , as germany prepares for general elections in september .
a rise in unemployment could have boded ill for chancellor merkel and her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
government-subsidized short-term work contracts have so far helped companies steer clear of mass layoffs despite weakening export markets and declining consumer confidence at home .
the slight fall in german unemployment reinforces recent economic sentiment surveys pointing to expectations of a turnaround in both the european and the german economies as the year progresses .
experts have , however warned that unemployment figures could top 4.1 million by the end of 2009 , if the german economy follows predictions and contracts by more than 6 percent this year .

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 30.06.2009 russia sends gambling into exile großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's casinos will close their doors on july 1st when a new ban comes in .
russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .

but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?

meanwhile , qatar has launched a concrete offer to invest in porsche . the stuttgart-based carmaker on tuesday said it was not going to renew its requests after an earlier bid for 1,75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.46 billion -rrb- had been rejected .
kfw bank told the company it could make a new bid " at any time , " but porsche said in a statement that it " will not take it up on this offer . "
" porsche will now hold talks about alternative financing possibilities , " the statement added .
the company ran up 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- worth of debt in an attempt to take fellow german automaker volkswagen .
porsche currently holds a 51 percent stake in vw but the takeover attempt has strained the luxury car maker beyond its limits .
as the car industry worldwide has been hit hard , porsche faces disaster should its liabilities be called .
qatar fund offers investment the decision to drop the application for a loan from kfw is likely to boost the chances for potential outside investors .
porsche confirmed that a qatar investment fund has offered to invest in the debt-laden company and to buy stock options .
" we have received an offer from qatar for the acquisition of participation and a purchase of options on volkswagen shares , " a porsche spokesman said .
the offer would serve as a basis for further talks , but will have to be examined by the porsche and piech families who own all of the voting rights in porsche , he added .
on monday , porsche firmly rejected an offer from volkswagen to take a 49 percent stake in the company .
porsche and volkswagen have been arguing for weeks over who will have control after a merger , planned last year when porsche was enjoying a boom in sales , goes through. ai / ap / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

delegates are to sign a non-binding declaration in the czech republic on tuesday . " a major accomplishment " was how stuart eizenstat , head of the american delegation to the prague holocaust assets conference , described the outcome of the five-day event . it was the last event of the six-month czech eu presidency , and one clearly designed to make a major impact .
delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .

" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .
some critics believe such meetings are good on words ; creating action to match those words is far more difficult . author : rob cameron editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .
different take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke says lisbon would undercut german sovereignty the case against the treaty was brought by an unlikely coalition of plaintiffs . both the far-left political party die linke and the right-wing bavarian parliamentarian peter gauweiler , as well as group of professors , argued the lisbon treaty would allow eu leaders to circumvent national parliaments and push decisions through in brussels instead . die linke issued a statement on its website following the court 's announcement saying it too was encouraged by the decision .
the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .
" the -lrb- court 's -rrb- judgment is a double success , " kuenast said .
" it is a clear ‘ yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the rightist and leftist plaintiffs have been rejected … and the constitutional court has consciously dealt out more rights to parliamentarians . "
she said the move was a success for parliamentary democracy .

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .

porsche confirmed that a qatar investment fund has offered to invest in the debt-laden company and to buy stock options .
" we have received an offer from qatar for the acquisition of participation and a purchase of options on volkswagen shares , " a porsche spokesman said .
the offer would serve as a basis for further talks , but will have to be examined by the porsche and piech families who own all of the voting rights in porsche , he added .
on monday , porsche firmly rejected an offer from volkswagen to take a 49 percent stake in the company .

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

however , operations at the fuerth-based firm will only be secured until the end of the year . berlin officials said late on monday that the federal government would instruct its kfw bank to extend a loan of 25 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- to quelle , one of europe 's biggest mail-order companies .
this would match a further 25 million euro loan granted by the two german states of saxony and bavaria . the funds would be used to finance quelle 's day-to-day operations during insolvency until december 31 .
quelle , the keystone of parent company arcandor 's web of mail-order and online vendors in 28 nations , declared insolvency on june 9 . quelle is a highly symbolic german company , especially among the older generation , and has a mail-order catalogue featuring everything from washing machines to underwear . together with the department store chain karstadt , it is one of the most prominent casualties of the bankruptcy of its parent company arcandor . bailout critics henning koopmann , the boss of quelle 's competitor neckermann , said any state rescue for his rival would be " unfair . " " a state-backed loan might save 8,000 jobs at quelle for now , but it would also endanger the 72,000 jobs at other mail-order companies in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mail order company quelle has a long history in germany bavaria 's opposition social democrats also criticized the regional government , accusing it of conducting a cynical drama on the backs of quelle employees . on saturday , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that quelle transferred all of its cash to its parent arcandor , only hours before the company declared insolvency in june . an arcandor spokesperson later confirmed the report , but said the transfers were automated and not motivated by the insolvency . since then , quelle has been surviving off the kindness of its suppliers , who have suspended their invoices . dfm / nk / nw / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the improvement could give a slight boost to german chancellor angela merkel 's reelection bid . german unemployment for june sank slightly on figures for the previous month , retreating by 48,000 to 3.410 million , according to the federal labor agency figures .

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .
different take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke says lisbon would undercut german sovereignty the case against the treaty was brought by an unlikely coalition of plaintiffs . both the far-left political party die linke and the right-wing bavarian parliamentarian peter gauweiler , as well as group of professors , argued the lisbon treaty would allow eu leaders to circumvent national parliaments and push decisions through in brussels instead . die linke issued a statement on its website following the court 's announcement saying it too was encouraged by the decision .
the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 30.06.2009 baltics expect no miracles , but small steps from swedish eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallin once called the baltic silicon valley is struggling with high unemployment no region in europe has been hit harder by the financial crisis than the baltics .
but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

however , operations at the fuerth-based firm will only be secured until the end of the year . berlin officials said late on monday that the federal government would instruct its kfw bank to extend a loan of 25 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- to quelle , one of europe 's biggest mail-order companies .
this would match a further 25 million euro loan granted by the two german states of saxony and bavaria . the funds would be used to finance quelle 's day-to-day operations during insolvency until december 31 .
quelle , the keystone of parent company arcandor 's web of mail-order and online vendors in 28 nations , declared insolvency on june 9 . quelle is a highly symbolic german company , especially among the older generation , and has a mail-order catalogue featuring everything from washing machines to underwear . together with the department store chain karstadt , it is one of the most prominent casualties of the bankruptcy of its parent company arcandor . bailout critics henning koopmann , the boss of quelle 's competitor neckermann , said any state rescue for his rival would be " unfair . " " a state-backed loan might save 8,000 jobs at quelle for now , but it would also endanger the 72,000 jobs at other mail-order companies in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mail order company quelle has a long history in germany bavaria 's opposition social democrats also criticized the regional government , accusing it of conducting a cynical drama on the backs of quelle employees . on saturday , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that quelle transferred all of its cash to its parent arcandor , only hours before the company declared insolvency in june . an arcandor spokesperson later confirmed the report , but said the transfers were automated and not motivated by the insolvency . since then , quelle has been surviving off the kindness of its suppliers , who have suspended their invoices . dfm / nk / nw / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .

meanwhile , qatar has launched a concrete offer to invest in porsche . the stuttgart-based carmaker on tuesday said it was not going to renew its requests after an earlier bid for 1,75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.46 billion -rrb- had been rejected .
kfw bank told the company it could make a new bid " at any time , " but porsche said in a statement that it " will not take it up on this offer . "
" porsche will now hold talks about alternative financing possibilities , " the statement added .
the company ran up 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- worth of debt in an attempt to take fellow german automaker volkswagen .
porsche currently holds a 51 percent stake in vw but the takeover attempt has strained the luxury car maker beyond its limits .
as the car industry worldwide has been hit hard , porsche faces disaster should its liabilities be called .
qatar fund offers investment the decision to drop the application for a loan from kfw is likely to boost the chances for potential outside investors .
porsche confirmed that a qatar investment fund has offered to invest in the debt-laden company and to buy stock options .
" we have received an offer from qatar for the acquisition of participation and a purchase of options on volkswagen shares , " a porsche spokesman said .
the offer would serve as a basis for further talks , but will have to be examined by the porsche and piech families who own all of the voting rights in porsche , he added .
on monday , porsche firmly rejected an offer from volkswagen to take a 49 percent stake in the company .

the improvement could give a slight boost to german chancellor angela merkel 's reelection bid . german unemployment for june sank slightly on figures for the previous month , retreating by 48,000 to 3.410 million , according to the federal labor agency figures .
that represents a drop of 0.1 percent , to a seasonally adjusted jobless rate of 8.1 percent .
the figures had been the source of fevered speculation prior to their release , as germany prepares for general elections in september .
a rise in unemployment could have boded ill for chancellor merkel and her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
government-subsidized short-term work contracts have so far helped companies steer clear of mass layoffs despite weakening export markets and declining consumer confidence at home .
the slight fall in german unemployment reinforces recent economic sentiment surveys pointing to expectations of a turnaround in both the european and the german economies as the year progresses .
experts have , however warned that unemployment figures could top 4.1 million by the end of 2009 , if the german economy follows predictions and contracts by more than 6 percent this year .

sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.06.2009 sweden set to take over eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll be seeing more of this in the next six months : the swedish presidency 's logo .
sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

however , operations at the fuerth-based firm will only be secured until the end of the year . berlin officials said late on monday that the federal government would instruct its kfw bank to extend a loan of 25 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- to quelle , one of europe 's biggest mail-order companies .
this would match a further 25 million euro loan granted by the two german states of saxony and bavaria . the funds would be used to finance quelle 's day-to-day operations during insolvency until december 31 .
quelle , the keystone of parent company arcandor 's web of mail-order and online vendors in 28 nations , declared insolvency on june 9 . quelle is a highly symbolic german company , especially among the older generation , and has a mail-order catalogue featuring everything from washing machines to underwear . together with the department store chain karstadt , it is one of the most prominent casualties of the bankruptcy of its parent company arcandor . bailout critics henning koopmann , the boss of quelle 's competitor neckermann , said any state rescue for his rival would be " unfair . " " a state-backed loan might save 8,000 jobs at quelle for now , but it would also endanger the 72,000 jobs at other mail-order companies in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mail order company quelle has a long history in germany bavaria 's opposition social democrats also criticized the regional government , accusing it of conducting a cynical drama on the backs of quelle employees . on saturday , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that quelle transferred all of its cash to its parent arcandor , only hours before the company declared insolvency in june . an arcandor spokesperson later confirmed the report , but said the transfers were automated and not motivated by the insolvency . since then , quelle has been surviving off the kindness of its suppliers , who have suspended their invoices . dfm / nk / nw / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 30.06.2009 holocaust assets conference pledges action on returning nazi loot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took six decades to return this painting to its rightful owners forty-six countries have vowed to increase efforts to return art and property stolen from jews during the holocaust .
delegates are to sign a non-binding declaration in the czech republic on tuesday . " a major accomplishment " was how stuart eizenstat , head of the american delegation to the prague holocaust assets conference , described the outcome of the five-day event . it was the last event of the six-month czech eu presidency , and one clearly designed to make a major impact .
delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .
some critics believe such meetings are good on words ; creating action to match those words is far more difficult . author : rob cameron editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 30.06.2009 baltics expect no miracles , but small steps from swedish eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallin once called the baltic silicon valley is struggling with high unemployment no region in europe has been hit harder by the financial crisis than the baltics .
but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

delegates are to sign a non-binding declaration in the czech republic on tuesday . " a major accomplishment " was how stuart eizenstat , head of the american delegation to the prague holocaust assets conference , described the outcome of the five-day event . it was the last event of the six-month czech eu presidency , and one clearly designed to make a major impact .
delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .
some critics believe such meetings are good on words ; creating action to match those words is far more difficult . author : rob cameron editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .

the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now .

the improvement could give a slight boost to german chancellor angela merkel 's reelection bid . german unemployment for june sank slightly on figures for the previous month , retreating by 48,000 to 3.410 million , according to the federal labor agency figures .
that represents a drop of 0.1 percent , to a seasonally adjusted jobless rate of 8.1 percent .
the figures had been the source of fevered speculation prior to their release , as germany prepares for general elections in september .
a rise in unemployment could have boded ill for chancellor merkel and her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
government-subsidized short-term work contracts have so far helped companies steer clear of mass layoffs despite weakening export markets and declining consumer confidence at home .
the slight fall in german unemployment reinforces recent economic sentiment surveys pointing to expectations of a turnaround in both the european and the german economies as the year progresses .
experts have , however warned that unemployment figures could top 4.1 million by the end of 2009 , if the german economy follows predictions and contracts by more than 6 percent this year .
there are global concerns that the economic crisis could manifest itself as a jobs crisis by year 's end. ch / reuters / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

delegates are to sign a non-binding declaration in the czech republic on tuesday . " a major accomplishment " was how stuart eizenstat , head of the american delegation to the prague holocaust assets conference , described the outcome of the five-day event . it was the last event of the six-month czech eu presidency , and one clearly designed to make a major impact .
delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

the improvement could give a slight boost to german chancellor angela merkel 's reelection bid . german unemployment for june sank slightly on figures for the previous month , retreating by 48,000 to 3.410 million , according to the federal labor agency figures .
that represents a drop of 0.1 percent , to a seasonally adjusted jobless rate of 8.1 percent .
the figures had been the source of fevered speculation prior to their release , as germany prepares for general elections in september .
a rise in unemployment could have boded ill for chancellor merkel and her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
government-subsidized short-term work contracts have so far helped companies steer clear of mass layoffs despite weakening export markets and declining consumer confidence at home .
the slight fall in german unemployment reinforces recent economic sentiment surveys pointing to expectations of a turnaround in both the european and the german economies as the year progresses .
experts have , however warned that unemployment figures could top 4.1 million by the end of 2009 , if the german economy follows predictions and contracts by more than 6 percent this year .
there are global concerns that the economic crisis could manifest itself as a jobs crisis by year 's end. ch / reuters / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 30.06.2009 russia sends gambling into exile großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's casinos will close their doors on july 1st when a new ban comes in .
russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .
different take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke says lisbon would undercut german sovereignty the case against the treaty was brought by an unlikely coalition of plaintiffs . both the far-left political party die linke and the right-wing bavarian parliamentarian peter gauweiler , as well as group of professors , argued the lisbon treaty would allow eu leaders to circumvent national parliaments and push decisions through in brussels instead . die linke issued a statement on its website following the court 's announcement saying it too was encouraged by the decision .
the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .
" the -lrb- court 's -rrb- judgment is a double success , " kuenast said .
" it is a clear ‘ yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the rightist and leftist plaintiffs have been rejected … and the constitutional court has consciously dealt out more rights to parliamentarians . "
she said the move was a success for parliamentary democracy .
" now the members of the bundestag are in a very strong position as they reformulate the bill accompanying the treaty . " dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .
different take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke says lisbon would undercut german sovereignty the case against the treaty was brought by an unlikely coalition of plaintiffs . both the far-left political party die linke and the right-wing bavarian parliamentarian peter gauweiler , as well as group of professors , argued the lisbon treaty would allow eu leaders to circumvent national parliaments and push decisions through in brussels instead . die linke issued a statement on its website following the court 's announcement saying it too was encouraged by the decision .
the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .
" the -lrb- court 's -rrb- judgment is a double success , " kuenast said .
" it is a clear ‘ yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the rightist and leftist plaintiffs have been rejected … and the constitutional court has consciously dealt out more rights to parliamentarians . "
she said the move was a success for parliamentary democracy .

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 30.06.2009 russia sends gambling into exile großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's casinos will close their doors on july 1st when a new ban comes in .
russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

dw-world.de germany to ban online gambling germany is set to prohibit online gambling starting on jan .

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 30.06.2009 baltics expect no miracles , but small steps from swedish eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallin once called the baltic silicon valley is struggling with high unemployment no region in europe has been hit harder by the financial crisis than the baltics .
but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

delegates are to sign a non-binding declaration in the czech republic on tuesday . " a major accomplishment " was how stuart eizenstat , head of the american delegation to the prague holocaust assets conference , described the outcome of the five-day event . it was the last event of the six-month czech eu presidency , and one clearly designed to make a major impact .
delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .

delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .

however , operations at the fuerth-based firm will only be secured until the end of the year . berlin officials said late on monday that the federal government would instruct its kfw bank to extend a loan of 25 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- to quelle , one of europe 's biggest mail-order companies .
this would match a further 25 million euro loan granted by the two german states of saxony and bavaria . the funds would be used to finance quelle 's day-to-day operations during insolvency until december 31 .
quelle , the keystone of parent company arcandor 's web of mail-order and online vendors in 28 nations , declared insolvency on june 9 . quelle is a highly symbolic german company , especially among the older generation , and has a mail-order catalogue featuring everything from washing machines to underwear . together with the department store chain karstadt , it is one of the most prominent casualties of the bankruptcy of its parent company arcandor . bailout critics henning koopmann , the boss of quelle 's competitor neckermann , said any state rescue for his rival would be " unfair . " " a state-backed loan might save 8,000 jobs at quelle for now , but it would also endanger the 72,000 jobs at other mail-order companies in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mail order company quelle has a long history in germany bavaria 's opposition social democrats also criticized the regional government , accusing it of conducting a cynical drama on the backs of quelle employees . on saturday , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that quelle transferred all of its cash to its parent arcandor , only hours before the company declared insolvency in june . an arcandor spokesperson later confirmed the report , but said the transfers were automated and not motivated by the insolvency . since then , quelle has been surviving off the kindness of its suppliers , who have suspended their invoices . dfm / nk / nw / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .
different take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke says lisbon would undercut german sovereignty the case against the treaty was brought by an unlikely coalition of plaintiffs . both the far-left political party die linke and the right-wing bavarian parliamentarian peter gauweiler , as well as group of professors , argued the lisbon treaty would allow eu leaders to circumvent national parliaments and push decisions through in brussels instead . die linke issued a statement on its website following the court 's announcement saying it too was encouraged by the decision .
the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .
" the -lrb- court 's -rrb- judgment is a double success , " kuenast said .
" it is a clear ‘ yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the rightist and leftist plaintiffs have been rejected … and the constitutional court has consciously dealt out more rights to parliamentarians . "
she said the move was a success for parliamentary democracy .
" now the members of the bundestag are in a very strong position as they reformulate the bill accompanying the treaty . " dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 30.06.2009 baltics expect no miracles , but small steps from swedish eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallin once called the baltic silicon valley is struggling with high unemployment no region in europe has been hit harder by the financial crisis than the baltics .
but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.06.2009 german leaders hail court 's green light for eu reform treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon treaty has moved a step closer to ratification a ruling by germany ’ s highest court that the eu ’ s reforming lisbon treaty is compatible with german basic law has been received in germany and europe as an encouraging step forward . the court rejected complaints from germany 's far-left party and a maverick conservative member of parliament that the treaty would transfer too much power to brussels . it said the reforms were fundamentally in line with the country 's constitution , but it set conditions .
that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .
different take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke says lisbon would undercut german sovereignty the case against the treaty was brought by an unlikely coalition of plaintiffs . both the far-left political party die linke and the right-wing bavarian parliamentarian peter gauweiler , as well as group of professors , argued the lisbon treaty would allow eu leaders to circumvent national parliaments and push decisions through in brussels instead . die linke issued a statement on its website following the court 's announcement saying it too was encouraged by the decision .
the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .
" the -lrb- court 's -rrb- judgment is a double success , " kuenast said .
" it is a clear ‘ yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the rightist and leftist plaintiffs have been rejected … and the constitutional court has consciously dealt out more rights to parliamentarians . "
she said the move was a success for parliamentary democracy .
" now the members of the bundestag are in a very strong position as they reformulate the bill accompanying the treaty . " dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .

but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .

delegates are to sign a non-binding declaration in the czech republic on tuesday . " a major accomplishment " was how stuart eizenstat , head of the american delegation to the prague holocaust assets conference , described the outcome of the five-day event . it was the last event of the six-month czech eu presidency , and one clearly designed to make a major impact .
delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .

delegates are to sign a non-binding declaration in the czech republic on tuesday . " a major accomplishment " was how stuart eizenstat , head of the american delegation to the prague holocaust assets conference , described the outcome of the five-day event . it was the last event of the six-month czech eu presidency , and one clearly designed to make a major impact .
delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .

delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .
some critics believe such meetings are good on words ; creating action to match those words is far more difficult . author : rob cameron editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .

the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now .

eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .
different take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke says lisbon would undercut german sovereignty the case against the treaty was brought by an unlikely coalition of plaintiffs . both the far-left political party die linke and the right-wing bavarian parliamentarian peter gauweiler , as well as group of professors , argued the lisbon treaty would allow eu leaders to circumvent national parliaments and push decisions through in brussels instead . die linke issued a statement on its website following the court 's announcement saying it too was encouraged by the decision .
the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .
" the -lrb- court 's -rrb- judgment is a double success , " kuenast said .
" it is a clear ‘ yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the rightist and leftist plaintiffs have been rejected … and the constitutional court has consciously dealt out more rights to parliamentarians . "
she said the move was a success for parliamentary democracy .
" now the members of the bundestag are in a very strong position as they reformulate the bill accompanying the treaty . " dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 30.06.2009 baltics expect no miracles , but small steps from swedish eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallin once called the baltic silicon valley is struggling with high unemployment no region in europe has been hit harder by the financial crisis than the baltics .
but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .
different take bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke says lisbon would undercut german sovereignty the case against the treaty was brought by an unlikely coalition of plaintiffs . both the far-left political party die linke and the right-wing bavarian parliamentarian peter gauweiler , as well as group of professors , argued the lisbon treaty would allow eu leaders to circumvent national parliaments and push decisions through in brussels instead . die linke issued a statement on its website following the court 's announcement saying it too was encouraged by the decision .
the party said the fact that the ratification process had been " stopped was a sign of how seriously the bundestag 's right to participation would be hindered by the lisbon treaty . "
they interpreted the decision as a " resounding box on the ears of the cdu , csu , spd , fdp and the greens . "
die linke said " the judgement strengthens parliamentary possibilities for correcting the market-radical , antisocial and militaristic lisbon treaty … the treaty therefore must be more social and democratic . "
gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .
" the -lrb- court 's -rrb- judgment is a double success , " kuenast said .
" it is a clear ‘ yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the rightist and leftist plaintiffs have been rejected … and the constitutional court has consciously dealt out more rights to parliamentarians . "

that led christian democrat chancellor angela merkel to hail the ruling as a " good day for the lisbon treaty . "
" the important message of the day is that the lisbon treaty has cleared another significant hurdle .
i am very pleased about that , " merkel told reporters in berlin after the judgement .
the german president , horst koehler , has waited for the court decision before signing the bill ratifying the treaty . the court has now required parliament to change that bill to ensure that german constitutional provisions are respected .
it said the law must make clear that the upper and lower houses of parliament have a role to play in shaping decisions taken in brussels .
the german parliament , the bundestag , will hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified , said a spokeswoman for the centre-left social democrats , part of the governing coalition .
merkel said the ruling parties planned to agree on the required changes before the september 27 federal election .
good signs for lisbon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says the treaty should be passed this year social democrat foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was also satisfied with the court 's decision .
" the clarity with which the constitutional court has decided that lisbon is completely compatible with the basic law is pleasing , " he said tuesday .
" i 'm sure the treaty will be ratified this year . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso also welcomed the ruling , saying he was " confident we can complete the process of ratification of the treaty of lisbon in all countries by the autumn . "
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
irish voters rejected the treaty last year over fears it could affect the country 's policies on neutrality and abortion .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted .

gauweiler , who sits in the bundestag for the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the christian democrats , said the court had gone further than he expected , strengthening the rights of the bundestag to have the final say on whether european law applies in germany . he told the online edition of spiegel news magazine , " what karlsruhe has laid down is something very different from the way eu issues have been nodded through until now . "
meanwhile , renate kuenast , the head of the greens parliamentary group , welcomed the temporary halt in the ratification process of the eu reform treaty .
" the -lrb- court 's -rrb- judgment is a double success , " kuenast said .
" it is a clear ‘ yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the rightist and leftist plaintiffs have been rejected … and the constitutional court has consciously dealt out more rights to parliamentarians . "
she said the move was a success for parliamentary democracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.06.2009 sweden set to take over eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 'll be seeing more of this in the next six months : the swedish presidency 's logo .
sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

delegates are to sign a non-binding declaration in the czech republic on tuesday . " a major accomplishment " was how stuart eizenstat , head of the american delegation to the prague holocaust assets conference , described the outcome of the five-day event . it was the last event of the six-month czech eu presidency , and one clearly designed to make a major impact .
delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .
some critics believe such meetings are good on words ; creating action to match those words is far more difficult . author : rob cameron editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

delegates are to sign a non-binding declaration in the czech republic on tuesday . " a major accomplishment " was how stuart eizenstat , head of the american delegation to the prague holocaust assets conference , described the outcome of the five-day event . it was the last event of the six-month czech eu presidency , and one clearly designed to make a major impact .
delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .

looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .

the train , which was filled with liquefied gas , reportedly derailed . hundreds of firefighters from across the region were rushed to the area to dig through the rubble of collapsed and burning homes .
a spokesman for the firefighters said the death toll stood at 13 by tuesday morning but warned that the number of victims might rise as the rescue teams searched through the rubble .
about a thousand people were evacuated just after the blast around midnight shocked people from their beds near the train station in the tuscan seaside town about 350 kilometers -lrb- 220 miles -rrb- north of rome . state railways said the accident occurred when one carriage derailed , pulling another four with it .
liquefied petroleum gas then leaked from a tank on one of the carriages and caught fire .

the improvement could give a slight boost to german chancellor angela merkel 's reelection bid . german unemployment for june sank slightly on figures for the previous month , retreating by 48,000 to 3.410 million , according to the federal labor agency figures .
that represents a drop of 0.1 percent , to a seasonally adjusted jobless rate of 8.1 percent .
the figures had been the source of fevered speculation prior to their release , as germany prepares for general elections in september .
a rise in unemployment could have boded ill for chancellor merkel and her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
government-subsidized short-term work contracts have so far helped companies steer clear of mass layoffs despite weakening export markets and declining consumer confidence at home .
the slight fall in german unemployment reinforces recent economic sentiment surveys pointing to expectations of a turnaround in both the european and the german economies as the year progresses .
experts have , however warned that unemployment figures could top 4.1 million by the end of 2009 , if the german economy follows predictions and contracts by more than 6 percent this year .
there are global concerns that the economic crisis could manifest itself as a jobs crisis by year 's end. ch / reuters / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , operations at the fuerth-based firm will only be secured until the end of the year . berlin officials said late on monday that the federal government would instruct its kfw bank to extend a loan of 25 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- to quelle , one of europe 's biggest mail-order companies .
this would match a further 25 million euro loan granted by the two german states of saxony and bavaria . the funds would be used to finance quelle 's day-to-day operations during insolvency until december 31 .
quelle , the keystone of parent company arcandor 's web of mail-order and online vendors in 28 nations , declared insolvency on june 9 . quelle is a highly symbolic german company , especially among the older generation , and has a mail-order catalogue featuring everything from washing machines to underwear . together with the department store chain karstadt , it is one of the most prominent casualties of the bankruptcy of its parent company arcandor . bailout critics henning koopmann , the boss of quelle 's competitor neckermann , said any state rescue for his rival would be " unfair . " " a state-backed loan might save 8,000 jobs at quelle for now , but it would also endanger the 72,000 jobs at other mail-order companies in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mail order company quelle has a long history in germany bavaria 's opposition social democrats also criticized the regional government , accusing it of conducting a cynical drama on the backs of quelle employees . on saturday , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that quelle transferred all of its cash to its parent arcandor , only hours before the company declared insolvency in june . an arcandor spokesperson later confirmed the report , but said the transfers were automated and not motivated by the insolvency . since then , quelle has been surviving off the kindness of its suppliers , who have suspended their invoices . dfm / nk / nw / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .
in my opinion , the court has requested him to give it back , and he should do so . "
the vase showed up in germany years ago in the catalog of a munich auction house , designated as a mediterranean piece from the roman iron age .
but someone familiar with mesopotamian art spotted it , and sued the auctioneer for breach of the foreign trade law .
stolen objects transit through germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's lax cultural heritage laws blur the line between trading and trafficking antiques as part of the suit , customs officials brought the object to the museum in mainz to have its provenance checked .
mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .
indeed , the case sheds light on germany 's overall role in both antiques trading and antiques trafficking - a distinction that is often hard to make when it comes to the sale of ancient objects , experts say .
' unfortunate ' legal situation germany was the last industrial country to sign a unesco convention on protecting cultural heritage , and its loose demands for documentation on exports of some ancient objects seen as being friendly to fencers and smugglers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .

mueller-karpe said the vase is " most probably " around 4,500 years old , and believes it was stolen by grave robbers from the ancient royal cemetery in the city of ur , iraq .
its provenance may be researched further as the case moves through the courts , said customs official peulen .
international traffic in antiques and artefacts from iraq has bloomed since the fall of saddam hussein .
according to the spiegel online newsmagazine , of the 15,000 pieces that were robbed from the national museum in baghdad in the wake of the us invasion in 2003 , just 6,000 have been returned .
many of the missing objects - and more stolen from grave robbers around ur - make their way through german auction houses at some point on their travels .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller-karpe faces the possibility of a prison sentence in iraq if he returns the vase " the legal situation in germany is very unfortunate for us , " the iraqi culture attache in berlin told spiegel online .
the burden of proof , " especially for objects stolen by grave robbers , " is too high , he said .
" even an expert opinion with a probability of provenance of 95 percent is n't enough for the courts . "
according to mueller-karpe , the two-handled vase - which he believes is a " miniature version " of a sumerian-era vase that would have served a functional purpose - remains in the museum for the time being .
he told dpa news agency that it would be too dangerous for him to give it back to customs authorities , since the iraqis have threatened that anyone who is involved in helping fence stolen goods could face a sentence of up to five years in iraq .
since he is frequently on archaological digs in iraq , mueller-karpe said , the sentence threat means he would lose his opportunity to work .

at its heart is a golden vase just six centimeters high that may or may not have its origins in ancient mesopotamia . the vase is currently being held by michael mueller-karpe , an archaeologist at the roman-germanic central museum in mainz , germany .
three years ago he was charged with providing the court with an expert opinion on the provenance of the object , which is at the center of a lawsuit over fencing illegally trafficked goods .
archaeologist refuses to comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi embassy in berlin says the vase would be less safe back in iraq now mueller-karpe is ignoring a court order , and refuses to turn the vase back over to the customs officials who confiscated it .
the iraqi embassy in berlin has asked him not to , he says .
apparently they believe the object is safer where it is .
the iraqi embassy told deutsche welle , however , that they were making efforts to reclaim the vase .
a " letter of understanding " had recently been signed by both iraqi authorities and the german ambassador to iraq to ensure cooperation in cases where iraqi relics appeared on the german market .
contrary to reports in the german media , the stuttgart customs investigations office is not about to break into the vault at the roman-germanic museum and grab the vase by force .
" i do n't know how that rumor got started , but it 's not true , " said dieter peulen , the acting director of the stuttgart customs investigation office .
he would , however , like to get the object back .
" i 've never seen anything like this before , " said peulen .
" at the moment , -lsb- the vase -rsb- has been confiscated by customs .
-lsb- mueller-karpe -rsb- does n't own it .

however , operations at the fuerth-based firm will only be secured until the end of the year . berlin officials said late on monday that the federal government would instruct its kfw bank to extend a loan of 25 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- to quelle , one of europe 's biggest mail-order companies .
this would match a further 25 million euro loan granted by the two german states of saxony and bavaria . the funds would be used to finance quelle 's day-to-day operations during insolvency until december 31 .
quelle , the keystone of parent company arcandor 's web of mail-order and online vendors in 28 nations , declared insolvency on june 9 . quelle is a highly symbolic german company , especially among the older generation , and has a mail-order catalogue featuring everything from washing machines to underwear . together with the department store chain karstadt , it is one of the most prominent casualties of the bankruptcy of its parent company arcandor . bailout critics henning koopmann , the boss of quelle 's competitor neckermann , said any state rescue for his rival would be " unfair . " " a state-backed loan might save 8,000 jobs at quelle for now , but it would also endanger the 72,000 jobs at other mail-order companies in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mail order company quelle has a long history in germany bavaria 's opposition social democrats also criticized the regional government , accusing it of conducting a cynical drama on the backs of quelle employees . on saturday , the daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that quelle transferred all of its cash to its parent arcandor , only hours before the company declared insolvency in june . an arcandor spokesperson later confirmed the report , but said the transfers were automated and not motivated by the insolvency . since then , quelle has been surviving off the kindness of its suppliers , who have suspended their invoices . dfm / nk / nw / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .

even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de obituary -pipe- 30.06.2009 german dance legend pina bausch dies at 68 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pina bausch put wuppertal on the cultural map acclaimed german dancer and choreographer pina bausch has died at the age of 68 .
the recipient of numerous awards and prizes , she left her mark as an innovator in the hybrid genre of " tanztheater , " or dance theater . the director of the wuppertal tanztheater said tuesday that bausch had passed away unexpectedly earlier that morning .
the choreographer had just last week been diagnosed with cancer , but had continued with her work up until her death . attesting to her global stature , tributes are coming from the world of politics as well as the arts . " unlike almost any other , she broke out of traditional structures in dance , modernized classical ballet and coined her own idiosyncratic style , " said a statement released by german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier . " she was the biggest choreographer in the world , " said paris-based us choreographer carolyn carlson .
" she made a revolution , she was a revolutionary .
she was absolutely unique . " bausch formed the successful wuppertal tanzheater in 1973 , turning the ruhr valley town into an international dance mecca . though bausch tended to avoid the limelight , she became known to many people outside the dance world with her appearance in pedro almodovar 's oscar-winning film " talk to her . "
the film also pays homage to her work . bausch 's oeuvre explores memories , questions of identity and the difficulty of human understanding .
frequently , she thematizes the difficulty of relations between the sexes .
men and women can flirt tenderly at one moment , then fling each other violently across the room the next . " it is about life and about finding a language to describe life , " she said .
the choreographer , on the whole , usually avoided pinning down or labeling her creations , preferring to let her audiences make up their minds . in 2007 she was awarded the kyoto prize - one of the top prizes in the culture and arts field - in recognition of her work in breaking down the boundaries between dance and theater , and pioneering a new direction for theatrical art .
she was the first woman to receive the accolade in the category art and philosophy . breaking with convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bausch 's works leave a vivid visual impression bold and visually arresting , her first works were roundly criticized by traditional ballet fans .
she became notorious for having her company dance on dirt , on leaves , in ankle-deep water , as well as for bringing them into direct contact with the audience . but she began to attract attention abroad with her performances at the world theater festival in nancy , france , in 1977 .
this was the start of a flourishing international career . the grande dame of modern dance was famed for her collaborative way of working .
she would start by directing a barrage of questions at her dancers , who would respond with words , gestures , and improvised dance .
" i 'm not interested in how people move , but what moves them , " she once famously stated . bausch was strongly influenced by kurt jooss , a pioneer of german expressionist dance , with whom she began studying at the age of 14 .
he was to have a strong influence over her work .
the psychological ballets of anthony tudor , whom she encountered during a scholarship at the juilliard school in new york , also made a marked impression on her . although she led her company for over 35 years , she did n't talk of retiring .
upon receiving the kyoto prize less than two years ago , the choreographer said she still had " an awful lot of plans . " jg / kjb / dpa editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews .

the improvement could give a slight boost to german chancellor angela merkel 's reelection bid . german unemployment for june sank slightly on figures for the previous month , retreating by 48,000 to 3.410 million , according to the federal labor agency figures .
that represents a drop of 0.1 percent , to a seasonally adjusted jobless rate of 8.1 percent .
the figures had been the source of fevered speculation prior to their release , as germany prepares for general elections in september .
a rise in unemployment could have boded ill for chancellor merkel and her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
government-subsidized short-term work contracts have so far helped companies steer clear of mass layoffs despite weakening export markets and declining consumer confidence at home .
the slight fall in german unemployment reinforces recent economic sentiment surveys pointing to expectations of a turnaround in both the european and the german economies as the year progresses .
experts have , however warned that unemployment figures could top 4.1 million by the end of 2009 , if the german economy follows predictions and contracts by more than 6 percent this year .

sweden will take over the european union 's rotating presidency on wednesday , after six difficult months of czech leadership .
sweden 's top priorities are climate change and restoring confidence in financial markets . much of brussels will breathe a sigh of relief when sweden is officially handed the european union presidency on wednesday .
the end of the czech presidency marks the end of six months of unhelpful sideline drama , as eu leaders struggled to stave off the worst effects of the economic crisis and dealt with issues such as climate change and the troubled lisbon treaty .
sweden is taking over the job that most eu member states have voted to scrap .
under the lisbon treaty , the six month rotating presidency would be replaced by one president for a two-and-a-half year term .
but the treaty still has a number of stumbling blocks , and in the meantime , sweden has a busy schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly elected european union parliament will take office during sweden 's presidency sweden 's priorities with just nine million people , sweden is home to less than two percent of the population of the entire 27-member european union .
but this small nordic nation has big plans for its six months at the helm .
top of the agenda is the economy .
swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has raised concerns about rising debt levels across europe .
he told reuters news agency that he will be pushing for eu leaders to map out deficit-fighting plans .
" -lrb- the debt -rrb- is not sustainable long-term because it is sending the invoices to future generations , " he said .
sweden says it wants to develop new strategies for economic growth and employment , and says it also wants to establish a european body to supervise stability in the financial system .
road to copenhagen reinfeldt is keen that european leaders do not forget climate change in their bid to save their respective economies .
sweden wants the eu to sign a new un agreement on climate change , which is set to be negotiated in the danish capital copenhagen in december .
the document will replace the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 .
in the lead-up to the united nations conference , sweden will push for unity among the 27 eu members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says sweden 's eu presidency will be open and results-oriented " right now … the ice sheets in greenland and the western antarctic continue to melt and sea levels continue to rise , " reinfeldt has said .
countries " can and must manage the climate and their public finances . "
no threat from home eu politicians can sleep easy in the knowledge that fredrik reinfeldt 's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in the swedish parliament , so there is little chance of his government collapsing , as the czech one did in march .
the swedish opposition has also promised not to quarrel with the ruling party over smaller issues while the government holds the eu presidency .
it 's also unlikely that reinfeldt will make the same kind of political gaffe as former czech prime minister mirek topolanek .
topolanek caused a bit of a sensation in the eu when he said us president barack obama 's economic reforms were the " road to hell . "
reinfeldt has served as prime minister since 2006 and has implemented a number of reforms in sweden , including reducing unemployment benefits and launching a major privatisation program .
he is also apparently a fan of the former swedish pop group abba .

but help for the three countries that went from double-digit growth to double-digit decline is hard to come by . just a few years ago , the baltic countries were considered a european success story .
fifteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 , lithuania , latvia and estonia were labelled the baltic tigers , heralded for their business friendly governments and their highly educated and creative workforce .
perhaps the best symbol of the baltic rags-to-riches story was skype , a company enabling its customers to make international telephone calls for free over the internet .
skype soon attracted a large following and today is a leader in international phone calls .
while its founders , niklas zennström and janus friis are swedish and danish respectively , the company 's technological innovation was masterminded in talinn , the capital of estonia , which the new york times back in 2005 called " a sort of silicon valley on the baltic sea . "
today estonia is reeling from the financial crisis that has crippled its economy .
unemployment trippled within the last year and now hovers around 14 percent ; the economy is expected to contract by more than ten percent .
but compared to its baltic neighbors , estonia is still faring much better .
unemployment in both latvia and lithuania has skyrocketed to 17 percent and latvia especially is on the brink of collapse and could only be saved through a capital injection from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
living in a credit bubble the main reason why the baltics went from boom to boost in less than a decade is easy credit , say analysts .
" our population was never used to credit before and so a lot of the growth was financed through it , be it credit for consumption or credit for construction , " argues jonas cicinskas , an eu expert at vilnius university in lithuania .
the continued double-digit growth rates over a period of seven years triggered a chain reaction , leading first to an increase in wages up to the point where the rise in wages outpaced productivity and then to an increase in inflation , adds cicinskas .
" basically our economy was overheating and we produced more than our potential gross domestic product which is very unusual and could n't be sustained . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers in latvia are protesting drastic cuts by the government hermann bünz , who heads the friedrich ebert foundation in the baltics , a non-profit organisation affiliated with germany 's social democrats , says people have been living in a bubble for the last years .
" they were bombarded with foreign loan and credit offers that had no basis to the economic situation on the ground . "
he recalls that people were even getting credit offers from banks via sms on their mobile phones .
it was just a matter of time until that whole system collapsed like a house of cards , says bünz .
that happened within just a few weeks last year . now the situation is dire , especially in latvia . " the demands made by the imf hit the average people first " , says bünz explaining that monthly pensions were cut by 10 percent , teacher salaries slashed in half and the police pension fund reduced by two-thirds .
" many people do n't know how to survive from one day to the next . "
swedish help some immediate relief for the country should come from 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid the eu agreed upon last week .
in addition , swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country takes over the eu presidency as of july , has urged all member states to recognize the plight of latvians .
so will sweden with its close cultural ties to the baltic states have a special focus on the region during its presidency ?
" yes , says cicinskas , " i would expect more from the swedish eu presidency than of other countries . "
but not just for cultural reasons : " the swedes are most deeply involved in the baltic economy and so they also have financial reasons and responsibility to help out . "
herman bünz disagrees : " i would warn people not to expect much from sweden 's eu presidency .
sweden ca n't do anything alone in the eu , so it would be already very helpful if sweden could start an awareness campaign about the situation in the baltics , but one really should n't expect any miracles from its eu presidency . "
german chancellor angela merkel , for instance , has been reluctant in the past to bail out eastern european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish premier reinfeldt wants to help the baltics , german chancellor merkel has been hesistant about bailouts cicinskas is aware of that and does n't expect miracles either .
he has a simple demand from germany : " europe 's largest country would do us and most other countries the biggest favor , if it gets its economy back on track again very soon . "
he adds that people in the baltic countries in general are accustomed to the brutality of economic forces .
" we have experienced the soviet blockade of our countries in 1991 and we had to deal with the hardships of the switch of the economic system between 1991 and 1993 . "
instead of waiting for miracles from the eu , cicinskas proposes concrete measures that would n't even cost very much .
sweden should convince the eu to set up an extra line of credit for small companies , which suffer especially in the baltics .
in addition , sweden could train young graduates from the baltic states on how to start a company .
perhaps niklas zennström could teach young baltic graduates a lesson about entrepreneurship .
the swedish co-founder of skype sold the company to ebay in 2005 for 2.6 billion dollars and is focused now on his next start-up , joost .

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .
most of the 1,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs .
the gambling development zones are at the far corners of russia 's huge area : in the southern krasnodar region , the baltic exclave of kaliningrad , east siberia 's altai region and the far eastern port of primorye . none of the projected casinos has been built , and an investment of more than 16 billion euro will be needed to realise the project .
critics of the government plan say it is doomed because it will never attract enough investment .
however , lisandro platzer is prepared .
he 's applied for a piece of land in one of the special zones , but as yet he 's not clear about the tax situation , nor are there any solutions to the problem that there is also no electricity or infrastructure in the area .
" for the moment we 'd rather invest our money in some other country , " he said .
" we 've just bough a casino in montenegro , and everything there is ready to go . "
he 's not alone in buying up in montenegro , either .
matchstick poker a big gamble there will be an exception to the new rules : after the ban takes effect poker will be allowed outside the special zones , but only so long as it is played for sport not money .
some experts believe that many casinos will use this as a loophole and , after a phase of restructuring , will open anew .
even so , not every casino sees a future in poker , played for sport .
right now in russia there are ten prestige building projects which have been frozen due to the new law .
“ the mood here is naturally not very good , ” says dmitri the croupier .
“ especially now , in a time of crisis , it 's not going to be easy to find another profession here in russia . ”

russia once sent its political prisoners to the wastelands at the edges of its empire , and is now doing the same with its casinos . from july 1 , the government plans to ban the existing casinos and gambling halls and replace them with las vegas-style gaming zones in four rarely visited regions considered in need of investment , including one near the border with north korea .
the russian capital has around 550 places where you can gamble , including 30 casinos which have become synonymous with moscow 's love of excess ; and which occupy prime spots across the city .
but it 's not just the glitzy casinos in the big cities that are affected .
every roulette table and every grimy slot-machine across russia will be sent into exile .
many fear the move will create massive unemployment .
no more bets , please .
in the moscow casino " korston " , one of the biggest in europe , the ball rolls in the roulette wheel .
" no more bets " , says croupier dmitri menshikov .
he 's still at his roulette table , but when the ban takes effect on the 1st of july , all bets will be off for him and his colleagues .
overall , an estimated 300,000 to half a million employees will lose their jobs .
it 's something dmitri could never have dreamed of when he first stepped behind a roulette wheel six years ago .
" a job in the gambling industry has always been seen as completely crisis-proof , " menshikov says , " even in the big crisis of 1998 , when the ruble and the russian economy collapsed , salaries were still being paid in casinos . "
prime minister vladimir putin came up with this idea back in 2006 when he was president .
he says it 's for the health of the russian people , who he says have become addicted to gambling since the end of communism .
it 's also a way to get investors into areas which desperately need it .
however many analysts and russian journalists are saying the government has pursued this ban because of georgian criminal links to several gaming operations in moscow .
lisandro platzer , vice president of korston , which runs hotels as well as casinos , fears that this new law will send large parts of the gambling industry underground where they 'll continue operating illegally .
" that 's why i do n't understand this law , " platzer says , " why this new law is being introduced so strictly .
law enforcement agencies already have enough to do in the fight against prostitution and drugs , and they 've had little success . "
the gambling halls of korston casino will be turned into a musical and theatre hall , an indoor golf facility and a children 's playground .

delegates are to sign a non-binding declaration in the czech republic on tuesday . " a major accomplishment " was how stuart eizenstat , head of the american delegation to the prague holocaust assets conference , described the outcome of the five-day event . it was the last event of the six-month czech eu presidency , and one clearly designed to make a major impact .
delegates from 46 mainly european countries gathered for the biggest holocaust assets conference since washington in 1998 . they emerged with the terezin declaration - a public pledge to do more to redress one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century – the nazi theft of around 650,000 works of art and also substantial amounts of property from europe 's jews . " -lsb- such declarations -rsb- do not create legal obligations , they are not treaties , but they create important moral obligations , " said eizenstat .
" we are living in the 21st century , in which moral obligations and national reputations can be made or broken by the willingness of countries which sign on to these obligations to assume them . "
as many as 70,000 artworks remain scattered in museums and private collections or simply lost around the world .
there is a feeling that the process has stalled in some countries , thanks to a combination of lack of political will and often sheer ignorance of the provenance of artwork .
european countries lagging behind in a report compiled for the prague conference , the jewish claims conference said only one-third of the 44 countries who agreed to the washington principles had made substantial progress , citing hungary , poland , spain and italy as those that had made no progress at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prague conference also focused on how to teach the holocaust in school " there is some atmosphere , not only in the czech republic but i would say all around the world , literally , it 's more or less a feeling that the authorities , respective authorities , think that the holocaust era assets is a closed chapter , " said tomas kraus , secretary of the federation of czech jewish communities .
" -lsb- some countries believe that -rsb- everything that could have been done was done .
and this is not so , there are still some remaining parts " .
looted art is just part of a wider set of aims set down in prague .
property restitution is also a major issue – there poland has actually been singled out for praise , an indicator that countries are making progress in some areas and lagging behind in others .
the first point on the terezin declaration , however , concerns the well-being of the remaining holocaust survivors . " what we have found is that by our own studies over a third of our holocaust survivors in the richest nation on earth are living at or below the poverty level and that 's unacceptable , " eizenstat said . " by making this a first order of business , hopefully it elevates this to the consciousness of policymakers and governments and the public . " holocaust education essential to monitor progress in all these legacies of the holocaust – the return of looted artwork , the restitution of property stolen by the nazis , access to archives long hidden under dust – the 46 delegates agreed to set up a new institution in terezin – called the european shoah legacy institute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-jewish writer lenka reinerova , who died last year , was honored at the conference terezin was where the nazis once herded jews from all over europe en route to auschwitz and the other death camps of the east .
holocaust education , too , will be a key component of the new institute .
historians believe education is vital in the ongoing battle against intolerance . " there 's a tremendous outburst of anti-semitism which is different from xenophobia and other things ; it 's much more ancient , " said renowned holocaust scholar yehuda bauer .
" -lsb- anti-semitism -rsb- has tremendous roots .
it is not a prejudice , it 's a cultural phenomenon which has been around for thousands of years , which is based on the fact that the jewish civilization is not better or worse but it ’ s different . " there is already , however , some skepticism as to whether the terezin declaration will achieve anything .
critics say the declaration itself is far too vague , and it remains , of course , non-binding . an editorial in the jerusalem post was describing the leaked draft as " toothless " before the ink on the document was even dry .
some critics believe such meetings are good on words ; creating action to match those words is far more difficult . author : rob cameron editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hdtv computer animation maps out portions of the former borders in berlin and between west and east germany in an effort to show what a divided germany was really like .
deutsche welle will be broadcasting the animation worldwide via dw-tv , as well as making it available on dw-world.de. today , remnants of the wall and of the no-man 's land that separated east from west are too few and far between for their meaning to be passed on to future generations .
historians and television producers worked together in this deutsche welle project to create a detailed reconstruction of the no-man 's land from the early 1980s , including new views of the border area .
“ deutsche welle is also responsible for documenting , showing and retracing german history , ” says deutsche welle 's director general erik bettermann . " we want to convey how we suffered in berlin and on the german-german border between the gdr and the federal republic . "
christoph lanz , head of dw-tv , said that the hdtv animation is particularly accessible to younger audiences , for whom a divided germany is just another piece of distant history .
the inner border was never accessible , but thanks to the intensive animation process , the border can be " virtually experienced , " says axel klausmeier , director of the berlin wall foundation – an experience that the 300,000 annual visitors to the bernauer strasse memorial will also benefit from .
to recreate the border in the utmost detail , the animators from art + com in berlin generated 130,000 pictures according to historical models .
it took some 100,000 hours for the computers to calculate the data necessary for the high-definition production .
each individual object had to be copied with so-called polygons – around 500,000 were necessary for the church of reconciliation on bernauer strasse in berlin .
dw-tv will broadcast the animation around the world in german , english , arabic and spanish .
the film will also be available for viewing at the berlin wall foundation memorial in berlin and is also to be shown at the german embassies and consulates as well as at goethe institutes around the world .
deutsche welle will make the computer animation available free of charge to institutions that deal with german history .
the project will also be available for use by the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- and the state ministries for culture and education .

steve walker , chief of the nhs litigation authority , said payouts for compensation claims and lawyer fees could only come from the nhs 's budget .
and the bbc has also learned that a law firm acting for parents in the alder hey organ retention case tried to claim nearly £ 4.5m in costs from the nhs .
lawyers argue costs rise because the nhs takes too long to settle claims .
mr walker said the nhs was facing an increasing number of claims from no win , no fee solicitors arguing these were more attractive propositions for claimant and solicitor .
the rising cost of litigation means the nhs has had to put aside a record £ 787m this year to cover the cost of claims .
last year , solicitors suing the nhs received more than £ 91m in costs - nearly three times as much as solicitors acting for the nhs .
cash diverted mr walker told bbc radio 4 's file on 4 : " the present system means there is too great a drain on public resources largely for the benefit of ... claimant solicitors who are effectively recovering at a rate of perhaps as much as four times what we would pay our solicitors for doing the same quality of work .

law firms can earn substantially more in fees than their clients get in damages .
documents obtained by file on 4 outline the disparities .
in just one of many such cases a successful claimant was awarded £ 5,000 , but their solicitor received £ 56,000 .
another claimant received £ 7,000 , their solicitor over £ 77,000 .
file on 4 has been told that no win , no fee solicitors have charged as much as £ 800 pounds an hour and the programme has seen bills where a law firm charged more than £ 700 because their train was delayed and another charged £ 26 to " consider the arrival of a letter " .
late settlement however medical negligence lawyer russell levy claimed that legal costs can rise because the nhs drags cases out .
" they hope the harder they make it and the more they discourage people , they will go away , " he said .
he claimed the nhs lawyers often left settling cases until they were on the verge of a court hearing .
" by the time they accept the inevitable , it costs much more than it should . "
the nhs is currently facing 6,000 plus medical negligence cases of which half are from no win , no fee solicitors .
if an nhs trust believes a costs claim is excessive it can challenge the costs at a hearing before a costs judge .
alder hey mr walker told file on 4 in one case the nhs decided to fight a claim for £ 4,479,957.06 submitted by liverpool firm e rex makin which had been working on behalf of parents in the alder hey organ retention scandal .
" we told them we would n't be paying and began at considerable expense to prepare for a hearing , " he said .
after two months of negotiation the law firm agreed to accept £ 430,000 settlement .
e rex makin said the submitted bill included all items of work for which its solicitor believed he was entitled to recover payment .
the firm said its bill was never assessed by the court and the negotiated settlement that was reached with the health authority 's solicitors reflected a number of technical arguments that were raised over the costs claimed .

steve walker , chief of the nhs litigation authority , said payouts for compensation claims and lawyer fees could only come from the nhs 's budget .
and the bbc has also learned that a law firm acting for parents in the alder hey organ retention case tried to claim nearly £ 4.5m in costs from the nhs .
lawyers argue costs rise because the nhs takes too long to settle claims .
mr walker said the nhs was facing an increasing number of claims from no win , no fee solicitors arguing these were more attractive propositions for claimant and solicitor .
the rising cost of litigation means the nhs has had to put aside a record £ 787m this year to cover the cost of claims .
last year , solicitors suing the nhs received more than £ 91m in costs - nearly three times as much as solicitors acting for the nhs .
cash diverted mr walker told bbc radio 4 's file on 4 : " the present system means there is too great a drain on public resources largely for the benefit of ... claimant solicitors who are effectively recovering at a rate of perhaps as much as four times what we would pay our solicitors for doing the same quality of work . "

listen on iplayer download the podcast mr walker added , " there is only one source of money for the nhs . we have to pay claims from money that would be spent on patient care . "
law firms can earn substantially more in fees than their clients get in damages .
documents obtained by file on 4 outline the disparities .
in just one of many such cases a successful claimant was awarded £ 5,000 , but their solicitor received £ 56,000 .
another claimant received £ 7,000 , their solicitor over £ 77,000 .
file on 4 has been told that no win , no fee solicitors have charged as much as £ 800 pounds an hour and the programme has seen bills where a law firm charged more than £ 700 because their train was delayed and another charged £ 26 to " consider the arrival of a letter " .
late settlement however medical negligence lawyer russell levy claimed that legal costs can rise because the nhs drags cases out .
" they hope the harder they make it and the more they discourage people , they will go away , " he said .
he claimed the nhs lawyers often left settling cases until they were on the verge of a court hearing .
" by the time they accept the inevitable , it costs much more than it should . "
the nhs is currently facing 6,000 plus medical negligence cases of which half are from no win , no fee solicitors .
if an nhs trust believes a costs claim is excessive it can challenge the costs at a hearing before a costs judge .
alder hey mr walker told file on 4 in one case the nhs decided to fight a claim for £ 4,479,957.06 submitted by liverpool firm e rex makin which had been working on behalf of parents in the alder hey organ retention scandal .
" we told them we would n't be paying and began at considerable expense to prepare for a hearing , " he said .
after two months of negotiation the law firm agreed to accept £ 430,000 settlement .
e rex makin said the submitted bill included all items of work for which its solicitor believed he was entitled to recover payment .
the firm said its bill was never assessed by the court and the negotiated settlement that was reached with the health authority 's solicitors reflected a number of technical arguments that were raised over the costs claimed .
