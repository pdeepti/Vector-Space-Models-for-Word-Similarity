forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communist party aligns itself with europe and moscow the party was once staunchly pro-russian but changed course dramatically in 2005 and today seeks closer ties with the european union as well as good ties with russia , on which it depends for gas and other supplies .
despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .
" under the present circumstances the communists can not stay in power for long , " filat said .
" the time is past when the communists could buy support from opposition ranks ... i can vouch for every member of the opposition personally . " nda / ncy , dpa / afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
he also backed ankara 's eu aspirations and called on the country to patch up relations with armenia . on the final leg of his first overseas trip in turkey , president barack obama has reached out to the muslim world , calling for a greater partnership between islamic nations and the west .
" let me say this as clearly as i can : the united states is not at war with islam , " he said .
" in fact , our partnership with the muslim world is crucial to rolling back a fringe ideology that people of all faiths reject . "
but obama also said he did n't want the struggle against al qaeda to be the defining feature of the relationship .
he praised the muslim faith as one of the defining forces in the modern world and promised to seek broad engagements , based on mutual interests and respect .
" the united states has been enriched by muslim americans , " he said .
" many other americans have muslims in their family or have lived in a muslim-majority country .
i know , because i am one of them . "
turkey a crucial ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama pointed out how important turkey is to the us addressing the turkish parliament , he said that the us would soon launch outreach programs , in a bid to improve damaged relations after george w. bush 's administration .
he described his visit as " a statement about the importance of turkey , not just to the united states , but to the world . "
turkey is a key muslim ally for the united states .
obama said that while the two countries do n't agree on everything , they are stronger when working together .
he also promised to support the country 's bid to become a member of the european union , despite objections from eu member-states like france and germany .
" europe gains by diversity of ethnicity , tradition and faith - it is not diminished by it , " he said .

however , before parliament in ankara he said his views on the matter were n't that important .
" this is really about how the turkish and armenian people deal with the past , " he said .
" and the best way forward for the turkish and armenian people is a process that works through the past in a way that is honest , open and constructive . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 06.04.2009 communists sweep back to power in moldova elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova will likely continue to have europe 's only communist president the pro-european communist party of moldova has won a decisive victory in the ex-soviet republic 's parliamentary elections , with 49.93 percent of the vote , officials said monday . the center-left party headed by president vladimir voronin had captured 49.9 percent of the popular vote with 98 percent of all ballots counted , according to data made public by moldova 's central election commission .
forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communist party aligns itself with europe and moscow the party was once staunchly pro-russian but changed course dramatically in 2005 and today seeks closer ties with the european union as well as good ties with russia , on which it depends for gas and other supplies .
despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .

the jury 's out the un security council has ended an emergency session without agreeing on an immediate response to north korea 's long range rocket launch .
pyongyang hails satellite launch as huge success . a united nations security council emergency session has ended with no immediate action against north korea for its rocket launch .
us president barack obama said north korea 's move was intended as a threat to countries " near and far " and that pyongyang must be forced to change .
china and russia called on all sides for restraint .
both had made clear before the launch that they would use their veto power to block any resolution imposing new sanctions on pyongyang .
un security council members " agreed to continue consultations on the appropriate reaction by the council ... given the urgency of the matter , " mexican u.n. ambassador claude heller , who holds the body 's rotating presidency , told reporters .
us ambassador susan rice and japanese ambassador yukio takasu both called for a clear and firm response and said they wanted to see a fresh resolution .
chinese ambassador zhang yesui said any reaction must be " cautious and proportionate . "
washington and tokyo want a resolution demanding stricter enforcement , and possibly expansion , of an existing arms embargo and financial sanctions .
new sanctions seem unlikely and it was unclear whether moscow and beijing would agree to a tightening of existing sanctions regime , including an arms embargo , against north korea 's communist regime .
pyongyang says that it successfully launched a communications satellite but the us and south korea called the mission a failure because the payload failed to get into orbit .
meanwhile japanese ships continue to comb the area in the pacific ocean where debris from the rocket went down to determine whether the object was a satellite or part of a long-range ballistic missile . nrt / jk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for a lot of people , what is happening is unimaginable , " ackermann said of bonuses payments made to bank managers in the mass-circulation bild newspaper 's monday edition .
" not everything that a person is legally entitled to is also legitimate . " as many of the current economic difficulties plaguing the globe resulted from mismanagement in financial institutions , ackermann said the people responsible for causing the crisis should not be rewarded for their mistakes with bonus payments funded by taxpayers . " when lots of people are suffering from the economic crisis - and lots of people are - then bank managers have to make sacrifices , " he said . public outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers should have to make sacrifices like the rest of the public , according to ackermann ackermann was one of the first bankers in germany to forgo his bonus and saw his annual compensation drop by nearly 90 percent to 1.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.9 million -rrb- in 2008 . the public 's ire has been raised recently by million of euros in bonuses paid to leading executives at dresdner bank .
dresdner was taken over by commerzbank , which has received billions in state aid . in its financial rescue package , the german government put a 500,000-euro limit on salaries for board of director members and said bonuses would not be paid at institutes that receive federal bail-out funds . ackermann said he would be ashamed if deutsche bank , germany 's largest bank , had to rely on a government bail-out in order to stay solvent , but he added that whether a bank accepts state money should not play in a role in top managers ' behavior . " we have to send a signal in the interest of social peace , which is also in our own interests , " ackerman said . just over two years ago , a court dropped charges of breach of fiduciary duty against ackermann for approving huge bonus payments in exchange for a financial settlement of 3.2 million euros . sms / pfd , reuters / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for a lot of people , what is happening is unimaginable , " ackermann said of bonuses payments made to bank managers in the mass-circulation bild newspaper 's monday edition .
" not everything that a person is legally entitled to is also legitimate . " as many of the current economic difficulties plaguing the globe resulted from mismanagement in financial institutions , ackermann said the people responsible for causing the crisis should not be rewarded for their mistakes with bonus payments funded by taxpayers . " when lots of people are suffering from the economic crisis - and lots of people are - then bank managers have to make sacrifices , " he said . public outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers should have to make sacrifices like the rest of the public , according to ackermann ackermann was one of the first bankers in germany to forgo his bonus and saw his annual compensation drop by nearly 90 percent to 1.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.9 million -rrb- in 2008 . the public 's ire has been raised recently by million of euros in bonuses paid to leading executives at dresdner bank .
dresdner was taken over by commerzbank , which has received billions in state aid . in its financial rescue package , the german government put a 500,000-euro limit on salaries for board of director members and said bonuses would not be paid at institutes that receive federal bail-out funds . ackermann said he would be ashamed if deutsche bank , germany 's largest bank , had to rely on a government bail-out in order to stay solvent , but he added that whether a bank accepts state money should not play in a role in top managers ' behavior . " we have to send a signal in the interest of social peace , which is also in our own interests , " ackerman said . just over two years ago , a court dropped charges of breach of fiduciary duty against ackermann for approving huge bonus payments in exchange for a financial settlement of 3.2 million euros . sms / pfd , reuters / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , opel sources scotched the rumor that the arab state was interested in the ailing company . the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- newspaper quoted family member sheikh hamdan indirectly as saying that " no decision has been taken yet . "
sheikh hamdan said that a meeting he had had last week with german regional premier juergen ruettgers of the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to an opel plant , was nonetheless " very positive . "
opel , a unit of distressed us giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- , is looking for private investors to supplement aid sought from the government , and german chancellor angela merkel has indicated she would like to share the burden with others too .
abu dhabi said late last month it would take a 9.1-percent stake in daimler , the german owner of mercedes benz autos and the world 's leading truck maker , for 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.64 billion -rrb- , becoming its biggest shareholder .

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .

the decision opens the way for demjanjuk to stand trial . a stay of deportation would have prevented suspected nazi war criminal john demjanjuk from being extradited to germany .
the ruling by the us immigration court in arlington , virginia , means that demjanjuk can now be deported as early as wednesday , although his lawyers can still seek another stay .
demjanjuk , 89 , had filed a last-minute emergency court motion to stop his deportation , arguing that he was too ill to make the journey to germany and stand trial .
the court 's decision has been welcomed by the world jewish congress based in new york .
president ronald lauder said in a statement that holocaust survivors demand justice .
" demjanjuk may be old and frail , " he said , " but so are many holocaust survivors whose lives were destroyed by the likes of him . "
" no nazi war criminal still alive should feel safe anywhere in the world , " he added .
deportation would be " torture " demjanjuk claimed that his deportation would amount to torture because of his poor health . over the weekend , a german official said his claim was an outrage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions over his identity saved demjanjuk from the death sentence in israel " that is cynical and absolutely intolerable , " said bavarian justice minister beate merk .

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .
president must give final approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has the final say on the new leader klaus said that he would designate whoever secures an absolute majority of 101 votes in the 200-seat lower house , a condition that required cooperation between bitter foes topolanek and paroubek .
analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .
if fischer is confirmed in office it would end speculation among some analysts that klaus might appoint a eurosceptic cabinet that could halt ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty , meant to streamline decision-making in the 27-member bloc . nda / pfd , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communist party aligns itself with europe and moscow the party was once staunchly pro-russian but changed course dramatically in 2005 and today seeks closer ties with the european union as well as good ties with russia , on which it depends for gas and other supplies .
despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .
" under the present circumstances the communists can not stay in power for long , " filat said .
" the time is past when the communists could buy support from opposition ranks ... i can vouch for every member of the opposition personally . " nda / ncy , dpa / afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision opens the way for demjanjuk to stand trial . a stay of deportation would have prevented suspected nazi war criminal john demjanjuk from being extradited to germany .
the ruling by the us immigration court in arlington , virginia , means that demjanjuk can now be deported as early as wednesday , although his lawyers can still seek another stay .
demjanjuk , 89 , had filed a last-minute emergency court motion to stop his deportation , arguing that he was too ill to make the journey to germany and stand trial .
the court 's decision has been welcomed by the world jewish congress based in new york .
president ronald lauder said in a statement that holocaust survivors demand justice .
" demjanjuk may be old and frail , " he said , " but so are many holocaust survivors whose lives were destroyed by the likes of him . "
" no nazi war criminal still alive should feel safe anywhere in the world , " he added .

ukrainian-born demjanjuk , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now stateless , is accused in a german arrest warrant of acting as an accessory to the murder of 29,000 jews at the sobibor death camp in nazi-occupied poland .
demjanjuk has denied any involvement in the deaths .
in 1988 , demjanjuk was sentenced to death by an israeli court for being the guard dubbed " ivan the terrible " at the treblinka death camp .

the decision opens the way for demjanjuk to stand trial . a stay of deportation would have prevented suspected nazi war criminal john demjanjuk from being extradited to germany .
the ruling by the us immigration court in arlington , virginia , means that demjanjuk can now be deported as early as wednesday , although his lawyers can still seek another stay .
demjanjuk , 89 , had filed a last-minute emergency court motion to stop his deportation , arguing that he was too ill to make the journey to germany and stand trial .
the court 's decision has been welcomed by the world jewish congress based in new york .
president ronald lauder said in a statement that holocaust survivors demand justice .
" demjanjuk may be old and frail , " he said , " but so are many holocaust survivors whose lives were destroyed by the likes of him . "
" no nazi war criminal still alive should feel safe anywhere in the world , " he added .
deportation would be " torture " demjanjuk claimed that his deportation would amount to torture because of his poor health . over the weekend , a german official said his claim was an outrage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions over his identity saved demjanjuk from the death sentence in israel " that is cynical and absolutely intolerable , " said bavarian justice minister beate merk .
ukrainian-born demjanjuk , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now stateless , is accused in a german arrest warrant of acting as an accessory to the murder of 29,000 jews at the sobibor death camp in nazi-occupied poland .
demjanjuk has denied any involvement in the deaths .
in 1988 , demjanjuk was sentenced to death by an israeli court for being the guard dubbed " ivan the terrible " at the treblinka death camp .
the israeli supreme court later ruled that demjanjuk was not " ivan , " and he returned to the united states . gb / ca / ncy , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after the season we will review who has worked well and who has n't . " klinsmann , who took over at munich at the start of the season , said he was angry with himself about the team 's performance but added that there was plenty of blame to go around .

dresdner was taken over by commerzbank , which has received billions in state aid . in its financial rescue package , the german government put a 500,000-euro limit on salaries for board of director members and said bonuses would not be paid at institutes that receive federal bail-out funds . ackermann said he would be ashamed if deutsche bank , germany 's largest bank , had to rely on a government bail-out in order to stay solvent , but he added that whether a bank accepts state money should not play in a role in top managers ' behavior . " we have to send a signal in the interest of social peace , which is also in our own interests , " ackerman said . just over two years ago , a court dropped charges of breach of fiduciary duty against ackermann for approving huge bonus payments in exchange for a financial settlement of 3.2 million euros . sms / pfd , reuters / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communist party aligns itself with europe and moscow the party was once staunchly pro-russian but changed course dramatically in 2005 and today seeks closer ties with the european union as well as good ties with russia , on which it depends for gas and other supplies .
despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .
" under the present circumstances the communists can not stay in power for long , " filat said .

forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communist party aligns itself with europe and moscow the party was once staunchly pro-russian but changed course dramatically in 2005 and today seeks closer ties with the european union as well as good ties with russia , on which it depends for gas and other supplies .
despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .
" under the present circumstances the communists can not stay in power for long , " filat said .
" the time is past when the communists could buy support from opposition ranks ... i can vouch for every member of the opposition personally . " nda / ncy , dpa / afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communist party aligns itself with europe and moscow the party was once staunchly pro-russian but changed course dramatically in 2005 and today seeks closer ties with the european union as well as good ties with russia , on which it depends for gas and other supplies .
despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .
" under the present circumstances the communists can not stay in power for long , " filat said .
" the time is past when the communists could buy support from opposition ranks ... i can vouch for every member of the opposition personally . " nda / ncy , dpa / afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel said . " for me our aim remains clear , against which our success will be measured , that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries .

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .
president must give final approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has the final say on the new leader klaus said that he would designate whoever secures an absolute majority of 101 votes in the 200-seat lower house , a condition that required cooperation between bitter foes topolanek and paroubek .
analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .

analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .

frank-michael mros was relieved of his duties with immediate effect , a company statement said on monday .
mros will be replaced by juergen kisseberth , a long-time lidl insider .
documents found recently in a dumpster in the ruhr industrial region indicated that the company had violated data protection laws by compiling information of a private nature on staff members in 2008 and 2009 .
comments like " operated on for a tumor " or " wants to get pregnant " were noted in files titled " state of health . "
it is not known if these practices were conducted across the entire lidl organization .
the supermarket chain , which employs some 53,000 people in germany alone and has nearly 4,000 stores in almost every european country as well as canada and the united states , was rocked last year by a scandal after it hired private detectives to watch employees with hidden cameras .
lidl was found guilty in that affair and fined 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- .
due to the latest revelations , trade unions representing lidl employees have called for a criminal investigation and legal consequences .

a statement said naumov resigned for " health reasons . "
a council of europe report in 2004 blamed naumov for being one of those responsible for the disappearance of political opponents to the lukashenko regime .
naumov and three other belarus officials were banned from travelling to the european union and the united states following the disappearances of several opposition politicians and a journalist between 1999 and 2000 .
all of the eu 's entry restrictions were suspended last year , after belarus released inmates , which the west considered the last of the country 's political prisoners .
last month , the eu decided to extend a suspension of sanctions for nine months , which included the travel ban .
however , to keep up the pressure on president lukashenko , eu ministers decided to prolong other sanctions , including an arms embargo , for another year .
belarus has sought better relations with europe in the wake of the global economic crisis .

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .
president must give final approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has the final say on the new leader klaus said that he would designate whoever secures an absolute majority of 101 votes in the 200-seat lower house , a condition that required cooperation between bitter foes topolanek and paroubek .
analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .
if fischer is confirmed in office it would end speculation among some analysts that klaus might appoint a eurosceptic cabinet that could halt ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty , meant to streamline decision-making in the 27-member bloc . nda / pfd , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel said . " for me our aim remains clear , against which our success will be measured , that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries .

" afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel said . " for me our aim remains clear , against which our success will be measured , that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries .

the jury 's out the un security council has ended an emergency session without agreeing on an immediate response to north korea 's long range rocket launch .
pyongyang hails satellite launch as huge success . a united nations security council emergency session has ended with no immediate action against north korea for its rocket launch .
us president barack obama said north korea 's move was intended as a threat to countries " near and far " and that pyongyang must be forced to change .
china and russia called on all sides for restraint .
both had made clear before the launch that they would use their veto power to block any resolution imposing new sanctions on pyongyang .
un security council members " agreed to continue consultations on the appropriate reaction by the council ... given the urgency of the matter , " mexican u.n. ambassador claude heller , who holds the body 's rotating presidency , told reporters .
us ambassador susan rice and japanese ambassador yukio takasu both called for a clear and firm response and said they wanted to see a fresh resolution .
chinese ambassador zhang yesui said any reaction must be " cautious and proportionate . "
washington and tokyo want a resolution demanding stricter enforcement , and possibly expansion , of an existing arms embargo and financial sanctions .
new sanctions seem unlikely and it was unclear whether moscow and beijing would agree to a tightening of existing sanctions regime , including an arms embargo , against north korea 's communist regime .
pyongyang says that it successfully launched a communications satellite but the us and south korea called the mission a failure because the payload failed to get into orbit .
meanwhile japanese ships continue to comb the area in the pacific ocean where debris from the rocket went down to determine whether the object was a satellite or part of a long-range ballistic missile . nrt / jk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .
president must give final approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has the final say on the new leader klaus said that he would designate whoever secures an absolute majority of 101 votes in the 200-seat lower house , a condition that required cooperation between bitter foes topolanek and paroubek .
analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .
if fischer is confirmed in office it would end speculation among some analysts that klaus might appoint a eurosceptic cabinet that could halt ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty , meant to streamline decision-making in the 27-member bloc . nda / pfd , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel said . " for me our aim remains clear , against which our success will be measured , that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries .

the decision opens the way for demjanjuk to stand trial . a stay of deportation would have prevented suspected nazi war criminal john demjanjuk from being extradited to germany .
the ruling by the us immigration court in arlington , virginia , means that demjanjuk can now be deported as early as wednesday , although his lawyers can still seek another stay .
demjanjuk , 89 , had filed a last-minute emergency court motion to stop his deportation , arguing that he was too ill to make the journey to germany and stand trial .
the court 's decision has been welcomed by the world jewish congress based in new york .
president ronald lauder said in a statement that holocaust survivors demand justice .
" demjanjuk may be old and frail , " he said , " but so are many holocaust survivors whose lives were destroyed by the likes of him . "
" no nazi war criminal still alive should feel safe anywhere in the world , " he added .
deportation would be " torture " demjanjuk claimed that his deportation would amount to torture because of his poor health . over the weekend , a german official said his claim was an outrage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions over his identity saved demjanjuk from the death sentence in israel " that is cynical and absolutely intolerable , " said bavarian justice minister beate merk .
ukrainian-born demjanjuk , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now stateless , is accused in a german arrest warrant of acting as an accessory to the murder of 29,000 jews at the sobibor death camp in nazi-occupied poland .
demjanjuk has denied any involvement in the deaths .
in 1988 , demjanjuk was sentenced to death by an israeli court for being the guard dubbed " ivan the terrible " at the treblinka death camp .
the israeli supreme court later ruled that demjanjuk was not " ivan , " and he returned to the united states . gb / ca / ncy , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the jury 's out the un security council has ended an emergency session without agreeing on an immediate response to north korea 's long range rocket launch .
pyongyang hails satellite launch as huge success . a united nations security council emergency session has ended with no immediate action against north korea for its rocket launch .
us president barack obama said north korea 's move was intended as a threat to countries " near and far " and that pyongyang must be forced to change .
china and russia called on all sides for restraint .
both had made clear before the launch that they would use their veto power to block any resolution imposing new sanctions on pyongyang .
un security council members " agreed to continue consultations on the appropriate reaction by the council ... given the urgency of the matter , " mexican u.n. ambassador claude heller , who holds the body 's rotating presidency , told reporters .
us ambassador susan rice and japanese ambassador yukio takasu both called for a clear and firm response and said they wanted to see a fresh resolution .
chinese ambassador zhang yesui said any reaction must be " cautious and proportionate . "
washington and tokyo want a resolution demanding stricter enforcement , and possibly expansion , of an existing arms embargo and financial sanctions .
new sanctions seem unlikely and it was unclear whether moscow and beijing would agree to a tightening of existing sanctions regime , including an arms embargo , against north korea 's communist regime .
pyongyang says that it successfully launched a communications satellite but the us and south korea called the mission a failure because the payload failed to get into orbit .
meanwhile japanese ships continue to comb the area in the pacific ocean where debris from the rocket went down to determine whether the object was a satellite or part of a long-range ballistic missile . nrt / jk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .
president must give final approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has the final say on the new leader klaus said that he would designate whoever secures an absolute majority of 101 votes in the 200-seat lower house , a condition that required cooperation between bitter foes topolanek and paroubek .
analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .

" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .
president must give final approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has the final say on the new leader klaus said that he would designate whoever secures an absolute majority of 101 votes in the 200-seat lower house , a condition that required cooperation between bitter foes topolanek and paroubek .
analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .
if fischer is confirmed in office it would end speculation among some analysts that klaus might appoint a eurosceptic cabinet that could halt ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty , meant to streamline decision-making in the 27-member bloc . nda / pfd , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey has refused to establish diplomatic ties with armenia because of its campaign to have the killings recognized as genocide .

the decision opens the way for demjanjuk to stand trial . a stay of deportation would have prevented suspected nazi war criminal john demjanjuk from being extradited to germany .
the ruling by the us immigration court in arlington , virginia , means that demjanjuk can now be deported as early as wednesday , although his lawyers can still seek another stay .
demjanjuk , 89 , had filed a last-minute emergency court motion to stop his deportation , arguing that he was too ill to make the journey to germany and stand trial .
the court 's decision has been welcomed by the world jewish congress based in new york .
president ronald lauder said in a statement that holocaust survivors demand justice .
" demjanjuk may be old and frail , " he said , " but so are many holocaust survivors whose lives were destroyed by the likes of him . "
" no nazi war criminal still alive should feel safe anywhere in the world , " he added .

the decision opens the way for demjanjuk to stand trial . a stay of deportation would have prevented suspected nazi war criminal john demjanjuk from being extradited to germany .
the ruling by the us immigration court in arlington , virginia , means that demjanjuk can now be deported as early as wednesday , although his lawyers can still seek another stay .
demjanjuk , 89 , had filed a last-minute emergency court motion to stop his deportation , arguing that he was too ill to make the journey to germany and stand trial .
the court 's decision has been welcomed by the world jewish congress based in new york .
president ronald lauder said in a statement that holocaust survivors demand justice .
" demjanjuk may be old and frail , " he said , " but so are many holocaust survivors whose lives were destroyed by the likes of him . "
" no nazi war criminal still alive should feel safe anywhere in the world , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 06.04.2009 report : abu dhabi 's royal family interested in opel investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some see opel heading to the scrapyard , others see an opportunity a german press report monday claims abu dhabi 's royal family may be set to invest in the troubled german automaker opel .
however , opel sources scotched the rumor that the arab state was interested in the ailing company . the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- newspaper quoted family member sheikh hamdan indirectly as saying that " no decision has been taken yet . "
sheikh hamdan said that a meeting he had had last week with german regional premier juergen ruettgers of the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to an opel plant , was nonetheless " very positive . "
opel , a unit of distressed us giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- , is looking for private investors to supplement aid sought from the government , and german chancellor angela merkel has indicated she would like to share the burden with others too .
abu dhabi said late last month it would take a 9.1-percent stake in daimler , the german owner of mercedes benz autos and the world 's leading truck maker , for 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.64 billion -rrb- , becoming its biggest shareholder .
klaus franz , who heads the opel labor representation council , told the dpa press agency over the weekend that there were " a whole lot of interested investors " from around the globe , but declined to name any .
however , he rejected as " unlikely " the waz report that abu dhabi was putting out political feelers for a stake .
german ministers reluctant on rescue deal also over the weekend , focus magazine reported that german officials were becoming increasingly reluctant to arrange a separate rescue deal for the german gm subsidiary after concluding that it has no assets .
at the same time , both german labor leaders and the chief executive of gm europe insisted serious talks were still being pursued to bring in an outside investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm insists an investor was still being sought for opel focus quoted an unnamed german minister saying opel 's patents , plants and real estate had already been mortgaged to the us government and us banks as security for loans , and could thus not be acquired by a new investor .
" opel is just an empty shell , " the minister was quoted as saying .
" gm no longer has any authority over the assets . "
he added that separating opel from the rest of gm would be far more complicated and costly than anyone had previously believed .
a new investor would have to negotiate the takeover with the us government and the banks .
der spiegel magazine quoted gm europe chief carl-peter forster saying potential private-equity and sovereign-capital investors remained interested in buying into the european unit .
he told spiegel that even if the gm parent company declared insolvency , production and sale of opel and vauxhall cars in europe would continue as normal .
in a related development , former german chancellor gerhard schroeder said there might be a " crisis of confidence in democracy " if efforts to put opel back on its feet fail .
he accused supporters of chancellor angela merkel of " doing nothing . " nda / ncy , dpa / afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german states reluctant to save opel opel , the german subsidiary of troubled us automaker general motors , has begun currying favor with german state governments .

however , opel sources scotched the rumor that the arab state was interested in the ailing company . the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- newspaper quoted family member sheikh hamdan indirectly as saying that " no decision has been taken yet . "
sheikh hamdan said that a meeting he had had last week with german regional premier juergen ruettgers of the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to an opel plant , was nonetheless " very positive . "
opel , a unit of distressed us giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- , is looking for private investors to supplement aid sought from the government , and german chancellor angela merkel has indicated she would like to share the burden with others too .
abu dhabi said late last month it would take a 9.1-percent stake in daimler , the german owner of mercedes benz autos and the world 's leading truck maker , for 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.64 billion -rrb- , becoming its biggest shareholder .
klaus franz , who heads the opel labor representation council , told the dpa press agency over the weekend that there were " a whole lot of interested investors " from around the globe , but declined to name any .
however , he rejected as " unlikely " the waz report that abu dhabi was putting out political feelers for a stake .
german ministers reluctant on rescue deal also over the weekend , focus magazine reported that german officials were becoming increasingly reluctant to arrange a separate rescue deal for the german gm subsidiary after concluding that it has no assets .
at the same time , both german labor leaders and the chief executive of gm europe insisted serious talks were still being pursued to bring in an outside investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm insists an investor was still being sought for opel focus quoted an unnamed german minister saying opel 's patents , plants and real estate had already been mortgaged to the us government and us banks as security for loans , and could thus not be acquired by a new investor .
" opel is just an empty shell , " the minister was quoted as saying .
" gm no longer has any authority over the assets . "
he added that separating opel from the rest of gm would be far more complicated and costly than anyone had previously believed .
a new investor would have to negotiate the takeover with the us government and the banks .
der spiegel magazine quoted gm europe chief carl-peter forster saying potential private-equity and sovereign-capital investors remained interested in buying into the european unit .
he told spiegel that even if the gm parent company declared insolvency , production and sale of opel and vauxhall cars in europe would continue as normal .

as danish prime minister he was accused of tolerating religious slurs . at the alliance of civilzations summit in istanbul , a meeting that promotes dialogue between leaders of the west and the islamic world , anders fogh rasmussen has called for a balance between religious respect and freedom of speech .
his appointment as the new secretary general of nato has been met with scepticism in the muslim world because of his track record as danish prime minister .
the turkish government of recep tayyip erdogan was one of the strongest critics of his appointment , and had threatened to veto it .
as prime minister , rasmussen did not condemn cartoons depicting the muslim prophet muhammad as a terrorist .
the images appeared in a danish newspaper in 2005 , sparking widespread criticism and protests throughout the muslim world .
rasmussen , however , said at the time that for him to intervene or punish the paper would have infringed on freedom of speech and of the press .
rasmussen did not apologize for the 2005 incident in istanbul on monday .
he said that freedom of opinion was " of central importance " to democracy , but added that respect for religious sensiblities was equally important .
he described " intensifying dialogue and cooperation " with the muslim world as one of his major tasks as nato secretary general .

forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communist party aligns itself with europe and moscow the party was once staunchly pro-russian but changed course dramatically in 2005 and today seeks closer ties with the european union as well as good ties with russia , on which it depends for gas and other supplies .
despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .
" under the present circumstances the communists can not stay in power for long , " filat said .
" the time is past when the communists could buy support from opposition ranks ... i can vouch for every member of the opposition personally . " nda / ncy , dpa / afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the players must know that they face consequences at some stage , " klinsmann told reporters after a team meeting , in which he forced his team to watch a tape of the wolfsburg match .
" after the season we will review who has worked well and who has n't . " klinsmann , who took over at munich at the start of the season , said he was angry with himself about the team 's performance but added that there was plenty of blame to go around . " i always put my head on the block when a match was lost , " he said .
" now every player must take responsibility and accept blame . " bayern no place for the weak-minded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike last year , there may not be much need for champagne in munich this season captain mark van bommel agreed that players have to re-examine their performances .

" whoever is weak in the head , does not belong at bayern munich . " the coach apparently singled out several players , with bild newspaper reporting on its website that he called the defensive work of youngster breno " unprofessional " in the wolfsburg game . klinsmann admitted he no longer considers bayern to be the favorite to lift the cup this year .
the team won last year 's title with a 10-point lead . barca match key to team 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern annihilated their last champions league opponent but face a tougher adversary in barca the bundesliga debacle set off alarm bells ahead of wednesday 's first champions league quarter-final with spanish giants barcelona .
klinsmann told players that wednesday 's match is crucial to the team 's future . " to me it is vital that everyone understands what hinges on this next game : the entire season and the future of bayern munich , " said klinsmann . munich , however , could still lift trophies as they trail wolfsburg by just three points and have never been eliminated by barca in europe . klinsmann expressed hope that his warning is observed .

the jury 's out the un security council has ended an emergency session without agreeing on an immediate response to north korea 's long range rocket launch .
pyongyang hails satellite launch as huge success . a united nations security council emergency session has ended with no immediate action against north korea for its rocket launch .
us president barack obama said north korea 's move was intended as a threat to countries " near and far " and that pyongyang must be forced to change .
china and russia called on all sides for restraint .
both had made clear before the launch that they would use their veto power to block any resolution imposing new sanctions on pyongyang .
un security council members " agreed to continue consultations on the appropriate reaction by the council ... given the urgency of the matter , " mexican u.n. ambassador claude heller , who holds the body 's rotating presidency , told reporters .
us ambassador susan rice and japanese ambassador yukio takasu both called for a clear and firm response and said they wanted to see a fresh resolution .
chinese ambassador zhang yesui said any reaction must be " cautious and proportionate . "
washington and tokyo want a resolution demanding stricter enforcement , and possibly expansion , of an existing arms embargo and financial sanctions .
new sanctions seem unlikely and it was unclear whether moscow and beijing would agree to a tightening of existing sanctions regime , including an arms embargo , against north korea 's communist regime .
pyongyang says that it successfully launched a communications satellite but the us and south korea called the mission a failure because the payload failed to get into orbit .
meanwhile japanese ships continue to comb the area in the pacific ocean where debris from the rocket went down to determine whether the object was a satellite or part of a long-range ballistic missile . nrt / jk send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .
president must give final approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has the final say on the new leader klaus said that he would designate whoever secures an absolute majority of 101 votes in the 200-seat lower house , a condition that required cooperation between bitter foes topolanek and paroubek .
analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .
if fischer is confirmed in office it would end speculation among some analysts that klaus might appoint a eurosceptic cabinet that could halt ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty , meant to streamline decision-making in the 27-member bloc . nda / pfd , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" not everything that a person is legally entitled to is also legitimate .

" we have to send a signal in the interest of social peace , which is also in our own interests , " ackerman said . just over two years ago , a court dropped charges of breach of fiduciary duty against ackermann for approving huge bonus payments in exchange for a financial settlement of 3.2 million euros . sms / pfd , reuters / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders pledged to pursue a new deal on the strategic arms reduction treaty , also known as start i. the 1991 treaty limits the number of missiles and warheads that each side may have in its arsenal and was the basis of cold war strategic arms control . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he expects the two leaders to pursue the talks seriously .

the german government must begin talks with nato on these warheads immediately . " wolfgang gehrcke , the foreign policy spokesman of germany 's left party , urged the leaders of the european union to join obama 's vision of a nuclear-free world .

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .
president must give final approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has the final say on the new leader klaus said that he would designate whoever secures an absolute majority of 101 votes in the 200-seat lower house , a condition that required cooperation between bitter foes topolanek and paroubek .
analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .
if fischer is confirmed in office it would end speculation among some analysts that klaus might appoint a eurosceptic cabinet that could halt ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty , meant to streamline decision-making in the 27-member bloc . nda / pfd , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel said .

the jury 's out the un security council has ended an emergency session without agreeing on an immediate response to north korea 's long range rocket launch .
pyongyang hails satellite launch as huge success . a united nations security council emergency session has ended with no immediate action against north korea for its rocket launch .
us president barack obama said north korea 's move was intended as a threat to countries " near and far " and that pyongyang must be forced to change .
china and russia called on all sides for restraint .
both had made clear before the launch that they would use their veto power to block any resolution imposing new sanctions on pyongyang .
un security council members " agreed to continue consultations on the appropriate reaction by the council ... given the urgency of the matter , " mexican u.n. ambassador claude heller , who holds the body 's rotating presidency , told reporters .
us ambassador susan rice and japanese ambassador yukio takasu both called for a clear and firm response and said they wanted to see a fresh resolution .
chinese ambassador zhang yesui said any reaction must be " cautious and proportionate . "
washington and tokyo want a resolution demanding stricter enforcement , and possibly expansion , of an existing arms embargo and financial sanctions .
new sanctions seem unlikely and it was unclear whether moscow and beijing would agree to a tightening of existing sanctions regime , including an arms embargo , against north korea 's communist regime .
pyongyang says that it successfully launched a communications satellite but the us and south korea called the mission a failure because the payload failed to get into orbit .

forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communist party aligns itself with europe and moscow the party was once staunchly pro-russian but changed course dramatically in 2005 and today seeks closer ties with the european union as well as good ties with russia , on which it depends for gas and other supplies .
despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .
" under the present circumstances the communists can not stay in power for long , " filat said .
" the time is past when the communists could buy support from opposition ranks ... i can vouch for every member of the opposition personally . " nda / ncy , dpa / afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communist party aligns itself with europe and moscow the party was once staunchly pro-russian but changed course dramatically in 2005 and today seeks closer ties with the european union as well as good ties with russia , on which it depends for gas and other supplies .
despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .
" under the present circumstances the communists can not stay in power for long , " filat said .
" the time is past when the communists could buy support from opposition ranks ... i can vouch for every member of the opposition personally . " nda / ncy , dpa / afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .

forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .

a statement said naumov resigned for " health reasons . "
a council of europe report in 2004 blamed naumov for being one of those responsible for the disappearance of political opponents to the lukashenko regime .
naumov and three other belarus officials were banned from travelling to the european union and the united states following the disappearances of several opposition politicians and a journalist between 1999 and 2000 .

last month , the eu decided to extend a suspension of sanctions for nine months , which included the travel ban .
however , to keep up the pressure on president lukashenko , eu ministers decided to prolong other sanctions , including an arms embargo , for another year .
belarus has sought better relations with europe in the wake of the global economic crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 06.04.2009 report : abu dhabi 's royal family interested in opel investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some see opel heading to the scrapyard , others see an opportunity a german press report monday claims abu dhabi 's royal family may be set to invest in the troubled german automaker opel .
however , opel sources scotched the rumor that the arab state was interested in the ailing company . the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- newspaper quoted family member sheikh hamdan indirectly as saying that " no decision has been taken yet . "
sheikh hamdan said that a meeting he had had last week with german regional premier juergen ruettgers of the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to an opel plant , was nonetheless " very positive . "
opel , a unit of distressed us giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- , is looking for private investors to supplement aid sought from the government , and german chancellor angela merkel has indicated she would like to share the burden with others too .
abu dhabi said late last month it would take a 9.1-percent stake in daimler , the german owner of mercedes benz autos and the world 's leading truck maker , for 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.64 billion -rrb- , becoming its biggest shareholder .
klaus franz , who heads the opel labor representation council , told the dpa press agency over the weekend that there were " a whole lot of interested investors " from around the globe , but declined to name any .
however , he rejected as " unlikely " the waz report that abu dhabi was putting out political feelers for a stake .

however , opel sources scotched the rumor that the arab state was interested in the ailing company . the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- newspaper quoted family member sheikh hamdan indirectly as saying that " no decision has been taken yet . "
sheikh hamdan said that a meeting he had had last week with german regional premier juergen ruettgers of the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to an opel plant , was nonetheless " very positive . "
opel , a unit of distressed us giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- , is looking for private investors to supplement aid sought from the government , and german chancellor angela merkel has indicated she would like to share the burden with others too .
abu dhabi said late last month it would take a 9.1-percent stake in daimler , the german owner of mercedes benz autos and the world 's leading truck maker , for 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.64 billion -rrb- , becoming its biggest shareholder .
klaus franz , who heads the opel labor representation council , told the dpa press agency over the weekend that there were " a whole lot of interested investors " from around the globe , but declined to name any .
however , he rejected as " unlikely " the waz report that abu dhabi was putting out political feelers for a stake .
german ministers reluctant on rescue deal also over the weekend , focus magazine reported that german officials were becoming increasingly reluctant to arrange a separate rescue deal for the german gm subsidiary after concluding that it has no assets .
at the same time , both german labor leaders and the chief executive of gm europe insisted serious talks were still being pursued to bring in an outside investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm insists an investor was still being sought for opel focus quoted an unnamed german minister saying opel 's patents , plants and real estate had already been mortgaged to the us government and us banks as security for loans , and could thus not be acquired by a new investor .
" opel is just an empty shell , " the minister was quoted as saying .
" gm no longer has any authority over the assets . "
he added that separating opel from the rest of gm would be far more complicated and costly than anyone had previously believed .
a new investor would have to negotiate the takeover with the us government and the banks .
der spiegel magazine quoted gm europe chief carl-peter forster saying potential private-equity and sovereign-capital investors remained interested in buying into the european unit .
he told spiegel that even if the gm parent company declared insolvency , production and sale of opel and vauxhall cars in europe would continue as normal .
in a related development , former german chancellor gerhard schroeder said there might be a " crisis of confidence in democracy " if efforts to put opel back on its feet fail .
he accused supporters of chancellor angela merkel of " doing nothing . " nda / ncy , dpa / afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german states reluctant to save opel opel , the german subsidiary of troubled us automaker general motors , has begun currying favor with german state governments .
yet this might not be enough to save the company .
-lrb- 05.04.2009 -rrb- merkel pledges to defend opel during gm restructure german chancellor angela merkel has said she will form a team of experts to negotiate a new corporate structure for german carmaker opel in talks with its troubled us parent group , general motors .

" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .

north korea 's launch of a long-range rocket has drawn a " strong condemnation " from the european union . north korea launched a long-range rocket on sunday , defying calls from world leaders to scrap a plan that has caused international alarm .
" these actions place additional strains on regional stability at a time when the unresolved nuclear issue on the korean peninsula requires mutual confidence-building , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement .
the eu called on korea to " immediately suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program and abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs in a complete , verifiable and irreversible manner . "
the us and south korean military say they have evidence that the rocket launch was not successful .
the us military said that " the payload itself landed in the pacific ocean . "
" all three stages of the rocket fell into the sea .
no object entered orbit , " south korean defense minister lee sang-hee said .
" it was a failed attempt to put a satellite into orbit . "
security council plans emergency session bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama called the launch a " provocative act " the united nations security council is to hold an emergency session to debate the north korean launch following a request from japan 's un ambassador .
china has called for a measured response on all sides .
the united states , south korea and japan believe the launch is actually the test of a taepodong-2 missile , which is designed to carry a warhead as far as alaska .
washington described the launch as a " provocative act " and said it would take " appropriate steps . " china , the nearest the reclusive north has to a major ally , and russia both called on all sides for calm and restraint .
us president barack obama said on friday the international community would take action if north korea went ahead with the launch to show pyongyang it could not act with impunity .
us warns that action will be taken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan warned north korea against launching the rocket after north korea carried out a nuclear test in 2006 , the un security council passed a resolution imposing sanctions on military goods and luxury products .
north korea was also warned not to carry out any further missile tests .
the north korean rocket launch will test us president barack obama , who announced soon after his arrival in france on friday that he wanted to move towards " a world without nuclear weapons . "
obama also addressed the nuclear issue a speech in prague .
obama blasted the rocket launch on sunday morning and promised he would push for action at the upcoming security council meeting .

the decision opens the way for demjanjuk to stand trial . a stay of deportation would have prevented suspected nazi war criminal john demjanjuk from being extradited to germany .
the ruling by the us immigration court in arlington , virginia , means that demjanjuk can now be deported as early as wednesday , although his lawyers can still seek another stay .
demjanjuk , 89 , had filed a last-minute emergency court motion to stop his deportation , arguing that he was too ill to make the journey to germany and stand trial .
the court 's decision has been welcomed by the world jewish congress based in new york .
president ronald lauder said in a statement that holocaust survivors demand justice .
" demjanjuk may be old and frail , " he said , " but so are many holocaust survivors whose lives were destroyed by the likes of him . "
" no nazi war criminal still alive should feel safe anywhere in the world , " he added .

ukrainian-born demjanjuk , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now stateless , is accused in a german arrest warrant of acting as an accessory to the murder of 29,000 jews at the sobibor death camp in nazi-occupied poland .
demjanjuk has denied any involvement in the deaths .
in 1988 , demjanjuk was sentenced to death by an israeli court for being the guard dubbed " ivan the terrible " at the treblinka death camp .

the decision opens the way for demjanjuk to stand trial . a stay of deportation would have prevented suspected nazi war criminal john demjanjuk from being extradited to germany .
the ruling by the us immigration court in arlington , virginia , means that demjanjuk can now be deported as early as wednesday , although his lawyers can still seek another stay .
demjanjuk , 89 , had filed a last-minute emergency court motion to stop his deportation , arguing that he was too ill to make the journey to germany and stand trial .
the court 's decision has been welcomed by the world jewish congress based in new york .
president ronald lauder said in a statement that holocaust survivors demand justice .
" demjanjuk may be old and frail , " he said , " but so are many holocaust survivors whose lives were destroyed by the likes of him . "
" no nazi war criminal still alive should feel safe anywhere in the world , " he added .

demjanjuk has denied any involvement in the deaths .
in 1988 , demjanjuk was sentenced to death by an israeli court for being the guard dubbed " ivan the terrible " at the treblinka death camp .

a statement said naumov resigned for " health reasons . "
a council of europe report in 2004 blamed naumov for being one of those responsible for the disappearance of political opponents to the lukashenko regime .
naumov and three other belarus officials were banned from travelling to the european union and the united states following the disappearances of several opposition politicians and a journalist between 1999 and 2000 .
all of the eu 's entry restrictions were suspended last year , after belarus released inmates , which the west considered the last of the country 's political prisoners .
last month , the eu decided to extend a suspension of sanctions for nine months , which included the travel ban .
however , to keep up the pressure on president lukashenko , eu ministers decided to prolong other sanctions , including an arms embargo , for another year .
belarus has sought better relations with europe in the wake of the global economic crisis .
in january , the international monetary fund approved an emergency loan to the minsk government worth nearly $ 2.5 billion -lrb- 1.9 billion euros -rrb- . gb / ca / ncy , afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
he also backed ankara 's eu aspirations and called on the country to patch up relations with armenia . on the final leg of his first overseas trip in turkey , president barack obama has reached out to the muslim world , calling for a greater partnership between islamic nations and the west .
" let me say this as clearly as i can : the united states is not at war with islam , " he said .
" in fact , our partnership with the muslim world is crucial to rolling back a fringe ideology that people of all faiths reject . "
but obama also said he did n't want the struggle against al qaeda to be the defining feature of the relationship .
he praised the muslim faith as one of the defining forces in the modern world and promised to seek broad engagements , based on mutual interests and respect .
" the united states has been enriched by muslim americans , " he said .
" many other americans have muslims in their family or have lived in a muslim-majority country .
i know , because i am one of them . "
turkey a crucial ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama pointed out how important turkey is to the us addressing the turkish parliament , he said that the us would soon launch outreach programs , in a bid to improve damaged relations after george w. bush 's administration .
he described his visit as " a statement about the importance of turkey , not just to the united states , but to the world . "
turkey is a key muslim ally for the united states .
obama said that while the two countries do n't agree on everything , they are stronger when working together .
he also promised to support the country 's bid to become a member of the european union , despite objections from eu member-states like france and germany .
" europe gains by diversity of ethnicity , tradition and faith - it is not diminished by it , " he said .
" and turkish membership would broaden and strengthen europe 's foundations once more . "
turkish public opinion towards the us suffered during the bush years , not least because of the iraq war .
the influential hurriyet newspaper published a front page headline on monday saying , " welcome , mr. president . ...
our hearts have been broken over the last eight years , now it is time to mend hearts . "
silent on genocide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's visit was n't just greeted with turkish delight however there , have also been mass protests against the president 's presence , not least because of his strong views about turkey 's relationship with armenia .
obama called for a full normalization of relations between armenia and turkey , but would n't comment further on the mass murder of armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 .
armenia argues that the killings were an act of genocide , ankara disagrees .
obama made it very clear during his 2008 election campaign that he considers it a " widely documented fact " that the killings amount to genocide .
however , before parliament in ankara he said his views on the matter were n't that important .
" this is really about how the turkish and armenian people deal with the past , " he said .
" and the best way forward for the turkish and armenian people is a process that works through the past in a way that is honest , open and constructive . "
marathon tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be flying home next time he boards air force one obama has now moved on from ankara to istanbul , where he will stay until tuesday .
he is expected to attend a reception , hosted by prime minister reccep tayyip erdogan , for leaders attending a un-backed international forum on bridging divisions between the islamic world and the west .
the us president will also hold talks with religious leaders , hold a round-table meeting with university students , and visit two istanbul landmarks , the hagia sophia and the blue mosque , before leaving turkey .
this is the last stop on obama 's maiden tour of europe as president .

forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communist party aligns itself with europe and moscow the party was once staunchly pro-russian but changed course dramatically in 2005 and today seeks closer ties with the european union as well as good ties with russia , on which it depends for gas and other supplies .
despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .
" under the present circumstances the communists can not stay in power for long , " filat said .

forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communist party aligns itself with europe and moscow the party was once staunchly pro-russian but changed course dramatically in 2005 and today seeks closer ties with the european union as well as good ties with russia , on which it depends for gas and other supplies .
despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .
" under the present circumstances the communists can not stay in power for long , " filat said .

forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the communist party aligns itself with europe and moscow the party was once staunchly pro-russian but changed course dramatically in 2005 and today seeks closer ties with the european union as well as good ties with russia , on which it depends for gas and other supplies .
despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .
" under the present circumstances the communists can not stay in power for long , " filat said .
" the time is past when the communists could buy support from opposition ranks ... i can vouch for every member of the opposition personally . " nda / ncy , dpa / afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , opel sources scotched the rumor that the arab state was interested in the ailing company . the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- newspaper quoted family member sheikh hamdan indirectly as saying that " no decision has been taken yet . "
sheikh hamdan said that a meeting he had had last week with german regional premier juergen ruettgers of the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to an opel plant , was nonetheless " very positive . "
opel , a unit of distressed us giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- , is looking for private investors to supplement aid sought from the government , and german chancellor angela merkel has indicated she would like to share the burden with others too .
abu dhabi said late last month it would take a 9.1-percent stake in daimler , the german owner of mercedes benz autos and the world 's leading truck maker , for 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.64 billion -rrb- , becoming its biggest shareholder .
klaus franz , who heads the opel labor representation council , told the dpa press agency over the weekend that there were " a whole lot of interested investors " from around the globe , but declined to name any .
however , he rejected as " unlikely " the waz report that abu dhabi was putting out political feelers for a stake .
german ministers reluctant on rescue deal also over the weekend , focus magazine reported that german officials were becoming increasingly reluctant to arrange a separate rescue deal for the german gm subsidiary after concluding that it has no assets .
at the same time , both german labor leaders and the chief executive of gm europe insisted serious talks were still being pursued to bring in an outside investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm insists an investor was still being sought for opel focus quoted an unnamed german minister saying opel 's patents , plants and real estate had already been mortgaged to the us government and us banks as security for loans , and could thus not be acquired by a new investor .
" opel is just an empty shell , " the minister was quoted as saying .
" gm no longer has any authority over the assets . "
he added that separating opel from the rest of gm would be far more complicated and costly than anyone had previously believed .
a new investor would have to negotiate the takeover with the us government and the banks .
der spiegel magazine quoted gm europe chief carl-peter forster saying potential private-equity and sovereign-capital investors remained interested in buying into the european unit .
he told spiegel that even if the gm parent company declared insolvency , production and sale of opel and vauxhall cars in europe would continue as normal .
in a related development , former german chancellor gerhard schroeder said there might be a " crisis of confidence in democracy " if efforts to put opel back on its feet fail .

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .

czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .
if fischer is confirmed in office it would end speculation among some analysts that klaus might appoint a eurosceptic cabinet that could halt ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty , meant to streamline decision-making in the 27-member bloc . nda / pfd , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .
president must give final approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has the final say on the new leader klaus said that he would designate whoever secures an absolute majority of 101 votes in the 200-seat lower house , a condition that required cooperation between bitter foes topolanek and paroubek .
analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .
if fischer is confirmed in office it would end speculation among some analysts that klaus might appoint a eurosceptic cabinet that could halt ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty , meant to streamline decision-making in the 27-member bloc . nda / pfd , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the jury 's out the un security council has ended an emergency session without agreeing on an immediate response to north korea 's long range rocket launch .
pyongyang hails satellite launch as huge success . a united nations security council emergency session has ended with no immediate action against north korea for its rocket launch .
us president barack obama said north korea 's move was intended as a threat to countries " near and far " and that pyongyang must be forced to change .
china and russia called on all sides for restraint .
both had made clear before the launch that they would use their veto power to block any resolution imposing new sanctions on pyongyang .
un security council members " agreed to continue consultations on the appropriate reaction by the council ... given the urgency of the matter , " mexican u.n. ambassador claude heller , who holds the body 's rotating presidency , told reporters .

chinese ambassador zhang yesui said any reaction must be " cautious and proportionate . "
washington and tokyo want a resolution demanding stricter enforcement , and possibly expansion , of an existing arms embargo and financial sanctions .
new sanctions seem unlikely and it was unclear whether moscow and beijing would agree to a tightening of existing sanctions regime , including an arms embargo , against north korea 's communist regime .
pyongyang says that it successfully launched a communications satellite but the us and south korea called the mission a failure because the payload failed to get into orbit .

pyongyang hails satellite launch as huge success . a united nations security council emergency session has ended with no immediate action against north korea for its rocket launch .
us president barack obama said north korea 's move was intended as a threat to countries " near and far " and that pyongyang must be forced to change .
china and russia called on all sides for restraint .
both had made clear before the launch that they would use their veto power to block any resolution imposing new sanctions on pyongyang .
un security council members " agreed to continue consultations on the appropriate reaction by the council ... given the urgency of the matter , " mexican u.n. ambassador claude heller , who holds the body 's rotating presidency , told reporters .

"
he also backed ankara 's eu aspirations and called on the country to patch up relations with armenia . on the final leg of his first overseas trip in turkey , president barack obama has reached out to the muslim world , calling for a greater partnership between islamic nations and the west .
" let me say this as clearly as i can : the united states is not at war with islam , " he said .
" in fact , our partnership with the muslim world is crucial to rolling back a fringe ideology that people of all faiths reject . "
but obama also said he did n't want the struggle against al qaeda to be the defining feature of the relationship .
he praised the muslim faith as one of the defining forces in the modern world and promised to seek broad engagements , based on mutual interests and respect .
" the united states has been enriched by muslim americans , " he said .
" many other americans have muslims in their family or have lived in a muslim-majority country .
i know , because i am one of them . "
turkey a crucial ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama pointed out how important turkey is to the us addressing the turkish parliament , he said that the us would soon launch outreach programs , in a bid to improve damaged relations after george w. bush 's administration .
he described his visit as " a statement about the importance of turkey , not just to the united states , but to the world . "
turkey is a key muslim ally for the united states .
obama said that while the two countries do n't agree on everything , they are stronger when working together .
he also promised to support the country 's bid to become a member of the european union , despite objections from eu member-states like france and germany .
" europe gains by diversity of ethnicity , tradition and faith - it is not diminished by it , " he said .
" and turkish membership would broaden and strengthen europe 's foundations once more . "
turkish public opinion towards the us suffered during the bush years , not least because of the iraq war .
the influential hurriyet newspaper published a front page headline on monday saying , " welcome , mr. president . ...
our hearts have been broken over the last eight years , now it is time to mend hearts . "
silent on genocide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's visit was n't just greeted with turkish delight however there , have also been mass protests against the president 's presence , not least because of his strong views about turkey 's relationship with armenia .
obama called for a full normalization of relations between armenia and turkey , but would n't comment further on the mass murder of armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 .
armenia argues that the killings were an act of genocide , ankara disagrees .
obama made it very clear during his 2008 election campaign that he considers it a " widely documented fact " that the killings amount to genocide .
however , before parliament in ankara he said his views on the matter were n't that important .
" this is really about how the turkish and armenian people deal with the past , " he said .
" and the best way forward for the turkish and armenian people is a process that works through the past in a way that is honest , open and constructive . "
marathon tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be flying home next time he boards air force one obama has now moved on from ankara to istanbul , where he will stay until tuesday .

as danish prime minister he was accused of tolerating religious slurs . at the alliance of civilzations summit in istanbul , a meeting that promotes dialogue between leaders of the west and the islamic world , anders fogh rasmussen has called for a balance between religious respect and freedom of speech .
his appointment as the new secretary general of nato has been met with scepticism in the muslim world because of his track record as danish prime minister .
the turkish government of recep tayyip erdogan was one of the strongest critics of his appointment , and had threatened to veto it .
as prime minister , rasmussen did not condemn cartoons depicting the muslim prophet muhammad as a terrorist .
the images appeared in a danish newspaper in 2005 , sparking widespread criticism and protests throughout the muslim world .
rasmussen , however , said at the time that for him to intervene or punish the paper would have infringed on freedom of speech and of the press .
rasmussen did not apologize for the 2005 incident in istanbul on monday .
he said that freedom of opinion was " of central importance " to democracy , but added that respect for religious sensiblities was equally important .
he described " intensifying dialogue and cooperation " with the muslim world as one of his major tasks as nato secretary general .

the decision opens the way for demjanjuk to stand trial . a stay of deportation would have prevented suspected nazi war criminal john demjanjuk from being extradited to germany .
the ruling by the us immigration court in arlington , virginia , means that demjanjuk can now be deported as early as wednesday , although his lawyers can still seek another stay .
demjanjuk , 89 , had filed a last-minute emergency court motion to stop his deportation , arguing that he was too ill to make the journey to germany and stand trial .
the court 's decision has been welcomed by the world jewish congress based in new york .
president ronald lauder said in a statement that holocaust survivors demand justice .
" demjanjuk may be old and frail , " he said , " but so are many holocaust survivors whose lives were destroyed by the likes of him . "
" no nazi war criminal still alive should feel safe anywhere in the world , " he added .
deportation would be " torture " demjanjuk claimed that his deportation would amount to torture because of his poor health . over the weekend , a german official said his claim was an outrage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions over his identity saved demjanjuk from the death sentence in israel " that is cynical and absolutely intolerable , " said bavarian justice minister beate merk .
ukrainian-born demjanjuk , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now stateless , is accused in a german arrest warrant of acting as an accessory to the murder of 29,000 jews at the sobibor death camp in nazi-occupied poland .
demjanjuk has denied any involvement in the deaths .
in 1988 , demjanjuk was sentenced to death by an israeli court for being the guard dubbed " ivan the terrible " at the treblinka death camp .
the israeli supreme court later ruled that demjanjuk was not " ivan , " and he returned to the united states . gb / ca / ncy , ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
he also backed ankara 's eu aspirations and called on the country to patch up relations with armenia . on the final leg of his first overseas trip in turkey , president barack obama has reached out to the muslim world , calling for a greater partnership between islamic nations and the west .
" let me say this as clearly as i can : the united states is not at war with islam , " he said .
" in fact , our partnership with the muslim world is crucial to rolling back a fringe ideology that people of all faiths reject . "
but obama also said he did n't want the struggle against al qaeda to be the defining feature of the relationship .
he praised the muslim faith as one of the defining forces in the modern world and promised to seek broad engagements , based on mutual interests and respect .
" the united states has been enriched by muslim americans , " he said .
" many other americans have muslims in their family or have lived in a muslim-majority country .
i know , because i am one of them . "
turkey a crucial ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama pointed out how important turkey is to the us addressing the turkish parliament , he said that the us would soon launch outreach programs , in a bid to improve damaged relations after george w. bush 's administration .
he described his visit as " a statement about the importance of turkey , not just to the united states , but to the world . "
turkey is a key muslim ally for the united states .
obama said that while the two countries do n't agree on everything , they are stronger when working together .
he also promised to support the country 's bid to become a member of the european union , despite objections from eu member-states like france and germany .
" europe gains by diversity of ethnicity , tradition and faith - it is not diminished by it , " he said .
" and turkish membership would broaden and strengthen europe 's foundations once more . "
turkish public opinion towards the us suffered during the bush years , not least because of the iraq war .

obama called for a full normalization of relations between armenia and turkey , but would n't comment further on the mass murder of armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 .
armenia argues that the killings were an act of genocide , ankara disagrees .
obama made it very clear during his 2008 election campaign that he considers it a " widely documented fact " that the killings amount to genocide .
however , before parliament in ankara he said his views on the matter were n't that important .
" this is really about how the turkish and armenian people deal with the past , " he said .
" and the best way forward for the turkish and armenian people is a process that works through the past in a way that is honest , open and constructive . "

the decision opens the way for demjanjuk to stand trial . a stay of deportation would have prevented suspected nazi war criminal john demjanjuk from being extradited to germany .
the ruling by the us immigration court in arlington , virginia , means that demjanjuk can now be deported as early as wednesday , although his lawyers can still seek another stay .
demjanjuk , 89 , had filed a last-minute emergency court motion to stop his deportation , arguing that he was too ill to make the journey to germany and stand trial .
the court 's decision has been welcomed by the world jewish congress based in new york .
president ronald lauder said in a statement that holocaust survivors demand justice .
" demjanjuk may be old and frail , " he said , " but so are many holocaust survivors whose lives were destroyed by the likes of him . "
" no nazi war criminal still alive should feel safe anywhere in the world , " he added .

frank-michael mros was relieved of his duties with immediate effect , a company statement said on monday .
mros will be replaced by juergen kisseberth , a long-time lidl insider .

comments like " operated on for a tumor " or " wants to get pregnant " were noted in files titled " state of health . "
it is not known if these practices were conducted across the entire lidl organization .
the supermarket chain , which employs some 53,000 people in germany alone and has nearly 4,000 stores in almost every european country as well as canada and the united states , was rocked last year by a scandal after it hired private detectives to watch employees with hidden cameras .
lidl was found guilty in that affair and fined 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- .
due to the latest revelations , trade unions representing lidl employees have called for a criminal investigation and legal consequences .

comments like " operated on for a tumor " or " wants to get pregnant " were noted in files titled " state of health . "
it is not known if these practices were conducted across the entire lidl organization .
the supermarket chain , which employs some 53,000 people in germany alone and has nearly 4,000 stores in almost every european country as well as canada and the united states , was rocked last year by a scandal after it hired private detectives to watch employees with hidden cameras .
lidl was found guilty in that affair and fined 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- .
due to the latest revelations , trade unions representing lidl employees have called for a criminal investigation and legal consequences .

forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .

despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .

however , opel sources scotched the rumor that the arab state was interested in the ailing company . the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- newspaper quoted family member sheikh hamdan indirectly as saying that " no decision has been taken yet . "
sheikh hamdan said that a meeting he had had last week with german regional premier juergen ruettgers of the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to an opel plant , was nonetheless " very positive . "
opel , a unit of distressed us giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- , is looking for private investors to supplement aid sought from the government , and german chancellor angela merkel has indicated she would like to share the burden with others too .

he added that separating opel from the rest of gm would be far more complicated and costly than anyone had previously believed .

however , opel sources scotched the rumor that the arab state was interested in the ailing company . the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- newspaper quoted family member sheikh hamdan indirectly as saying that " no decision has been taken yet . "
sheikh hamdan said that a meeting he had had last week with german regional premier juergen ruettgers of the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to an opel plant , was nonetheless " very positive . "
opel , a unit of distressed us giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- , is looking for private investors to supplement aid sought from the government , and german chancellor angela merkel has indicated she would like to share the burden with others too .
abu dhabi said late last month it would take a 9.1-percent stake in daimler , the german owner of mercedes benz autos and the world 's leading truck maker , for 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.64 billion -rrb- , becoming its biggest shareholder .
klaus franz , who heads the opel labor representation council , told the dpa press agency over the weekend that there were " a whole lot of interested investors " from around the globe , but declined to name any .
however , he rejected as " unlikely " the waz report that abu dhabi was putting out political feelers for a stake .
german ministers reluctant on rescue deal also over the weekend , focus magazine reported that german officials were becoming increasingly reluctant to arrange a separate rescue deal for the german gm subsidiary after concluding that it has no assets .
at the same time , both german labor leaders and the chief executive of gm europe insisted serious talks were still being pursued to bring in an outside investor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm insists an investor was still being sought for opel focus quoted an unnamed german minister saying opel 's patents , plants and real estate had already been mortgaged to the us government and us banks as security for loans , and could thus not be acquired by a new investor .
" opel is just an empty shell , " the minister was quoted as saying .
" gm no longer has any authority over the assets . "
he added that separating opel from the rest of gm would be far more complicated and costly than anyone had previously believed .
a new investor would have to negotiate the takeover with the us government and the banks .
der spiegel magazine quoted gm europe chief carl-peter forster saying potential private-equity and sovereign-capital investors remained interested in buying into the european unit .
he told spiegel that even if the gm parent company declared insolvency , production and sale of opel and vauxhall cars in europe would continue as normal .
in a related development , former german chancellor gerhard schroeder said there might be a " crisis of confidence in democracy " if efforts to put opel back on its feet fail .

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .
president must give final approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has the final say on the new leader klaus said that he would designate whoever secures an absolute majority of 101 votes in the 200-seat lower house , a condition that required cooperation between bitter foes topolanek and paroubek .
analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .
if fischer is confirmed in office it would end speculation among some analysts that klaus might appoint a eurosceptic cabinet that could halt ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty , meant to streamline decision-making in the 27-member bloc . nda / pfd , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .
president must give final approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has the final say on the new leader klaus said that he would designate whoever secures an absolute majority of 101 votes in the 200-seat lower house , a condition that required cooperation between bitter foes topolanek and paroubek .
analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .
if fischer is confirmed in office it would end speculation among some analysts that klaus might appoint a eurosceptic cabinet that could halt ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty , meant to streamline decision-making in the 27-member bloc . nda / pfd , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the players must know that they face consequences at some stage , " klinsmann told reporters after a team meeting , in which he forced his team to watch a tape of the wolfsburg match .
" after the season we will review who has worked well and who has n't . " klinsmann , who took over at munich at the start of the season , said he was angry with himself about the team 's performance but added that there was plenty of blame to go around . " i always put my head on the block when a match was lost , " he said .

" whoever is weak in the head , does not belong at bayern munich . " the coach apparently singled out several players , with bild newspaper reporting on its website that he called the defensive work of youngster breno " unprofessional " in the wolfsburg game . klinsmann admitted he no longer considers bayern to be the favorite to lift the cup this year .
the team won last year 's title with a 10-point lead . barca match key to team 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern annihilated their last champions league opponent but face a tougher adversary in barca the bundesliga debacle set off alarm bells ahead of wednesday 's first champions league quarter-final with spanish giants barcelona .
klinsmann told players that wednesday 's match is crucial to the team 's future . " to me it is vital that everyone understands what hinges on this next game : the entire season and the future of bayern munich , " said klinsmann . munich , however , could still lift trophies as they trail wolfsburg by just three points and have never been eliminated by barca in europe . klinsmann expressed hope that his warning is observed .

the decision opens the way for demjanjuk to stand trial . a stay of deportation would have prevented suspected nazi war criminal john demjanjuk from being extradited to germany .
the ruling by the us immigration court in arlington , virginia , means that demjanjuk can now be deported as early as wednesday , although his lawyers can still seek another stay .
demjanjuk , 89 , had filed a last-minute emergency court motion to stop his deportation , arguing that he was too ill to make the journey to germany and stand trial .
the court 's decision has been welcomed by the world jewish congress based in new york .
president ronald lauder said in a statement that holocaust survivors demand justice .
" demjanjuk may be old and frail , " he said , " but so are many holocaust survivors whose lives were destroyed by the likes of him . "
" no nazi war criminal still alive should feel safe anywhere in the world , " he added .
deportation would be " torture " demjanjuk claimed that his deportation would amount to torture because of his poor health . over the weekend , a german official said his claim was an outrage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions over his identity saved demjanjuk from the death sentence in israel " that is cynical and absolutely intolerable , " said bavarian justice minister beate merk .
ukrainian-born demjanjuk , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now stateless , is accused in a german arrest warrant of acting as an accessory to the murder of 29,000 jews at the sobibor death camp in nazi-occupied poland .
demjanjuk has denied any involvement in the deaths .
in 1988 , demjanjuk was sentenced to death by an israeli court for being the guard dubbed " ivan the terrible " at the treblinka death camp .

the jury 's out the un security council has ended an emergency session without agreeing on an immediate response to north korea 's long range rocket launch .
pyongyang hails satellite launch as huge success . a united nations security council emergency session has ended with no immediate action against north korea for its rocket launch .
us president barack obama said north korea 's move was intended as a threat to countries " near and far " and that pyongyang must be forced to change .
china and russia called on all sides for restraint .
both had made clear before the launch that they would use their veto power to block any resolution imposing new sanctions on pyongyang .
un security council members " agreed to continue consultations on the appropriate reaction by the council ... given the urgency of the matter , " mexican u.n. ambassador claude heller , who holds the body 's rotating presidency , told reporters .
us ambassador susan rice and japanese ambassador yukio takasu both called for a clear and firm response and said they wanted to see a fresh resolution .
chinese ambassador zhang yesui said any reaction must be " cautious and proportionate . "
washington and tokyo want a resolution demanding stricter enforcement , and possibly expansion , of an existing arms embargo and financial sanctions .
new sanctions seem unlikely and it was unclear whether moscow and beijing would agree to a tightening of existing sanctions regime , including an arms embargo , against north korea 's communist regime .
pyongyang says that it successfully launched a communications satellite but the us and south korea called the mission a failure because the payload failed to get into orbit .

" not everything that a person is legally entitled to is also legitimate .

" we have to send a signal in the interest of social peace , which is also in our own interests , " ackerman said . just over two years ago , a court dropped charges of breach of fiduciary duty against ackermann for approving huge bonus payments in exchange for a financial settlement of 3.2 million euros . sms / pfd , reuters / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
he also backed ankara 's eu aspirations and called on the country to patch up relations with armenia . on the final leg of his first overseas trip in turkey , president barack obama has reached out to the muslim world , calling for a greater partnership between islamic nations and the west .
" let me say this as clearly as i can : the united states is not at war with islam , " he said .
" in fact , our partnership with the muslim world is crucial to rolling back a fringe ideology that people of all faiths reject . "
but obama also said he did n't want the struggle against al qaeda to be the defining feature of the relationship .
he praised the muslim faith as one of the defining forces in the modern world and promised to seek broad engagements , based on mutual interests and respect .
" the united states has been enriched by muslim americans , " he said .
" many other americans have muslims in their family or have lived in a muslim-majority country .
i know , because i am one of them . "
turkey a crucial ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama pointed out how important turkey is to the us addressing the turkish parliament , he said that the us would soon launch outreach programs , in a bid to improve damaged relations after george w. bush 's administration .
he described his visit as " a statement about the importance of turkey , not just to the united states , but to the world . "
turkey is a key muslim ally for the united states .
obama said that while the two countries do n't agree on everything , they are stronger when working together .
he also promised to support the country 's bid to become a member of the european union , despite objections from eu member-states like france and germany .
" europe gains by diversity of ethnicity , tradition and faith - it is not diminished by it , " he said .
" and turkish membership would broaden and strengthen europe 's foundations once more . "
turkish public opinion towards the us suffered during the bush years , not least because of the iraq war .
the influential hurriyet newspaper published a front page headline on monday saying , " welcome , mr. president . ...
our hearts have been broken over the last eight years , now it is time to mend hearts . "
silent on genocide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's visit was n't just greeted with turkish delight however there , have also been mass protests against the president 's presence , not least because of his strong views about turkey 's relationship with armenia .
obama called for a full normalization of relations between armenia and turkey , but would n't comment further on the mass murder of armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 .
armenia argues that the killings were an act of genocide , ankara disagrees .
obama made it very clear during his 2008 election campaign that he considers it a " widely documented fact " that the killings amount to genocide .
however , before parliament in ankara he said his views on the matter were n't that important .
" this is really about how the turkish and armenian people deal with the past , " he said .
" and the best way forward for the turkish and armenian people is a process that works through the past in a way that is honest , open and constructive . "
marathon tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be flying home next time he boards air force one obama has now moved on from ankara to istanbul , where he will stay until tuesday .
he is expected to attend a reception , hosted by prime minister reccep tayyip erdogan , for leaders attending a un-backed international forum on bridging divisions between the islamic world and the west .
the us president will also hold talks with religious leaders , hold a round-table meeting with university students , and visit two istanbul landmarks , the hagia sophia and the blue mosque , before leaving turkey .
this is the last stop on obama 's maiden tour of europe as president .

"
he also backed ankara 's eu aspirations and called on the country to patch up relations with armenia . on the final leg of his first overseas trip in turkey , president barack obama has reached out to the muslim world , calling for a greater partnership between islamic nations and the west .
" let me say this as clearly as i can : the united states is not at war with islam , " he said .
" in fact , our partnership with the muslim world is crucial to rolling back a fringe ideology that people of all faiths reject . "
but obama also said he did n't want the struggle against al qaeda to be the defining feature of the relationship .
he praised the muslim faith as one of the defining forces in the modern world and promised to seek broad engagements , based on mutual interests and respect .
" the united states has been enriched by muslim americans , " he said .
" many other americans have muslims in their family or have lived in a muslim-majority country .
i know , because i am one of them . "
turkey a crucial ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama pointed out how important turkey is to the us addressing the turkish parliament , he said that the us would soon launch outreach programs , in a bid to improve damaged relations after george w. bush 's administration .
he described his visit as " a statement about the importance of turkey , not just to the united states , but to the world . "
turkey is a key muslim ally for the united states .
obama said that while the two countries do n't agree on everything , they are stronger when working together .
he also promised to support the country 's bid to become a member of the european union , despite objections from eu member-states like france and germany .
" europe gains by diversity of ethnicity , tradition and faith - it is not diminished by it , " he said .
" and turkish membership would broaden and strengthen europe 's foundations once more . "
turkish public opinion towards the us suffered during the bush years , not least because of the iraq war .
the influential hurriyet newspaper published a front page headline on monday saying , " welcome , mr. president . ...
our hearts have been broken over the last eight years , now it is time to mend hearts . "
silent on genocide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's visit was n't just greeted with turkish delight however there , have also been mass protests against the president 's presence , not least because of his strong views about turkey 's relationship with armenia .
obama called for a full normalization of relations between armenia and turkey , but would n't comment further on the mass murder of armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 .
armenia argues that the killings were an act of genocide , ankara disagrees .
obama made it very clear during his 2008 election campaign that he considers it a " widely documented fact " that the killings amount to genocide .
however , before parliament in ankara he said his views on the matter were n't that important .
" this is really about how the turkish and armenian people deal with the past , " he said .
" and the best way forward for the turkish and armenian people is a process that works through the past in a way that is honest , open and constructive . "
marathon tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be flying home next time he boards air force one obama has now moved on from ankara to istanbul , where he will stay until tuesday .
he is expected to attend a reception , hosted by prime minister reccep tayyip erdogan , for leaders attending a un-backed international forum on bridging divisions between the islamic world and the west .
the us president will also hold talks with religious leaders , hold a round-table meeting with university students , and visit two istanbul landmarks , the hagia sophia and the blue mosque , before leaving turkey .
this is the last stop on obama 's maiden tour of europe as president .

forecasts showed the communists would secure 60 of the 101 seats in the parliament , election commission officials said .
some media reports said the communists would win at least 61 seats , which would put the party in a position to select the country 's next president .
final official results of the vote were expected to be announced wednesday .
voronin said the next legislature and the government it selects would continue policies of past years .
" why should we change anything , if the direction we 've taken has produced such good -lsb- election -rsb- results ? " he asked reporters at a press conference .
three center-right opposition parties also appeared to be on track to place members in moldova 's 101-seat legislature .
the communists were followed in a distant second place by the liberal party with 12.78 percent of the vote and the liberal democrats -lrb- lpdm -rrb- with 12.26 percent , election officials said .
no chance of coalition government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moldova 's president and communist party leader vladimir voronin but voronin said that the communists would not consider a long-term coalition government , but might well have to vote in the next president in cooperation with the opposition .
" we have splendidly managed the country for eight years without a coalition .
if we get enough votes to form a government , it still may be , that we will need a coalition for the election of a president , " voronin said .
eight other parties and five individual candidates failed to overcome a minimum percentage needed to place representatives in parliament , the barrier being 6 percent for parties and 3 percent for individual candidates .
voronin , europe 's only communist president , is scheduled to step down on april 7 after two consecutive terms .
he is barred by the constitution from running for a third term .
his successor was to be elected between april 8 and june 8 .
moldovan media was widely reporting current moldovan prime minister zinaida greceanii , a close voronin ally , as the communists ' most likely candidate to be the next president .
pro-european with links to moscow the communists , who have pledged to build a " european moldova " while maintaining friendly ties with moscow , came to power in 2001 and were reelected in 2005 .

despite speculation suggesting demonstrations against the vote , opposition leaders by monday morning had made no charges of voting fraud but said they " reserved the right " to demonstrate against the election results if the final count appeared flawed .
" we have reserved -lsb- the capital -rsb- chisinau 's central square for the next two weeks , " said vladimir filat , leader of the liberal democrats , on a pro-tv television report .
" we are not professional revolutionaries , but if we obtain evidence of vote-fixing by the ruling party , we will go out on the streets , " he said .
a difference between actual numbers produced by ballot counts and support predicted for the communists by an independent exit poll conducted by the imas survey company with european union and us support was a possible reason for opposition demonstrations , the infotag news agency reported .
but filat and other opposition leaders made clear they intended first to challenge the communists in parliament by forming a shadow government to prepare for the present administration 's fall .

"
he also backed ankara 's eu aspirations and called on the country to patch up relations with armenia . on the final leg of his first overseas trip in turkey , president barack obama has reached out to the muslim world , calling for a greater partnership between islamic nations and the west .
" let me say this as clearly as i can : the united states is not at war with islam , " he said .
" in fact , our partnership with the muslim world is crucial to rolling back a fringe ideology that people of all faiths reject . "
but obama also said he did n't want the struggle against al qaeda to be the defining feature of the relationship .
he praised the muslim faith as one of the defining forces in the modern world and promised to seek broad engagements , based on mutual interests and respect .
" the united states has been enriched by muslim americans , " he said .
" many other americans have muslims in their family or have lived in a muslim-majority country .
i know , because i am one of them . "
turkey a crucial ally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama pointed out how important turkey is to the us addressing the turkish parliament , he said that the us would soon launch outreach programs , in a bid to improve damaged relations after george w. bush 's administration .
he described his visit as " a statement about the importance of turkey , not just to the united states , but to the world . "
turkey is a key muslim ally for the united states .
obama said that while the two countries do n't agree on everything , they are stronger when working together .
he also promised to support the country 's bid to become a member of the european union , despite objections from eu member-states like france and germany .
" europe gains by diversity of ethnicity , tradition and faith - it is not diminished by it , " he said .
" and turkish membership would broaden and strengthen europe 's foundations once more . "
turkish public opinion towards the us suffered during the bush years , not least because of the iraq war .
the influential hurriyet newspaper published a front page headline on monday saying , " welcome , mr. president . ...
our hearts have been broken over the last eight years , now it is time to mend hearts . "
silent on genocide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's visit was n't just greeted with turkish delight however there , have also been mass protests against the president 's presence , not least because of his strong views about turkey 's relationship with armenia .
obama called for a full normalization of relations between armenia and turkey , but would n't comment further on the mass murder of armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 .
armenia argues that the killings were an act of genocide , ankara disagrees .
obama made it very clear during his 2008 election campaign that he considers it a " widely documented fact " that the killings amount to genocide .
however , before parliament in ankara he said his views on the matter were n't that important .
" this is really about how the turkish and armenian people deal with the past , " he said .
" and the best way forward for the turkish and armenian people is a process that works through the past in a way that is honest , open and constructive . "
marathon tour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama will be flying home next time he boards air force one obama has now moved on from ankara to istanbul , where he will stay until tuesday .

north korea 's launch of a long-range rocket has drawn a " strong condemnation " from the european union . north korea launched a long-range rocket on sunday , defying calls from world leaders to scrap a plan that has caused international alarm .
" these actions place additional strains on regional stability at a time when the unresolved nuclear issue on the korean peninsula requires mutual confidence-building , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement .
the eu called on korea to " immediately suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program and abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs in a complete , verifiable and irreversible manner . "
the us and south korean military say they have evidence that the rocket launch was not successful .
the us military said that " the payload itself landed in the pacific ocean . "
" all three stages of the rocket fell into the sea .
no object entered orbit , " south korean defense minister lee sang-hee said .
" it was a failed attempt to put a satellite into orbit . "
security council plans emergency session bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama called the launch a " provocative act " the united nations security council is to hold an emergency session to debate the north korean launch following a request from japan 's un ambassador .

washington described the launch as a " provocative act " and said it would take " appropriate steps . " china , the nearest the reclusive north has to a major ally , and russia both called on all sides for calm and restraint .
us president barack obama said on friday the international community would take action if north korea went ahead with the launch to show pyongyang it could not act with impunity .

the north korean rocket launch will test us president barack obama , who announced soon after his arrival in france on friday that he wanted to move towards " a world without nuclear weapons . "
obama also addressed the nuclear issue a speech in prague .
obama blasted the rocket launch on sunday morning and promised he would push for action at the upcoming security council meeting .

the party leaders also agreed to hold early elections before october 15 , the ctk news agency reported .
topolanek 's government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote on march 24 .
" we want this news to give reassurance to the public that we will have a stable government until an early election , " topolanek told a news conference after talks with other political parties in a bid to restore confidence in the political process after personal rivalries and defections from the government brought his tenure to an end .
he said the government 's duties would be to complete the czech republic 's european union presidency , prepare the 2010 budget and help push through measures against the economic downturn .
fischer 's cabinet is expected to take over from topolanek on may 9 .
the czech eu presidency ends on june 30 .
decision reached over party lines the deal was forged by leaders of four of the five parties in parliament 's lower house , excluding the opposition communists , whose participation in government has been a taboo since communism fell in then-czechoslovakia in 1989 .
the dealmakers included chiefs of the two main rival parties - topolanek and opposition social democratic leader jiri paroubek , as well as the leaders of topolanek 's junior coalition partners , the christian democrats and the greens .
the agreement is subject to approval by leaderships of the three parties in topolanek 's center-right coalition and the leftist opposition social democrats , which is expected in the coming days .
the social democrats said they were happy with the choice of the 58-year-old fischer .
" this is a consensual proposal , mr. fischer is a very experienced civil servant , " social democrat chief paroubek said , adding none of the outgoing ministers would keep their posts , a move confirmed by the pravo daily in its online edition .
if endorsed by wider party leaderships , the interim government decision would move to president vaclav klaus , who has the right to appoint the next premier .
president must give final approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has the final say on the new leader klaus said that he would designate whoever secures an absolute majority of 101 votes in the 200-seat lower house , a condition that required cooperation between bitter foes topolanek and paroubek .
analysts say that fear of the president 's intervention united the two opponents .
czech lawmakers can force snap polls without the president if at least 120 of members pass a bill cutting short their four-year term .
fischer , who would be a newcomer to the world of top-level politics , following a statistics career mostly in public sector and academia , will accept the nomination if klaus agrees , his spokesman said .
if fischer is confirmed in office it would end speculation among some analysts that klaus might appoint a eurosceptic cabinet that could halt ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty , meant to streamline decision-making in the 27-member bloc . nda / pfd , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

frank-michael mros was relieved of his duties with immediate effect , a company statement said on monday .
mros will be replaced by juergen kisseberth , a long-time lidl insider .
documents found recently in a dumpster in the ruhr industrial region indicated that the company had violated data protection laws by compiling information of a private nature on staff members in 2008 and 2009 .
comments like " operated on for a tumor " or " wants to get pregnant " were noted in files titled " state of health . "
it is not known if these practices were conducted across the entire lidl organization .
the supermarket chain , which employs some 53,000 people in germany alone and has nearly 4,000 stores in almost every european country as well as canada and the united states , was rocked last year by a scandal after it hired private detectives to watch employees with hidden cameras .
lidl was found guilty in that affair and fined 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- .

the german government must begin talks with nato on these warheads immediately . " wolfgang gehrcke , the foreign policy spokesman of germany 's left party , urged the leaders of the european union to join obama 's vision of a nuclear-free world .

at 81 he carries himself quite well .
but he looked more relaxed , assured and confident when i met him a year ago , shortly after he had published his autobiography .
this time one could detect a certain tension , a kind of restlessness .
not difficult to understand considering it 's election time , he is leading his party 's campaign and on a personal front the stakes could not be higher .
hung parliament this is the first time in several decades that former prime minister atal behari vajpayee is not the bjp 's mascot in a parliamentary election .
lk advani profile lk advani 's other side that responsibility now rests on mr advani and the veteran leader realises that this year 's elections could well be his last shot at trying to become the country 's prime minister .
he also realises it 's not an easy election .
a key ally has deserted the bjp-led alliance , the party is still looking to identify the one big issue with which to connect with the masses and there is a growing perception among political observers that the elections may throw up another hung parliament with a number of smaller , regional parties holding the key to power .
" but i do n't see any chance of a third front - a non-congress party or non-bjp government coming to power .
whichever group or party forms the government in delhi it will have to seek the support of either congress or the bjp , " mr advani says .
the bjp 's election slogan of " strong leader , decisive government " is aimed at trying to exploit this perception of confusion and chaos after the elections .
the projection of mr advani as a strong leader is also part of a careful two-pronged strategy .
it is an image the party has assiduously tried to build over the years .
mr advani 's decisiveness has been contrasted by the bjp in the run-up to this campaign with the character of congress leader and prime minister manmohan singh , who has been portrayed as a weak man constantly in deference to the party president , sonia gandhi .
but as the election campaign gathers heat and momentum mr advani has been keen to take the debate away from personalities to issues .
so during our nearly one-hour conversation this time he chose not to attack the prime minister by name even once .
the bjp leader chose to concentrate on what he described as the failures of the congress-led coalition .
anti-muslim image " there is not even one success which i can credit to this government .
i ca n't think of any other government in my 60 years of public life which ca n't boast of even one achievement .
" all that this government has done is run to the usa each time india is in trouble .
even post 26/11 -lrb- the mumbai terror attack -rrb- all the pressure was exerted on pakistan by the west , particularly the usa .
" washington is this government 's police station and they run at the smallest pretext to register their complaint there . "
mr advani was keen to shrug of his anti-muslim image .
not an easy task considering the bjp leader has always been seen as a hardliner .
he shot to prominence by launching and leading a controversial campaign for the construction of a lord ram temple in the northern indian town of ayodhya which resulted in the demolition of the 16th century babri mosque there .
but in recent years mr advani has attempted to seek an image makeover .
he all but lost the chance to lead his party in this year 's election campaign when a couple of years ago - during a much publicised visit to pakistan - he showered praise on mohammad ali jinnah , pakistan 's founder and certainly not a very popular figure among the hindu right in india .
mr advani was roundly criticised for his positive remarks on jinnah .
his party virtually disowned him and for a brief while it looked as if it was curtains on the bjp leader 's public life .
retirement " but the party soon appreciated i had said nothing wrong .
ours is a democratic party and once the leadership realised its mistake we made amends . "
mr advani may not like to dwell too much on intra-bjp tensions but it 's clear that he firmly believes that the jinnah episode was a turning point in his relationship with muslims .
" nowhere was i perceived as an enemy more than in pakistan .
but after my visit and my comments on jinnah , my image in pakistan has completely changed .
i am now seen by them as a friend .
" it 's only a matter of time before indian muslims also realise that certain parties have exploited their mistrust for the bjp by instilling a sense of fear in them .
i am sure muslims will soon see that their welfare is best served by the bjp . "
mr advani said he was optimistic about his party doing well in these elections .
" we should be able to form the government . "
it 's always difficult to tell , but he appeared to sound a bit hesitant making these bold assertions .
certainly he did not have the swagger of a sure-fire winner .
but then to be fair to him it 's difficult to find one leader who projects that kind of confidence in indian elections .
so will this be his last election if he loses ?
considering he is in his eighties , will he contemplate retirement if his party does not form the government ?
" why should i ? " this veteran politician responds defiantly .
" out of my 60 years in public life , only eight have been in power .
i never feel that i am not doing anything constructive if i am out of power .
we will sit in the opposition .
" my only wish is that i am still healthy whenever i decide to opt out of active public life .
that will be a good way to go . "

he also realises it 's not an easy election .
a key ally has deserted the bjp-led alliance , the party is still looking to identify the one big issue with which to connect with the masses and there is a growing perception among political observers that the elections may throw up another hung parliament with a number of smaller , regional parties holding the key to power .
" but i do n't see any chance of a third front - a non-congress party or non-bjp government coming to power .
whichever group or party forms the government in delhi it will have to seek the support of either congress or the bjp , " mr advani says .
the bjp 's election slogan of " strong leader , decisive government " is aimed at trying to exploit this perception of confusion and chaos after the elections .
the projection of mr advani as a strong leader is also part of a careful two-pronged strategy .
it is an image the party has assiduously tried to build over the years .
mr advani 's decisiveness has been contrasted by the bjp in the run-up to this campaign with the character of congress leader and prime minister manmohan singh , who has been portrayed as a weak man constantly in deference to the party president , sonia gandhi .
but as the election campaign gathers heat and momentum mr advani has been keen to take the debate away from personalities to issues .
so during our nearly one-hour conversation this time he chose not to attack the prime minister by name even once .
the bjp leader chose to concentrate on what he described as the failures of the congress-led coalition .
anti-muslim image " there is not even one success which i can credit to this government .
i ca n't think of any other government in my 60 years of public life which ca n't boast of even one achievement .
the destruction of the babri mosque has dogged mr advani " all that this government has done is run to the usa each time india is in trouble .
even post 26/11 -lrb- the mumbai terror attack -rrb- all the pressure was exerted on pakistan by the west , particularly the usa .
" washington is this government 's police station and they run at the smallest pretext to register their complaint there . "
mr advani was keen to shrug of his anti-muslim image .
not an easy task considering the bjp leader has always been seen as a hardliner .
he shot to prominence by launching and leading a controversial campaign for the construction of a lord ram temple in the northern indian town of ayodhya which resulted in the demolition of the 16th century babri mosque there .
but in recent years mr advani has attempted to seek an image makeover .
he all but lost the chance to lead his party in this year 's election campaign when a couple of years ago - during a much publicised visit to pakistan - he showered praise on mohammad ali jinnah , pakistan 's founder and certainly not a very popular figure among the hindu right in india .
mr advani was roundly criticised for his positive remarks on jinnah .
his party virtually disowned him and for a brief while it looked as if it was curtains on the bjp leader 's public life .
retirement " but the party soon appreciated i had said nothing wrong .
ours is a democratic party and once the leadership realised its mistake we made amends . "
lk advani 's comments during a visit to jinnah 's mausoleum sparked a furore mr advani may not like to dwell too much on intra-bjp tensions but it 's clear that he firmly believes that the jinnah episode was a turning point in his relationship with muslims .
" nowhere was i perceived as an enemy more than in pakistan .
but after my visit and my comments on jinnah , my image in pakistan has completely changed .
i am now seen by them as a friend .
" it 's only a matter of time before indian muslims also realise that certain parties have exploited their mistrust for the bjp by instilling a sense of fear in them .
i am sure muslims will soon see that their welfare is best served by the bjp . "
mr advani said he was optimistic about his party doing well in these elections .
" we should be able to form the government . "
it 's always difficult to tell , but he appeared to sound a bit hesitant making these bold assertions .
certainly he did not have the swagger of a sure-fire winner .
but then to be fair to him it 's difficult to find one leader who projects that kind of confidence in indian elections .
so will this be his last election if he loses ?
considering he is in his eighties , will he contemplate retirement if his party does not form the government ?
" why should i ? " this veteran politician responds defiantly .
" out of my 60 years in public life , only eight have been in power .
i never feel that i am not doing anything constructive if i am out of power .
we will sit in the opposition .
" my only wish is that i am still healthy whenever i decide to opt out of active public life .
that will be a good way to go . "

at 81 he carries himself quite well .
but he looked more relaxed , assured and confident when i met him a year ago , shortly after he had published his autobiography .
this time one could detect a certain tension , a kind of restlessness .
not difficult to understand considering it 's election time , he is leading his party 's campaign and on a personal front the stakes could not be higher .
hung parliament this is the first time in several decades that former prime minister atal behari vajpayee is not the bjp 's mascot in a parliamentary election .
lk advani profile lk advani 's other side that responsibility now rests on mr advani and the veteran leader realises that this year 's elections could well be his last shot at trying to become the country 's prime minister .
he also realises it 's not an easy election .
a key ally has deserted the bjp-led alliance , the party is still looking to identify the one big issue with which to connect with the masses and there is a growing perception among political observers that the elections may throw up another hung parliament with a number of smaller , regional parties holding the key to power .
" but i do n't see any chance of a third front - a non-congress party or non-bjp government coming to power .
whichever group or party forms the government in delhi it will have to seek the support of either congress or the bjp , " mr advani says .
the bjp 's election slogan of " strong leader , decisive government " is aimed at trying to exploit this perception of confusion and chaos after the elections .
the projection of mr advani as a strong leader is also part of a careful two-pronged strategy .
it is an image the party has assiduously tried to build over the years .
mr advani 's decisiveness has been contrasted by the bjp in the run-up to this campaign with the character of congress leader and prime minister manmohan singh , who has been portrayed as a weak man constantly in deference to the party president , sonia gandhi .
but as the election campaign gathers heat and momentum mr advani has been keen to take the debate away from personalities to issues .
so during our nearly one-hour conversation this time he chose not to attack the prime minister by name even once .
the bjp leader chose to concentrate on what he described as the failures of the congress-led coalition .
anti-muslim image " there is not even one success which i can credit to this government .
i ca n't think of any other government in my 60 years of public life which ca n't boast of even one achievement .
the destruction of the babri mosque has dogged mr advani " all that this government has done is run to the usa each time india is in trouble .
even post 26/11 -lrb- the mumbai terror attack -rrb- all the pressure was exerted on pakistan by the west , particularly the usa .
" washington is this government 's police station and they run at the smallest pretext to register their complaint there . "
mr advani was keen to shrug of his anti-muslim image .
not an easy task considering the bjp leader has always been seen as a hardliner .
he shot to prominence by launching and leading a controversial campaign for the construction of a lord ram temple in the northern indian town of ayodhya which resulted in the demolition of the 16th century babri mosque there .
but in recent years mr advani has attempted to seek an image makeover .
he all but lost the chance to lead his party in this year 's election campaign when a couple of years ago - during a much publicised visit to pakistan - he showered praise on mohammad ali jinnah , pakistan 's founder and certainly not a very popular figure among the hindu right in india .
mr advani was roundly criticised for his positive remarks on jinnah .
his party virtually disowned him and for a brief while it looked as if it was curtains on the bjp leader 's public life .
retirement " but the party soon appreciated i had said nothing wrong .
ours is a democratic party and once the leadership realised its mistake we made amends . "
lk advani 's comments during a visit to jinnah 's mausoleum sparked a furore mr advani may not like to dwell too much on intra-bjp tensions but it 's clear that he firmly believes that the jinnah episode was a turning point in his relationship with muslims .
" nowhere was i perceived as an enemy more than in pakistan .
but after my visit and my comments on jinnah , my image in pakistan has completely changed .
i am now seen by them as a friend .
" it 's only a matter of time before indian muslims also realise that certain parties have exploited their mistrust for the bjp by instilling a sense of fear in them .
i am sure muslims will soon see that their welfare is best served by the bjp . "
mr advani said he was optimistic about his party doing well in these elections .
" we should be able to form the government . "
it 's always difficult to tell , but he appeared to sound a bit hesitant making these bold assertions .
certainly he did not have the swagger of a sure-fire winner .
but then to be fair to him it 's difficult to find one leader who projects that kind of confidence in indian elections .
so will this be his last election if he loses ?
considering he is in his eighties , will he contemplate retirement if his party does not form the government ?
" why should i ? " this veteran politician responds defiantly .
" out of my 60 years in public life , only eight have been in power .
i never feel that i am not doing anything constructive if i am out of power .
we will sit in the opposition .
" my only wish is that i am still healthy whenever i decide to opt out of active public life .
that will be a good way to go . "

not difficult to understand considering it 's election time , he is leading his party 's campaign and on a personal front the stakes could not be higher .
hung parliament this is the first time in several decades that former prime minister atal behari vajpayee is not the bjp 's mascot in a parliamentary election .
lk advani profile lk advani 's other side that responsibility now rests on mr advani and the veteran leader realises that this year 's elections could well be his last shot at trying to become the country 's prime minister .
he also realises it 's not an easy election .
a key ally has deserted the bjp-led alliance , the party is still looking to identify the one big issue with which to connect with the masses and there is a growing perception among political observers that the elections may throw up another hung parliament with a number of smaller , regional parties holding the key to power .
" but i do n't see any chance of a third front - a non-congress party or non-bjp government coming to power .
whichever group or party forms the government in delhi it will have to seek the support of either congress or the bjp , " mr advani says .
the bjp 's election slogan of " strong leader , decisive government " is aimed at trying to exploit this perception of confusion and chaos after the elections .
the projection of mr advani as a strong leader is also part of a careful two-pronged strategy .
it is an image the party has assiduously tried to build over the years .
mr advani 's decisiveness has been contrasted by the bjp in the run-up to this campaign with the character of congress leader and prime minister manmohan singh , who has been portrayed as a weak man constantly in deference to the party president , sonia gandhi .
but as the election campaign gathers heat and momentum mr advani has been keen to take the debate away from personalities to issues .
so during our nearly one-hour conversation this time he chose not to attack the prime minister by name even once .
the bjp leader chose to concentrate on what he described as the failures of the congress-led coalition .
anti-muslim image " there is not even one success which i can credit to this government .
i ca n't think of any other government in my 60 years of public life which ca n't boast of even one achievement .
the destruction of the babri mosque has dogged mr advani " all that this government has done is run to the usa each time india is in trouble .
even post 26/11 -lrb- the mumbai terror attack -rrb- all the pressure was exerted on pakistan by the west , particularly the usa .
" washington is this government 's police station and they run at the smallest pretext to register their complaint there . "
mr advani was keen to shrug of his anti-muslim image .
not an easy task considering the bjp leader has always been seen as a hardliner .
he shot to prominence by launching and leading a controversial campaign for the construction of a lord ram temple in the northern indian town of ayodhya which resulted in the demolition of the 16th century babri mosque there .
but in recent years mr advani has attempted to seek an image makeover .
he all but lost the chance to lead his party in this year 's election campaign when a couple of years ago - during a much publicised visit to pakistan - he showered praise on mohammad ali jinnah , pakistan 's founder and certainly not a very popular figure among the hindu right in india .
mr advani was roundly criticised for his positive remarks on jinnah .
his party virtually disowned him and for a brief while it looked as if it was curtains on the bjp leader 's public life .
retirement " but the party soon appreciated i had said nothing wrong .
ours is a democratic party and once the leadership realised its mistake we made amends . "
lk advani 's comments during a visit to jinnah 's mausoleum sparked a furore mr advani may not like to dwell too much on intra-bjp tensions but it 's clear that he firmly believes that the jinnah episode was a turning point in his relationship with muslims .
" nowhere was i perceived as an enemy more than in pakistan .
but after my visit and my comments on jinnah , my image in pakistan has completely changed .
i am now seen by them as a friend .
" it 's only a matter of time before indian muslims also realise that certain parties have exploited their mistrust for the bjp by instilling a sense of fear in them .
i am sure muslims will soon see that their welfare is best served by the bjp . "
mr advani said he was optimistic about his party doing well in these elections .
" we should be able to form the government . "
it 's always difficult to tell , but he appeared to sound a bit hesitant making these bold assertions .
certainly he did not have the swagger of a sure-fire winner .
but then to be fair to him it 's difficult to find one leader who projects that kind of confidence in indian elections .
so will this be his last election if he loses ?
considering he is in his eighties , will he contemplate retirement if his party does not form the government ?
" why should i ? " this veteran politician responds defiantly .
" out of my 60 years in public life , only eight have been in power .
i never feel that i am not doing anything constructive if i am out of power .
we will sit in the opposition .
" my only wish is that i am still healthy whenever i decide to opt out of active public life .
that will be a good way to go . "
