the move is being widely welcomed . in a late change to his schedule , the white house announced that the president would be attending the latter portion of the talks in copenhagen , rather than the opening ceremonies .
the decision was warmly welcomed by attendees and hosts alike .
the copenhagen climate change conference is expecting to host 103 world leaders and result in meaningful international agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gases .
obama 's initial plan , to attend the talks on december 9 before heading to oslo to receive his nobel peace prize , had been greeted with some consternation from other conference delegates and environmentalists .
the us president now intends to attend the final day of the conference on december 18 .
most of the hard bargaining and consensus-making is expected to occur at the end of the conference when many other world leaders are expected to attend .
a symbolic schedule change the us government said the president 's change of plan was " based on his conversations with other leaders and the progress that has already been made to give momentum to negotiations . "
the news was welcomed by french president nicholas sarkozy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen was pleased by the news sarkozy " is delighted at this decision which shows the importance attached by the united states to the success of this conference on the climate , " a statement from his office said .
denmark 's prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , whose country is hosting the conference , attributed the change to " the growing political momentum to reach an ambitious climate deal in copenhagen . "
" president obama 's strong focus on climate change and his global leadership are key for the copenhagen talks , " rasmussen said .
germany 's environment minister , too , found the news symbolic .
" this is a clear signal , " nortbert röttgen told the german newspaper bild .
" obama wants the conference to succeed , and he is putting all the weight of his personality into the equation , " he said. sjt / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .
dortmund romps nuremburg the first goal of the match in dortmund from kevin grosskreutz in the eighth minute would have been enough to keep visiting nuremburg at bay .
but dortmund steadily added to its lead with strikes from lucas barrios -lrb- 13th minute -rrb- , mohamed zidan -lrb- 36th -rrb- , and mats hummels -lrb- 61st -rrb- for a final score of 4-0 .
the loss pushes nuremburg further into the basement in the bundesliga , where they now occupy the second-to-last position .
coming into the weekend , that spot belonged to vfb stuttgart , who were denied their first win in eight matches in the closing minutes of their home game against bochum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel could have used a win to restore confidence in stuttgart stuttgart defender serdar tasci put the home side in front in the 63rd minute , and it looked like the one goal would be enough to secure the three points for markus babbel 's struggling side .
but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .
" we had been playing with a lot of concentration particularly in the second half so it was particularly disappointing to concede the goal . "

defender maik franz put frankfurt ahead in the first half , and midfielder alexander meier added another for good measure just as time expired in the 90th minute .
hamburg and hoffenheim played to a 0-0 draw in hamburg .
freiburg blew a chance at an upset over defending bundesliga champions wolfsburg thanks to an own goal via a header from felix bastians in the 27th minute .
freiburg had taken the lead in the 19th minute on a strike from mohamadou idrissou .
a penalty in the 51st minute from midfielder ivica banovic gave visiting freiburg the lead again , but wolfsburg set the final score of 2-2 in the 81st minute after a lofting shot from midfielder fabian johnson. mz / dpa / afp editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , the artworks will be housed in a new design by david chipperfield . three years ago , essen 's renowned museum folkwang was bursting at the seams , so the alfried krupp von bohlen and halbach foundation offered funding for a new museum .
a competition began , and the uk 's david chipperfield won the bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cezanne exhibition drew huge crowds to museum folkwang while the museum 's collection wo n't be moved into the building until january , chipperfield has already unveiled his design for the museum 's new building . it will be a space of simple grace - no formal twists and turns , no " wow " -effects , which the architect dislikes anyway . up , up , and away instead , the design is pure lightness of being , full of flowing transitions between three simple box-like structures .
the structures ' shimmering , bright green color gives the design a friendly feel and the large glass surfaces of the facade allow in copious amount of light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kreidefelsen auf ruegen " by caspar david friedrich , 1818 green courtyards link the three structures to one another , as well as to the museum folkwang building dating from the 1950s . there is another museum building built in the 1980s , but it was never well liked by the public . " there was such a dislike of the 80s building , the 50s building had generated a certain amount of affection , " david chipperfield said . so the 80s-era museum was done away with while the building from the 50s was integrated into his design . " it 's very direct , it 's absolutely simple , it 's quite transparent , " he went on .
" you can see from the outside inside and from inside you see outside , so it seemed to us that there was a certain dna in the building that could be borrowed . " bildunterschrift : chipperfield also redesigned berlin 's " new museum " views all around the glass facades allow for views on all sides - a charming villa in one direction , an ugly apartment building from the 60s in another . despite the structure 's simplicity , it still has something labyrinthine about it .
whether or not visitors will be able to find their way around easily will reveal itself in january , when the museum 's permanent collection moves in . that collection includes graphic art , photography , paintings and sculptures by vincent van gogh , paul cezanne , paul gauguin , henri matisse , and a host of other world-famous artists . author : beatrix novy -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 05.12.2009 should the eu have taken the road to damascus sooner ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's move took brussels by surprise relations between the eu and syria have warmed considerably of late .
however , a partnership deal remains on hold after damascus delayed signing the accord .
deutsche welle asked experts about the implications . as part of the syria 's continuing international rehabilitation , eu diplomats were poised recently to put their pen to an association agreement with the previously isolated regime .
the accord would have brought the country into the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- .
member states had agreed it was time to engage in dialog with a country that is recognized as a key player in the middle east because of its role in lebanon and iraq , its relationship with iran and , as the base of hamas , its influence on palestinian politics .
under the association agreement , syria would have gained financial and trade incentives in exchange for commitments to political and economic reforms .
president bashar al-assad 's insistence that damascus must first review the document has clearly taken brussels aback .
syria shows its displeasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has association agreements with many countries in the region middle east expert muriel asseburg is less surprised .
“ this is a tit-for-tat reaction .
the european has reopened negotiations and dragged its feet with regards to the agreement on three occasions in the past , ” asseburg , who is head of the middle east africa division at the stiftung wissenschaft und politik -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin , told deutsche welle .
damascus and the eu drew up their first draft partnership pact back in 2004 .
however , it subsequently hit a number of snags because of opposition from some eu member states .
despite syria accepting an additional clause in 2004 about weapons of mass destruction after pressure from states such as britain , the accord was never signed and remained on ice until 2008 . the lowpoint of bilateral relations came in 2005 when the eu froze relations with damascus in 2005 after the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri .
syria was widely blamed for orchestrating the killing , although it denies any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria was believed to be behind the assassination of rafik hariri .
this year , eu states agreed to move toward a deal after appending a 1,000 page memorandum of understanding to the agreement at dutch behest .
it would allow the eu to suspend relations with syria in the event of human rights violations . " the syrians are annoyed because the eu has politicized negotiations and imposed the most stringent conditions with regards to weapons of mass destruction and human rights of all upon them .
they want to make clear that they are not prepared to eat humble pie , ” said asseburg .
at present , europe has association agreements with all other countries in the region , apart from libya .
there have been numerous human rights abuses in many of them and yet no serious move has been made to terminate these accords , leaving the eu open to charges of double standards . temporary setback ?
whether assad 's decision not to sign the deal is just a temporary blip , or a more serious setback is not yet clear , according to clara o-donnell , a research fellow at the centre for european reform -lrb- cef -rrb- .
“ it could be a short-term issue .
it could be quite legitimate .
they might just want to time to go through this very long document .
or syria could want to stall as part of a long-term trend , ” she told deutsche welle .
second-guessing what is going on inside this secretive , authoritarian regime is extremely difficult , according to thomas richter , research fellow at the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
“ you ca n't look in .
it 's like a big black box .
even for people like us who are concerned with the country on a daily basis . ”
richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .
but he does not expect short-term results .
too little , too late ?
while the european union may now have reached a common position on how it would like to proceed towards syria , damascus has not been standing still in the meantime .
“ you could say the eu has missed the boat in some respects , " said swp expert asseburg .
“ over the last few years , syria has diversified its foreign relations - not only deepening them with iran , but also developing closer links with turkey and some asian states , such as malaysia . ”
this means that the eu now has less scope to shape relations with syria and influence developments there , according to asseburg .
“ the eu was too slow because there was no consensus among the member states about how to treat syria , ” she said .
the country 's status as a transit land for islamist militants and foreign fighters entering iraq and lebanon makes it an important partner for the west .
while germany and italy have been pressing for a policy of dialog for some time , there was more reluctance , at times , from britain , the netherlands and france .
us pips europe to the post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is also reframing us policy toward the muslim world the shift in policy under the obama administration also means that syria is less interested in europe than they were a few years ago .
although us sanctions are still in force against syria , the new us president has indicated his intention to return an ambassador to the country .
as a negotiator in the middle east peace process , the united states clearly carry more weight than the eu . against this background , richter sees assad 's veto of the association agreement as a possible negotiating strategy to win more concessions from the eu .
resistance to the accord could also come from elements within the bureaucracy who see its economic reforms as a threat to their commercial monopolies . while the giga expert believes it is " regrettable " that the eu might have missed certain chances because of the protracted negotiations with syria , he attributes it , in part , to the unwieldy nature of the bloc .
“ it is incredibly difficult to coordinate foreign policy .
other states are more efficient in that respect , ” he added .
but has the eu really exhausted all its possibilities ?
clara o 'donnell thinks not . the european union is syria 's biggest trading partner and could possibly play a stronger role if it made more use of its economic leverage , the cef researcher believes .
“ if it were to beef up its incentives it would have more traction , ” she said .
the offer of improved visa facilitation and more access to eu 's agriculture market might be two policies that could give the eu more bargaining power in the region as a whole , according to o 'donnell .

however , a partnership deal remains on hold after damascus delayed signing the accord .
deutsche welle asked experts about the implications . as part of the syria 's continuing international rehabilitation , eu diplomats were poised recently to put their pen to an association agreement with the previously isolated regime .
the accord would have brought the country into the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- .
member states had agreed it was time to engage in dialog with a country that is recognized as a key player in the middle east because of its role in lebanon and iraq , its relationship with iran and , as the base of hamas , its influence on palestinian politics .
under the association agreement , syria would have gained financial and trade incentives in exchange for commitments to political and economic reforms .
president bashar al-assad 's insistence that damascus must first review the document has clearly taken brussels aback .
syria shows its displeasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has association agreements with many countries in the region middle east expert muriel asseburg is less surprised .
“ this is a tit-for-tat reaction .
the european has reopened negotiations and dragged its feet with regards to the agreement on three occasions in the past , ” asseburg , who is head of the middle east africa division at the stiftung wissenschaft und politik -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin , told deutsche welle .
damascus and the eu drew up their first draft partnership pact back in 2004 .
however , it subsequently hit a number of snags because of opposition from some eu member states .
despite syria accepting an additional clause in 2004 about weapons of mass destruction after pressure from states such as britain , the accord was never signed and remained on ice until 2008 . the lowpoint of bilateral relations came in 2005 when the eu froze relations with damascus in 2005 after the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri .
syria was widely blamed for orchestrating the killing , although it denies any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria was believed to be behind the assassination of rafik hariri .
this year , eu states agreed to move toward a deal after appending a 1,000 page memorandum of understanding to the agreement at dutch behest .
it would allow the eu to suspend relations with syria in the event of human rights violations . " the syrians are annoyed because the eu has politicized negotiations and imposed the most stringent conditions with regards to weapons of mass destruction and human rights of all upon them .
they want to make clear that they are not prepared to eat humble pie , ” said asseburg .
at present , europe has association agreements with all other countries in the region , apart from libya .
there have been numerous human rights abuses in many of them and yet no serious move has been made to terminate these accords , leaving the eu open to charges of double standards . temporary setback ?
whether assad 's decision not to sign the deal is just a temporary blip , or a more serious setback is not yet clear , according to clara o-donnell , a research fellow at the centre for european reform -lrb- cef -rrb- .
“ it could be a short-term issue .
it could be quite legitimate .
they might just want to time to go through this very long document .
or syria could want to stall as part of a long-term trend , ” she told deutsche welle .
second-guessing what is going on inside this secretive , authoritarian regime is extremely difficult , according to thomas richter , research fellow at the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
“ you ca n't look in .
it 's like a big black box .
even for people like us who are concerned with the country on a daily basis . ”
richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .
but he does not expect short-term results .
too little , too late ?
while the european union may now have reached a common position on how it would like to proceed towards syria , damascus has not been standing still in the meantime .
“ you could say the eu has missed the boat in some respects , " said swp expert asseburg .
“ over the last few years , syria has diversified its foreign relations - not only deepening them with iran , but also developing closer links with turkey and some asian states , such as malaysia . ”
this means that the eu now has less scope to shape relations with syria and influence developments there , according to asseburg .
“ the eu was too slow because there was no consensus among the member states about how to treat syria , ” she said .
the country 's status as a transit land for islamist militants and foreign fighters entering iraq and lebanon makes it an important partner for the west .
while germany and italy have been pressing for a policy of dialog for some time , there was more reluctance , at times , from britain , the netherlands and france .
us pips europe to the post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is also reframing us policy toward the muslim world the shift in policy under the obama administration also means that syria is less interested in europe than they were a few years ago .
although us sanctions are still in force against syria , the new us president has indicated his intention to return an ambassador to the country .
as a negotiator in the middle east peace process , the united states clearly carry more weight than the eu . against this background , richter sees assad 's veto of the association agreement as a possible negotiating strategy to win more concessions from the eu .
resistance to the accord could also come from elements within the bureaucracy who see its economic reforms as a threat to their commercial monopolies . while the giga expert believes it is " regrettable " that the eu might have missed certain chances because of the protracted negotiations with syria , he attributes it , in part , to the unwieldy nature of the bloc .
“ it is incredibly difficult to coordinate foreign policy .
other states are more efficient in that respect , ” he added .
but has the eu really exhausted all its possibilities ?
clara o 'donnell thinks not . the european union is syria 's biggest trading partner and could possibly play a stronger role if it made more use of its economic leverage , the cef researcher believes .
“ if it were to beef up its incentives it would have more traction , ” she said .
the offer of improved visa facilitation and more access to eu 's agriculture market might be two policies that could give the eu more bargaining power in the region as a whole , according to o 'donnell .

however , a partnership deal remains on hold after damascus delayed signing the accord .
deutsche welle asked experts about the implications . as part of the syria 's continuing international rehabilitation , eu diplomats were poised recently to put their pen to an association agreement with the previously isolated regime .
the accord would have brought the country into the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- .
member states had agreed it was time to engage in dialog with a country that is recognized as a key player in the middle east because of its role in lebanon and iraq , its relationship with iran and , as the base of hamas , its influence on palestinian politics .
under the association agreement , syria would have gained financial and trade incentives in exchange for commitments to political and economic reforms .
president bashar al-assad 's insistence that damascus must first review the document has clearly taken brussels aback .
syria shows its displeasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has association agreements with many countries in the region middle east expert muriel asseburg is less surprised .
“ this is a tit-for-tat reaction .
the european has reopened negotiations and dragged its feet with regards to the agreement on three occasions in the past , ” asseburg , who is head of the middle east africa division at the stiftung wissenschaft und politik -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin , told deutsche welle .
damascus and the eu drew up their first draft partnership pact back in 2004 .
however , it subsequently hit a number of snags because of opposition from some eu member states .
despite syria accepting an additional clause in 2004 about weapons of mass destruction after pressure from states such as britain , the accord was never signed and remained on ice until 2008 . the lowpoint of bilateral relations came in 2005 when the eu froze relations with damascus in 2005 after the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri .
syria was widely blamed for orchestrating the killing , although it denies any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria was believed to be behind the assassination of rafik hariri .
this year , eu states agreed to move toward a deal after appending a 1,000 page memorandum of understanding to the agreement at dutch behest .
it would allow the eu to suspend relations with syria in the event of human rights violations . " the syrians are annoyed because the eu has politicized negotiations and imposed the most stringent conditions with regards to weapons of mass destruction and human rights of all upon them .
they want to make clear that they are not prepared to eat humble pie , ” said asseburg .

richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .

“ you could say the eu has missed the boat in some respects , " said swp expert asseburg .
“ over the last few years , syria has diversified its foreign relations - not only deepening them with iran , but also developing closer links with turkey and some asian states , such as malaysia . ”
this means that the eu now has less scope to shape relations with syria and influence developments there , according to asseburg .
“ the eu was too slow because there was no consensus among the member states about how to treat syria , ” she said .
the country 's status as a transit land for islamist militants and foreign fighters entering iraq and lebanon makes it an important partner for the west .

although us sanctions are still in force against syria , the new us president has indicated his intention to return an ambassador to the country .
as a negotiator in the middle east peace process , the united states clearly carry more weight than the eu . against this background , richter sees assad 's veto of the association agreement as a possible negotiating strategy to win more concessions from the eu .
resistance to the accord could also come from elements within the bureaucracy who see its economic reforms as a threat to their commercial monopolies . while the giga expert believes it is " regrettable " that the eu might have missed certain chances because of the protracted negotiations with syria , he attributes it , in part , to the unwieldy nature of the bloc .
“ it is incredibly difficult to coordinate foreign policy .
other states are more efficient in that respect , ” he added .
but has the eu really exhausted all its possibilities ?
clara o 'donnell thinks not . the european union is syria 's biggest trading partner and could possibly play a stronger role if it made more use of its economic leverage , the cef researcher believes .
“ if it were to beef up its incentives it would have more traction , ” she said .
the offer of improved visa facilitation and more access to eu 's agriculture market might be two policies that could give the eu more bargaining power in the region as a whole , according to o 'donnell .

however , a partnership deal remains on hold after damascus delayed signing the accord .
deutsche welle asked experts about the implications . as part of the syria 's continuing international rehabilitation , eu diplomats were poised recently to put their pen to an association agreement with the previously isolated regime .
the accord would have brought the country into the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- .
member states had agreed it was time to engage in dialog with a country that is recognized as a key player in the middle east because of its role in lebanon and iraq , its relationship with iran and , as the base of hamas , its influence on palestinian politics .
under the association agreement , syria would have gained financial and trade incentives in exchange for commitments to political and economic reforms .
president bashar al-assad 's insistence that damascus must first review the document has clearly taken brussels aback .
syria shows its displeasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has association agreements with many countries in the region middle east expert muriel asseburg is less surprised .
“ this is a tit-for-tat reaction .
the european has reopened negotiations and dragged its feet with regards to the agreement on three occasions in the past , ” asseburg , who is head of the middle east africa division at the stiftung wissenschaft und politik -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin , told deutsche welle .
damascus and the eu drew up their first draft partnership pact back in 2004 .
however , it subsequently hit a number of snags because of opposition from some eu member states .
despite syria accepting an additional clause in 2004 about weapons of mass destruction after pressure from states such as britain , the accord was never signed and remained on ice until 2008 . the lowpoint of bilateral relations came in 2005 when the eu froze relations with damascus in 2005 after the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri .
syria was widely blamed for orchestrating the killing , although it denies any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria was believed to be behind the assassination of rafik hariri .
this year , eu states agreed to move toward a deal after appending a 1,000 page memorandum of understanding to the agreement at dutch behest .
it would allow the eu to suspend relations with syria in the event of human rights violations . " the syrians are annoyed because the eu has politicized negotiations and imposed the most stringent conditions with regards to weapons of mass destruction and human rights of all upon them .
they want to make clear that they are not prepared to eat humble pie , ” said asseburg .
at present , europe has association agreements with all other countries in the region , apart from libya .
there have been numerous human rights abuses in many of them and yet no serious move has been made to terminate these accords , leaving the eu open to charges of double standards . temporary setback ?
whether assad 's decision not to sign the deal is just a temporary blip , or a more serious setback is not yet clear , according to clara o-donnell , a research fellow at the centre for european reform -lrb- cef -rrb- .
“ it could be a short-term issue .
it could be quite legitimate .
they might just want to time to go through this very long document .
or syria could want to stall as part of a long-term trend , ” she told deutsche welle .
second-guessing what is going on inside this secretive , authoritarian regime is extremely difficult , according to thomas richter , research fellow at the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
“ you ca n't look in .
it 's like a big black box .
even for people like us who are concerned with the country on a daily basis . ”
richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .
but he does not expect short-term results .
too little , too late ?
while the european union may now have reached a common position on how it would like to proceed towards syria , damascus has not been standing still in the meantime .
“ you could say the eu has missed the boat in some respects , " said swp expert asseburg .
“ over the last few years , syria has diversified its foreign relations - not only deepening them with iran , but also developing closer links with turkey and some asian states , such as malaysia . ”
this means that the eu now has less scope to shape relations with syria and influence developments there , according to asseburg .
“ the eu was too slow because there was no consensus among the member states about how to treat syria , ” she said .
the country 's status as a transit land for islamist militants and foreign fighters entering iraq and lebanon makes it an important partner for the west .
while germany and italy have been pressing for a policy of dialog for some time , there was more reluctance , at times , from britain , the netherlands and france .

however , a partnership deal remains on hold after damascus delayed signing the accord .
deutsche welle asked experts about the implications . as part of the syria 's continuing international rehabilitation , eu diplomats were poised recently to put their pen to an association agreement with the previously isolated regime .
the accord would have brought the country into the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- .
member states had agreed it was time to engage in dialog with a country that is recognized as a key player in the middle east because of its role in lebanon and iraq , its relationship with iran and , as the base of hamas , its influence on palestinian politics .
under the association agreement , syria would have gained financial and trade incentives in exchange for commitments to political and economic reforms .
president bashar al-assad 's insistence that damascus must first review the document has clearly taken brussels aback .
syria shows its displeasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has association agreements with many countries in the region middle east expert muriel asseburg is less surprised .
“ this is a tit-for-tat reaction .
the european has reopened negotiations and dragged its feet with regards to the agreement on three occasions in the past , ” asseburg , who is head of the middle east africa division at the stiftung wissenschaft und politik -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin , told deutsche welle .
damascus and the eu drew up their first draft partnership pact back in 2004 .
however , it subsequently hit a number of snags because of opposition from some eu member states .
despite syria accepting an additional clause in 2004 about weapons of mass destruction after pressure from states such as britain , the accord was never signed and remained on ice until 2008 . the lowpoint of bilateral relations came in 2005 when the eu froze relations with damascus in 2005 after the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri .
syria was widely blamed for orchestrating the killing , although it denies any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria was believed to be behind the assassination of rafik hariri .
this year , eu states agreed to move toward a deal after appending a 1,000 page memorandum of understanding to the agreement at dutch behest .
it would allow the eu to suspend relations with syria in the event of human rights violations . " the syrians are annoyed because the eu has politicized negotiations and imposed the most stringent conditions with regards to weapons of mass destruction and human rights of all upon them .
they want to make clear that they are not prepared to eat humble pie , ” said asseburg .
at present , europe has association agreements with all other countries in the region , apart from libya .
there have been numerous human rights abuses in many of them and yet no serious move has been made to terminate these accords , leaving the eu open to charges of double standards . temporary setback ?
whether assad 's decision not to sign the deal is just a temporary blip , or a more serious setback is not yet clear , according to clara o-donnell , a research fellow at the centre for european reform -lrb- cef -rrb- .
“ it could be a short-term issue .
it could be quite legitimate .
they might just want to time to go through this very long document .
or syria could want to stall as part of a long-term trend , ” she told deutsche welle .
second-guessing what is going on inside this secretive , authoritarian regime is extremely difficult , according to thomas richter , research fellow at the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
“ you ca n't look in .
it 's like a big black box .
even for people like us who are concerned with the country on a daily basis . ”
richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .
but he does not expect short-term results .
too little , too late ?
while the european union may now have reached a common position on how it would like to proceed towards syria , damascus has not been standing still in the meantime .
“ you could say the eu has missed the boat in some respects , " said swp expert asseburg .
“ over the last few years , syria has diversified its foreign relations - not only deepening them with iran , but also developing closer links with turkey and some asian states , such as malaysia . ”
this means that the eu now has less scope to shape relations with syria and influence developments there , according to asseburg .
“ the eu was too slow because there was no consensus among the member states about how to treat syria , ” she said .
the country 's status as a transit land for islamist militants and foreign fighters entering iraq and lebanon makes it an important partner for the west .
while germany and italy have been pressing for a policy of dialog for some time , there was more reluctance , at times , from britain , the netherlands and france .
us pips europe to the post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is also reframing us policy toward the muslim world the shift in policy under the obama administration also means that syria is less interested in europe than they were a few years ago .
although us sanctions are still in force against syria , the new us president has indicated his intention to return an ambassador to the country .
as a negotiator in the middle east peace process , the united states clearly carry more weight than the eu . against this background , richter sees assad 's veto of the association agreement as a possible negotiating strategy to win more concessions from the eu .
resistance to the accord could also come from elements within the bureaucracy who see its economic reforms as a threat to their commercial monopolies . while the giga expert believes it is " regrettable " that the eu might have missed certain chances because of the protracted negotiations with syria , he attributes it , in part , to the unwieldy nature of the bloc .
“ it is incredibly difficult to coordinate foreign policy .
other states are more efficient in that respect , ” he added .
but has the eu really exhausted all its possibilities ?
clara o 'donnell thinks not . the european union is syria 's biggest trading partner and could possibly play a stronger role if it made more use of its economic leverage , the cef researcher believes .
“ if it were to beef up its incentives it would have more traction , ” she said .
the offer of improved visa facilitation and more access to eu 's agriculture market might be two policies that could give the eu more bargaining power in the region as a whole , according to o 'donnell .

richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .

“ you could say the eu has missed the boat in some respects , " said swp expert asseburg .
“ over the last few years , syria has diversified its foreign relations - not only deepening them with iran , but also developing closer links with turkey and some asian states , such as malaysia . ”
this means that the eu now has less scope to shape relations with syria and influence developments there , according to asseburg .
“ the eu was too slow because there was no consensus among the member states about how to treat syria , ” she said .
the country 's status as a transit land for islamist militants and foreign fighters entering iraq and lebanon makes it an important partner for the west .
while germany and italy have been pressing for a policy of dialog for some time , there was more reluctance , at times , from britain , the netherlands and france .
us pips europe to the post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is also reframing us policy toward the muslim world the shift in policy under the obama administration also means that syria is less interested in europe than they were a few years ago .
although us sanctions are still in force against syria , the new us president has indicated his intention to return an ambassador to the country .
as a negotiator in the middle east peace process , the united states clearly carry more weight than the eu . against this background , richter sees assad 's veto of the association agreement as a possible negotiating strategy to win more concessions from the eu .
resistance to the accord could also come from elements within the bureaucracy who see its economic reforms as a threat to their commercial monopolies . while the giga expert believes it is " regrettable " that the eu might have missed certain chances because of the protracted negotiations with syria , he attributes it , in part , to the unwieldy nature of the bloc .
“ it is incredibly difficult to coordinate foreign policy .
other states are more efficient in that respect , ” he added .
but has the eu really exhausted all its possibilities ?
clara o 'donnell thinks not . the european union is syria 's biggest trading partner and could possibly play a stronger role if it made more use of its economic leverage , the cef researcher believes .
“ if it were to beef up its incentives it would have more traction , ” she said .
the offer of improved visa facilitation and more access to eu 's agriculture market might be two policies that could give the eu more bargaining power in the region as a whole , according to o 'donnell .

however , a partnership deal remains on hold after damascus delayed signing the accord .
deutsche welle asked experts about the implications . as part of the syria 's continuing international rehabilitation , eu diplomats were poised recently to put their pen to an association agreement with the previously isolated regime .
the accord would have brought the country into the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- .
member states had agreed it was time to engage in dialog with a country that is recognized as a key player in the middle east because of its role in lebanon and iraq , its relationship with iran and , as the base of hamas , its influence on palestinian politics .
under the association agreement , syria would have gained financial and trade incentives in exchange for commitments to political and economic reforms .
president bashar al-assad 's insistence that damascus must first review the document has clearly taken brussels aback .
syria shows its displeasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has association agreements with many countries in the region middle east expert muriel asseburg is less surprised .
“ this is a tit-for-tat reaction .
the european has reopened negotiations and dragged its feet with regards to the agreement on three occasions in the past , ” asseburg , who is head of the middle east africa division at the stiftung wissenschaft und politik -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin , told deutsche welle .
damascus and the eu drew up their first draft partnership pact back in 2004 .
however , it subsequently hit a number of snags because of opposition from some eu member states .
despite syria accepting an additional clause in 2004 about weapons of mass destruction after pressure from states such as britain , the accord was never signed and remained on ice until 2008 . the lowpoint of bilateral relations came in 2005 when the eu froze relations with damascus in 2005 after the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri .
syria was widely blamed for orchestrating the killing , although it denies any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria was believed to be behind the assassination of rafik hariri .
this year , eu states agreed to move toward a deal after appending a 1,000 page memorandum of understanding to the agreement at dutch behest .
it would allow the eu to suspend relations with syria in the event of human rights violations . " the syrians are annoyed because the eu has politicized negotiations and imposed the most stringent conditions with regards to weapons of mass destruction and human rights of all upon them .
they want to make clear that they are not prepared to eat humble pie , ” said asseburg .
at present , europe has association agreements with all other countries in the region , apart from libya .
there have been numerous human rights abuses in many of them and yet no serious move has been made to terminate these accords , leaving the eu open to charges of double standards . temporary setback ?
whether assad 's decision not to sign the deal is just a temporary blip , or a more serious setback is not yet clear , according to clara o-donnell , a research fellow at the centre for european reform -lrb- cef -rrb- .
“ it could be a short-term issue .
it could be quite legitimate .
they might just want to time to go through this very long document .
or syria could want to stall as part of a long-term trend , ” she told deutsche welle .
second-guessing what is going on inside this secretive , authoritarian regime is extremely difficult , according to thomas richter , research fellow at the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
“ you ca n't look in .
it 's like a big black box .
even for people like us who are concerned with the country on a daily basis . ”
richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .
but he does not expect short-term results .
too little , too late ?
while the european union may now have reached a common position on how it would like to proceed towards syria , damascus has not been standing still in the meantime .
“ you could say the eu has missed the boat in some respects , " said swp expert asseburg .
“ over the last few years , syria has diversified its foreign relations - not only deepening them with iran , but also developing closer links with turkey and some asian states , such as malaysia . ”
this means that the eu now has less scope to shape relations with syria and influence developments there , according to asseburg .
“ the eu was too slow because there was no consensus among the member states about how to treat syria , ” she said .
the country 's status as a transit land for islamist militants and foreign fighters entering iraq and lebanon makes it an important partner for the west .
while germany and italy have been pressing for a policy of dialog for some time , there was more reluctance , at times , from britain , the netherlands and france .
us pips europe to the post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is also reframing us policy toward the muslim world the shift in policy under the obama administration also means that syria is less interested in europe than they were a few years ago .
although us sanctions are still in force against syria , the new us president has indicated his intention to return an ambassador to the country .
as a negotiator in the middle east peace process , the united states clearly carry more weight than the eu . against this background , richter sees assad 's veto of the association agreement as a possible negotiating strategy to win more concessions from the eu .
resistance to the accord could also come from elements within the bureaucracy who see its economic reforms as a threat to their commercial monopolies . while the giga expert believes it is " regrettable " that the eu might have missed certain chances because of the protracted negotiations with syria , he attributes it , in part , to the unwieldy nature of the bloc .
“ it is incredibly difficult to coordinate foreign policy .
other states are more efficient in that respect , ” he added .
but has the eu really exhausted all its possibilities ?
clara o 'donnell thinks not . the european union is syria 's biggest trading partner and could possibly play a stronger role if it made more use of its economic leverage , the cef researcher believes .
“ if it were to beef up its incentives it would have more traction , ” she said .

member states had agreed it was time to engage in dialog with a country that is recognized as a key player in the middle east because of its role in lebanon and iraq , its relationship with iran and , as the base of hamas , its influence on palestinian politics .
under the association agreement , syria would have gained financial and trade incentives in exchange for commitments to political and economic reforms .
president bashar al-assad 's insistence that damascus must first review the document has clearly taken brussels aback .
syria shows its displeasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has association agreements with many countries in the region middle east expert muriel asseburg is less surprised .
“ this is a tit-for-tat reaction .
the european has reopened negotiations and dragged its feet with regards to the agreement on three occasions in the past , ” asseburg , who is head of the middle east africa division at the stiftung wissenschaft und politik -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin , told deutsche welle .
damascus and the eu drew up their first draft partnership pact back in 2004 .
however , it subsequently hit a number of snags because of opposition from some eu member states .
despite syria accepting an additional clause in 2004 about weapons of mass destruction after pressure from states such as britain , the accord was never signed and remained on ice until 2008 . the lowpoint of bilateral relations came in 2005 when the eu froze relations with damascus in 2005 after the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri .
syria was widely blamed for orchestrating the killing , although it denies any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria was believed to be behind the assassination of rafik hariri .
this year , eu states agreed to move toward a deal after appending a 1,000 page memorandum of understanding to the agreement at dutch behest .
it would allow the eu to suspend relations with syria in the event of human rights violations . " the syrians are annoyed because the eu has politicized negotiations and imposed the most stringent conditions with regards to weapons of mass destruction and human rights of all upon them .
they want to make clear that they are not prepared to eat humble pie , ” said asseburg .
at present , europe has association agreements with all other countries in the region , apart from libya .
there have been numerous human rights abuses in many of them and yet no serious move has been made to terminate these accords , leaving the eu open to charges of double standards . temporary setback ?
whether assad 's decision not to sign the deal is just a temporary blip , or a more serious setback is not yet clear , according to clara o-donnell , a research fellow at the centre for european reform -lrb- cef -rrb- .
“ it could be a short-term issue .
it could be quite legitimate .
they might just want to time to go through this very long document .
or syria could want to stall as part of a long-term trend , ” she told deutsche welle .
second-guessing what is going on inside this secretive , authoritarian regime is extremely difficult , according to thomas richter , research fellow at the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
“ you ca n't look in .
it 's like a big black box .
even for people like us who are concerned with the country on a daily basis . ”
richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .
but he does not expect short-term results .
too little , too late ?
while the european union may now have reached a common position on how it would like to proceed towards syria , damascus has not been standing still in the meantime .
“ you could say the eu has missed the boat in some respects , " said swp expert asseburg .
“ over the last few years , syria has diversified its foreign relations - not only deepening them with iran , but also developing closer links with turkey and some asian states , such as malaysia . ”
this means that the eu now has less scope to shape relations with syria and influence developments there , according to asseburg .
“ the eu was too slow because there was no consensus among the member states about how to treat syria , ” she said .
the country 's status as a transit land for islamist militants and foreign fighters entering iraq and lebanon makes it an important partner for the west .
while germany and italy have been pressing for a policy of dialog for some time , there was more reluctance , at times , from britain , the netherlands and france .
us pips europe to the post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is also reframing us policy toward the muslim world the shift in policy under the obama administration also means that syria is less interested in europe than they were a few years ago .
although us sanctions are still in force against syria , the new us president has indicated his intention to return an ambassador to the country .
as a negotiator in the middle east peace process , the united states clearly carry more weight than the eu . against this background , richter sees assad 's veto of the association agreement as a possible negotiating strategy to win more concessions from the eu .
resistance to the accord could also come from elements within the bureaucracy who see its economic reforms as a threat to their commercial monopolies . while the giga expert believes it is " regrettable " that the eu might have missed certain chances because of the protracted negotiations with syria , he attributes it , in part , to the unwieldy nature of the bloc .
“ it is incredibly difficult to coordinate foreign policy .
other states are more efficient in that respect , ” he added .
but has the eu really exhausted all its possibilities ?
clara o 'donnell thinks not . the european union is syria 's biggest trading partner and could possibly play a stronger role if it made more use of its economic leverage , the cef researcher believes .
“ if it were to beef up its incentives it would have more traction , ” she said .
the offer of improved visa facilitation and more access to eu 's agriculture market might be two policies that could give the eu more bargaining power in the region as a whole , according to o 'donnell .

however , a partnership deal remains on hold after damascus delayed signing the accord .
deutsche welle asked experts about the implications . as part of the syria 's continuing international rehabilitation , eu diplomats were poised recently to put their pen to an association agreement with the previously isolated regime .
the accord would have brought the country into the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- .
member states had agreed it was time to engage in dialog with a country that is recognized as a key player in the middle east because of its role in lebanon and iraq , its relationship with iran and , as the base of hamas , its influence on palestinian politics .
under the association agreement , syria would have gained financial and trade incentives in exchange for commitments to political and economic reforms .
president bashar al-assad 's insistence that damascus must first review the document has clearly taken brussels aback .
syria shows its displeasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has association agreements with many countries in the region middle east expert muriel asseburg is less surprised .
“ this is a tit-for-tat reaction .
the european has reopened negotiations and dragged its feet with regards to the agreement on three occasions in the past , ” asseburg , who is head of the middle east africa division at the stiftung wissenschaft und politik -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin , told deutsche welle .
damascus and the eu drew up their first draft partnership pact back in 2004 .
however , it subsequently hit a number of snags because of opposition from some eu member states .
despite syria accepting an additional clause in 2004 about weapons of mass destruction after pressure from states such as britain , the accord was never signed and remained on ice until 2008 . the lowpoint of bilateral relations came in 2005 when the eu froze relations with damascus in 2005 after the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri .
syria was widely blamed for orchestrating the killing , although it denies any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria was believed to be behind the assassination of rafik hariri .
this year , eu states agreed to move toward a deal after appending a 1,000 page memorandum of understanding to the agreement at dutch behest .
it would allow the eu to suspend relations with syria in the event of human rights violations . " the syrians are annoyed because the eu has politicized negotiations and imposed the most stringent conditions with regards to weapons of mass destruction and human rights of all upon them .
they want to make clear that they are not prepared to eat humble pie , ” said asseburg .
at present , europe has association agreements with all other countries in the region , apart from libya .
there have been numerous human rights abuses in many of them and yet no serious move has been made to terminate these accords , leaving the eu open to charges of double standards . temporary setback ?
whether assad 's decision not to sign the deal is just a temporary blip , or a more serious setback is not yet clear , according to clara o-donnell , a research fellow at the centre for european reform -lrb- cef -rrb- .
“ it could be a short-term issue .
it could be quite legitimate .
they might just want to time to go through this very long document .
or syria could want to stall as part of a long-term trend , ” she told deutsche welle .
second-guessing what is going on inside this secretive , authoritarian regime is extremely difficult , according to thomas richter , research fellow at the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
“ you ca n't look in .
it 's like a big black box .
even for people like us who are concerned with the country on a daily basis . ”
richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .
but he does not expect short-term results .
too little , too late ?

however , a partnership deal remains on hold after damascus delayed signing the accord .
deutsche welle asked experts about the implications . as part of the syria 's continuing international rehabilitation , eu diplomats were poised recently to put their pen to an association agreement with the previously isolated regime .
the accord would have brought the country into the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- .
member states had agreed it was time to engage in dialog with a country that is recognized as a key player in the middle east because of its role in lebanon and iraq , its relationship with iran and , as the base of hamas , its influence on palestinian politics .
under the association agreement , syria would have gained financial and trade incentives in exchange for commitments to political and economic reforms .
president bashar al-assad 's insistence that damascus must first review the document has clearly taken brussels aback .
syria shows its displeasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has association agreements with many countries in the region middle east expert muriel asseburg is less surprised .
“ this is a tit-for-tat reaction .
the european has reopened negotiations and dragged its feet with regards to the agreement on three occasions in the past , ” asseburg , who is head of the middle east africa division at the stiftung wissenschaft und politik -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin , told deutsche welle .
damascus and the eu drew up their first draft partnership pact back in 2004 .
however , it subsequently hit a number of snags because of opposition from some eu member states .
despite syria accepting an additional clause in 2004 about weapons of mass destruction after pressure from states such as britain , the accord was never signed and remained on ice until 2008 . the lowpoint of bilateral relations came in 2005 when the eu froze relations with damascus in 2005 after the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri .
syria was widely blamed for orchestrating the killing , although it denies any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria was believed to be behind the assassination of rafik hariri .
this year , eu states agreed to move toward a deal after appending a 1,000 page memorandum of understanding to the agreement at dutch behest .
it would allow the eu to suspend relations with syria in the event of human rights violations . " the syrians are annoyed because the eu has politicized negotiations and imposed the most stringent conditions with regards to weapons of mass destruction and human rights of all upon them .
they want to make clear that they are not prepared to eat humble pie , ” said asseburg .
at present , europe has association agreements with all other countries in the region , apart from libya .
there have been numerous human rights abuses in many of them and yet no serious move has been made to terminate these accords , leaving the eu open to charges of double standards . temporary setback ?
whether assad 's decision not to sign the deal is just a temporary blip , or a more serious setback is not yet clear , according to clara o-donnell , a research fellow at the centre for european reform -lrb- cef -rrb- .
“ it could be a short-term issue .
it could be quite legitimate .
they might just want to time to go through this very long document .
or syria could want to stall as part of a long-term trend , ” she told deutsche welle .
second-guessing what is going on inside this secretive , authoritarian regime is extremely difficult , according to thomas richter , research fellow at the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
“ you ca n't look in .
it 's like a big black box .
even for people like us who are concerned with the country on a daily basis . ”
richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .
but he does not expect short-term results .
too little , too late ?
while the european union may now have reached a common position on how it would like to proceed towards syria , damascus has not been standing still in the meantime .
“ you could say the eu has missed the boat in some respects , " said swp expert asseburg .
“ over the last few years , syria has diversified its foreign relations - not only deepening them with iran , but also developing closer links with turkey and some asian states , such as malaysia . ”
this means that the eu now has less scope to shape relations with syria and influence developments there , according to asseburg .
“ the eu was too slow because there was no consensus among the member states about how to treat syria , ” she said .
the country 's status as a transit land for islamist militants and foreign fighters entering iraq and lebanon makes it an important partner for the west .
while germany and italy have been pressing for a policy of dialog for some time , there was more reluctance , at times , from britain , the netherlands and france .
us pips europe to the post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is also reframing us policy toward the muslim world the shift in policy under the obama administration also means that syria is less interested in europe than they were a few years ago .
although us sanctions are still in force against syria , the new us president has indicated his intention to return an ambassador to the country .
as a negotiator in the middle east peace process , the united states clearly carry more weight than the eu . against this background , richter sees assad 's veto of the association agreement as a possible negotiating strategy to win more concessions from the eu .
resistance to the accord could also come from elements within the bureaucracy who see its economic reforms as a threat to their commercial monopolies . while the giga expert believes it is " regrettable " that the eu might have missed certain chances because of the protracted negotiations with syria , he attributes it , in part , to the unwieldy nature of the bloc .
“ it is incredibly difficult to coordinate foreign policy .
other states are more efficient in that respect , ” he added .
but has the eu really exhausted all its possibilities ?
clara o 'donnell thinks not . the european union is syria 's biggest trading partner and could possibly play a stronger role if it made more use of its economic leverage , the cef researcher believes .
“ if it were to beef up its incentives it would have more traction , ” she said .
the offer of improved visa facilitation and more access to eu 's agriculture market might be two policies that could give the eu more bargaining power in the region as a whole , according to o 'donnell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.12.2009 goal-fest in dortmund , close matches elsewhere in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mats hummels capped off dortmund 's rout of nuremburg with the exception of dortmund , teams in the bundesliga have been fairly evenly matched in the first half of the weekend . at the top of the bundesliga table , undefeated bayer leverkusen were able to hold on to first place for another week after a scoreless draw against hannover 96 .
but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .
dortmund romps nuremburg the first goal of the match in dortmund from kevin grosskreutz in the eighth minute would have been enough to keep visiting nuremburg at bay .
but dortmund steadily added to its lead with strikes from lucas barrios -lrb- 13th minute -rrb- , mohamed zidan -lrb- 36th -rrb- , and mats hummels -lrb- 61st -rrb- for a final score of 4-0 .
the loss pushes nuremburg further into the basement in the bundesliga , where they now occupy the second-to-last position .
coming into the weekend , that spot belonged to vfb stuttgart , who were denied their first win in eight matches in the closing minutes of their home game against bochum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel could have used a win to restore confidence in stuttgart stuttgart defender serdar tasci put the home side in front in the 63rd minute , and it looked like the one goal would be enough to secure the three points for markus babbel 's struggling side .
but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .
" we had been playing with a lot of concentration particularly in the second half so it was particularly disappointing to concede the goal . "
three points for frankfurt , draws for hamburg and wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabian johnson saved the draw for wolfsburg rounding out the rest of saturday 's matches , hosts eintracht frankfurt beat mainz 2-0 .
defender maik franz put frankfurt ahead in the first half , and midfielder alexander meier added another for good measure just as time expired in the 90th minute .
hamburg and hoffenheim played to a 0-0 draw in hamburg .
freiburg blew a chance at an upset over defending bundesliga champions wolfsburg thanks to an own goal via a header from felix bastians in the 27th minute .
freiburg had taken the lead in the 19th minute on a strike from mohamadou idrissou .
a penalty in the 51st minute from midfielder ivica banovic gave visiting freiburg the lead again , but wolfsburg set the final score of 2-2 in the 81st minute after a lofting shot from midfielder fabian johnson. mz / dpa / afp editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.12.2009 goal-fest in dortmund , close matches elsewhere in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mats hummels capped off dortmund 's rout of nuremburg with the exception of dortmund , teams in the bundesliga have been fairly evenly matched in the first half of the weekend . at the top of the bundesliga table , undefeated bayer leverkusen were able to hold on to first place for another week after a scoreless draw against hannover 96 .
but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .
dortmund romps nuremburg the first goal of the match in dortmund from kevin grosskreutz in the eighth minute would have been enough to keep visiting nuremburg at bay .
but dortmund steadily added to its lead with strikes from lucas barrios -lrb- 13th minute -rrb- , mohamed zidan -lrb- 36th -rrb- , and mats hummels -lrb- 61st -rrb- for a final score of 4-0 .
the loss pushes nuremburg further into the basement in the bundesliga , where they now occupy the second-to-last position .
coming into the weekend , that spot belonged to vfb stuttgart , who were denied their first win in eight matches in the closing minutes of their home game against bochum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel could have used a win to restore confidence in stuttgart stuttgart defender serdar tasci put the home side in front in the 63rd minute , and it looked like the one goal would be enough to secure the three points for markus babbel 's struggling side .
but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .
" we had been playing with a lot of concentration particularly in the second half so it was particularly disappointing to concede the goal . "
three points for frankfurt , draws for hamburg and wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabian johnson saved the draw for wolfsburg rounding out the rest of saturday 's matches , hosts eintracht frankfurt beat mainz 2-0 .
defender maik franz put frankfurt ahead in the first half , and midfielder alexander meier added another for good measure just as time expired in the 90th minute .
hamburg and hoffenheim played to a 0-0 draw in hamburg .
freiburg blew a chance at an upset over defending bundesliga champions wolfsburg thanks to an own goal via a header from felix bastians in the 27th minute .
freiburg had taken the lead in the 19th minute on a strike from mohamadou idrissou .
a penalty in the 51st minute from midfielder ivica banovic gave visiting freiburg the lead again , but wolfsburg set the final score of 2-2 in the 81st minute after a lofting shot from midfielder fabian johnson. mz / dpa / afp editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.12.2009 goal-fest in dortmund , close matches elsewhere in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mats hummels capped off dortmund 's rout of nuremburg with the exception of dortmund , teams in the bundesliga have been fairly evenly matched in the first half of the weekend . at the top of the bundesliga table , undefeated bayer leverkusen were able to hold on to first place for another week after a scoreless draw against hannover 96 .
but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .
dortmund romps nuremburg the first goal of the match in dortmund from kevin grosskreutz in the eighth minute would have been enough to keep visiting nuremburg at bay .
but dortmund steadily added to its lead with strikes from lucas barrios -lrb- 13th minute -rrb- , mohamed zidan -lrb- 36th -rrb- , and mats hummels -lrb- 61st -rrb- for a final score of 4-0 .
the loss pushes nuremburg further into the basement in the bundesliga , where they now occupy the second-to-last position .
coming into the weekend , that spot belonged to vfb stuttgart , who were denied their first win in eight matches in the closing minutes of their home game against bochum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel could have used a win to restore confidence in stuttgart stuttgart defender serdar tasci put the home side in front in the 63rd minute , and it looked like the one goal would be enough to secure the three points for markus babbel 's struggling side .
but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .
" we had been playing with a lot of concentration particularly in the second half so it was particularly disappointing to concede the goal . "
three points for frankfurt , draws for hamburg and wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabian johnson saved the draw for wolfsburg rounding out the rest of saturday 's matches , hosts eintracht frankfurt beat mainz 2-0 .
defender maik franz put frankfurt ahead in the first half , and midfielder alexander meier added another for good measure just as time expired in the 90th minute .
hamburg and hoffenheim played to a 0-0 draw in hamburg .
freiburg blew a chance at an upset over defending bundesliga champions wolfsburg thanks to an own goal via a header from felix bastians in the 27th minute .
freiburg had taken the lead in the 19th minute on a strike from mohamadou idrissou .
a penalty in the 51st minute from midfielder ivica banovic gave visiting freiburg the lead again , but wolfsburg set the final score of 2-2 in the 81st minute after a lofting shot from midfielder fabian johnson. mz / dpa / afp editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move is being widely welcomed . in a late change to his schedule , the white house announced that the president would be attending the latter portion of the talks in copenhagen , rather than the opening ceremonies .
the decision was warmly welcomed by attendees and hosts alike .
the copenhagen climate change conference is expecting to host 103 world leaders and result in meaningful international agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gases .
obama 's initial plan , to attend the talks on december 9 before heading to oslo to receive his nobel peace prize , had been greeted with some consternation from other conference delegates and environmentalists .
the us president now intends to attend the final day of the conference on december 18 .
most of the hard bargaining and consensus-making is expected to occur at the end of the conference when many other world leaders are expected to attend .

the move is being widely welcomed . in a late change to his schedule , the white house announced that the president would be attending the latter portion of the talks in copenhagen , rather than the opening ceremonies .
the decision was warmly welcomed by attendees and hosts alike .
the copenhagen climate change conference is expecting to host 103 world leaders and result in meaningful international agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gases .
obama 's initial plan , to attend the talks on december 9 before heading to oslo to receive his nobel peace prize , had been greeted with some consternation from other conference delegates and environmentalists .
the us president now intends to attend the final day of the conference on december 18 .
most of the hard bargaining and consensus-making is expected to occur at the end of the conference when many other world leaders are expected to attend .
a symbolic schedule change the us government said the president 's change of plan was " based on his conversations with other leaders and the progress that has already been made to give momentum to negotiations . "
the news was welcomed by french president nicholas sarkozy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen was pleased by the news sarkozy " is delighted at this decision which shows the importance attached by the united states to the success of this conference on the climate , " a statement from his office said .
denmark 's prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , whose country is hosting the conference , attributed the change to " the growing political momentum to reach an ambitious climate deal in copenhagen . "
" president obama 's strong focus on climate change and his global leadership are key for the copenhagen talks , " rasmussen said .
germany 's environment minister , too , found the news symbolic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.12.2009 goal-fest in dortmund , close matches elsewhere in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mats hummels capped off dortmund 's rout of nuremburg with the exception of dortmund , teams in the bundesliga have been fairly evenly matched in the first half of the weekend . at the top of the bundesliga table , undefeated bayer leverkusen were able to hold on to first place for another week after a scoreless draw against hannover 96 .
but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .
dortmund romps nuremburg the first goal of the match in dortmund from kevin grosskreutz in the eighth minute would have been enough to keep visiting nuremburg at bay .
but dortmund steadily added to its lead with strikes from lucas barrios -lrb- 13th minute -rrb- , mohamed zidan -lrb- 36th -rrb- , and mats hummels -lrb- 61st -rrb- for a final score of 4-0 .
the loss pushes nuremburg further into the basement in the bundesliga , where they now occupy the second-to-last position .
coming into the weekend , that spot belonged to vfb stuttgart , who were denied their first win in eight matches in the closing minutes of their home game against bochum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel could have used a win to restore confidence in stuttgart stuttgart defender serdar tasci put the home side in front in the 63rd minute , and it looked like the one goal would be enough to secure the three points for markus babbel 's struggling side .
but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .
" we had been playing with a lot of concentration particularly in the second half so it was particularly disappointing to concede the goal . "
three points for frankfurt , draws for hamburg and wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabian johnson saved the draw for wolfsburg rounding out the rest of saturday 's matches , hosts eintracht frankfurt beat mainz 2-0 .
defender maik franz put frankfurt ahead in the first half , and midfielder alexander meier added another for good measure just as time expired in the 90th minute .
hamburg and hoffenheim played to a 0-0 draw in hamburg .
freiburg blew a chance at an upset over defending bundesliga champions wolfsburg thanks to an own goal via a header from felix bastians in the 27th minute .
freiburg had taken the lead in the 19th minute on a strike from mohamadou idrissou .
a penalty in the 51st minute from midfielder ivica banovic gave visiting freiburg the lead again , but wolfsburg set the final score of 2-2 in the 81st minute after a lofting shot from midfielder fabian johnson. mz / dpa / afp editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .
dortmund romps nuremburg the first goal of the match in dortmund from kevin grosskreutz in the eighth minute would have been enough to keep visiting nuremburg at bay .
but dortmund steadily added to its lead with strikes from lucas barrios -lrb- 13th minute -rrb- , mohamed zidan -lrb- 36th -rrb- , and mats hummels -lrb- 61st -rrb- for a final score of 4-0 .
the loss pushes nuremburg further into the basement in the bundesliga , where they now occupy the second-to-last position .
coming into the weekend , that spot belonged to vfb stuttgart , who were denied their first win in eight matches in the closing minutes of their home game against bochum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel could have used a win to restore confidence in stuttgart stuttgart defender serdar tasci put the home side in front in the 63rd minute , and it looked like the one goal would be enough to secure the three points for markus babbel 's struggling side .
but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .
" we had been playing with a lot of concentration particularly in the second half so it was particularly disappointing to concede the goal . "

but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .
dortmund romps nuremburg the first goal of the match in dortmund from kevin grosskreutz in the eighth minute would have been enough to keep visiting nuremburg at bay .

the loss pushes nuremburg further into the basement in the bundesliga , where they now occupy the second-to-last position .
coming into the weekend , that spot belonged to vfb stuttgart , who were denied their first win in eight matches in the closing minutes of their home game against bochum .

but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .

the move is being widely welcomed . in a late change to his schedule , the white house announced that the president would be attending the latter portion of the talks in copenhagen , rather than the opening ceremonies .

the copenhagen climate change conference is expecting to host 103 world leaders and result in meaningful international agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gases .

the move is being widely welcomed . in a late change to his schedule , the white house announced that the president would be attending the latter portion of the talks in copenhagen , rather than the opening ceremonies .
the decision was warmly welcomed by attendees and hosts alike .
the copenhagen climate change conference is expecting to host 103 world leaders and result in meaningful international agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gases .

most of the hard bargaining and consensus-making is expected to occur at the end of the conference when many other world leaders are expected to attend .
a symbolic schedule change the us government said the president 's change of plan was " based on his conversations with other leaders and the progress that has already been made to give momentum to negotiations . "
the news was welcomed by french president nicholas sarkozy .

the move is being widely welcomed . in a late change to his schedule , the white house announced that the president would be attending the latter portion of the talks in copenhagen , rather than the opening ceremonies .
the decision was warmly welcomed by attendees and hosts alike .
the copenhagen climate change conference is expecting to host 103 world leaders and result in meaningful international agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gases .
obama 's initial plan , to attend the talks on december 9 before heading to oslo to receive his nobel peace prize , had been greeted with some consternation from other conference delegates and environmentalists .
the us president now intends to attend the final day of the conference on december 18 .
most of the hard bargaining and consensus-making is expected to occur at the end of the conference when many other world leaders are expected to attend .
a symbolic schedule change the us government said the president 's change of plan was " based on his conversations with other leaders and the progress that has already been made to give momentum to negotiations . "
the news was welcomed by french president nicholas sarkozy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen was pleased by the news sarkozy " is delighted at this decision which shows the importance attached by the united states to the success of this conference on the climate , " a statement from his office said .
denmark 's prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , whose country is hosting the conference , attributed the change to " the growing political momentum to reach an ambitious climate deal in copenhagen . "
" president obama 's strong focus on climate change and his global leadership are key for the copenhagen talks , " rasmussen said .
germany 's environment minister , too , found the news symbolic .
" this is a clear signal , " nortbert röttgen told the german newspaper bild .

the move is being widely welcomed . in a late change to his schedule , the white house announced that the president would be attending the latter portion of the talks in copenhagen , rather than the opening ceremonies .
the decision was warmly welcomed by attendees and hosts alike .
the copenhagen climate change conference is expecting to host 103 world leaders and result in meaningful international agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gases .
obama 's initial plan , to attend the talks on december 9 before heading to oslo to receive his nobel peace prize , had been greeted with some consternation from other conference delegates and environmentalists .
the us president now intends to attend the final day of the conference on december 18 .
most of the hard bargaining and consensus-making is expected to occur at the end of the conference when many other world leaders are expected to attend .
a symbolic schedule change the us government said the president 's change of plan was " based on his conversations with other leaders and the progress that has already been made to give momentum to negotiations . "
the news was welcomed by french president nicholas sarkozy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen was pleased by the news sarkozy " is delighted at this decision which shows the importance attached by the united states to the success of this conference on the climate , " a statement from his office said .
denmark 's prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , whose country is hosting the conference , attributed the change to " the growing political momentum to reach an ambitious climate deal in copenhagen . "
" president obama 's strong focus on climate change and his global leadership are key for the copenhagen talks , " rasmussen said .
germany 's environment minister , too , found the news symbolic .
" this is a clear signal , " nortbert röttgen told the german newspaper bild .

the national demonstration was organized by grassroots organizations from around italy which ran appeals on internet and social networking sites calling for the rally .
the crowd , estimated by police to be around 90,000 , included actors and writers , including nobel laureate dario fo .
berlusconi has faced several charges recently of bribery , tax fraud and false accounting .
he has also been accused of attempting to reform italy 's judicial system in a way that would be beneficial to himself .
berlusconi denies all the accusations against him .
while many italian politicians chose to stay out of the fray , some decided to get involved .
" this a day of democracy , a day that shows that the country can come together to build an alternative and most of all to tell berlusconi to go , " said antonio di pietro , an ex anti-graft magistrate who heads the opposition italy of values party .
the demonstration was called " no b day " -lrb- no berlusconi day -rrb- , and participants were encouraged to wear violet , as that color is not represented in any of italy 's political parties .

the move is being widely welcomed . in a late change to his schedule , the white house announced that the president would be attending the latter portion of the talks in copenhagen , rather than the opening ceremonies .
the decision was warmly welcomed by attendees and hosts alike .
the copenhagen climate change conference is expecting to host 103 world leaders and result in meaningful international agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gases .
obama 's initial plan , to attend the talks on december 9 before heading to oslo to receive his nobel peace prize , had been greeted with some consternation from other conference delegates and environmentalists .
the us president now intends to attend the final day of the conference on december 18 .
most of the hard bargaining and consensus-making is expected to occur at the end of the conference when many other world leaders are expected to attend .
a symbolic schedule change the us government said the president 's change of plan was " based on his conversations with other leaders and the progress that has already been made to give momentum to negotiations . "
the news was welcomed by french president nicholas sarkozy .

the move is being widely welcomed . in a late change to his schedule , the white house announced that the president would be attending the latter portion of the talks in copenhagen , rather than the opening ceremonies .
the decision was warmly welcomed by attendees and hosts alike .
the copenhagen climate change conference is expecting to host 103 world leaders and result in meaningful international agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gases .
obama 's initial plan , to attend the talks on december 9 before heading to oslo to receive his nobel peace prize , had been greeted with some consternation from other conference delegates and environmentalists .
the us president now intends to attend the final day of the conference on december 18 .
most of the hard bargaining and consensus-making is expected to occur at the end of the conference when many other world leaders are expected to attend .
a symbolic schedule change the us government said the president 's change of plan was " based on his conversations with other leaders and the progress that has already been made to give momentum to negotiations . "
the news was welcomed by french president nicholas sarkozy .

but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .
dortmund romps nuremburg the first goal of the match in dortmund from kevin grosskreutz in the eighth minute would have been enough to keep visiting nuremburg at bay .
but dortmund steadily added to its lead with strikes from lucas barrios -lrb- 13th minute -rrb- , mohamed zidan -lrb- 36th -rrb- , and mats hummels -lrb- 61st -rrb- for a final score of 4-0 .
the loss pushes nuremburg further into the basement in the bundesliga , where they now occupy the second-to-last position .
coming into the weekend , that spot belonged to vfb stuttgart , who were denied their first win in eight matches in the closing minutes of their home game against bochum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel could have used a win to restore confidence in stuttgart stuttgart defender serdar tasci put the home side in front in the 63rd minute , and it looked like the one goal would be enough to secure the three points for markus babbel 's struggling side .
but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .
" we had been playing with a lot of concentration particularly in the second half so it was particularly disappointing to concede the goal . "

hamburg and hoffenheim played to a 0-0 draw in hamburg .
freiburg blew a chance at an upset over defending bundesliga champions wolfsburg thanks to an own goal via a header from felix bastians in the 27th minute .
freiburg had taken the lead in the 19th minute on a strike from mohamadou idrissou .
a penalty in the 51st minute from midfielder ivica banovic gave visiting freiburg the lead again , but wolfsburg set the final score of 2-2 in the 81st minute after a lofting shot from midfielder fabian johnson. mz / dpa / afp editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .

but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .

reilly will be responsible for drawing up a restructuring program to save the troubled carmaker opel / vauxhall . nick reilly , the newly-appointed head of gm europe , met with workers at opel 's european headquarters in ruesselsheim , germany on friday to talk about the company 's future .
reilly and workers ' council leader klaus franz have been at loggerheads in recent weeks over plans to save turn opel 's fortunes around by cutting an estimated 9,000 jobs .
but on friday the two seemed to have found some common ground .
the " best news of the day " , according to franz , was that reilly had agreed not to make 548 workers at opel 's research and development centre in ruesselsheim redundant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's eisenach plant will not be affected in major overhaul of the company the works council had warned that the development centre could not continue function if it lost so many key engineers and technicians .
reilly , who has been operating as interim ceo before being confirmed in the position , was quoted in a statement as saying he was aware that " the topic of job reductions weighs heavily for every employee , " and that it was " our goal to resolve this subject quickly and reach an agreement with worker representatives . "
franz , meanwhile , welcomed reilly 's " readiness for a constructive dialogue " .
he said that , the workers were now prepared to make some of the concessions requested by the company management , including wage cuts .

but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .
dortmund romps nuremburg the first goal of the match in dortmund from kevin grosskreutz in the eighth minute would have been enough to keep visiting nuremburg at bay .
but dortmund steadily added to its lead with strikes from lucas barrios -lrb- 13th minute -rrb- , mohamed zidan -lrb- 36th -rrb- , and mats hummels -lrb- 61st -rrb- for a final score of 4-0 .
the loss pushes nuremburg further into the basement in the bundesliga , where they now occupy the second-to-last position .
coming into the weekend , that spot belonged to vfb stuttgart , who were denied their first win in eight matches in the closing minutes of their home game against bochum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel could have used a win to restore confidence in stuttgart stuttgart defender serdar tasci put the home side in front in the 63rd minute , and it looked like the one goal would be enough to secure the three points for markus babbel 's struggling side .
but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .
" we had been playing with a lot of concentration particularly in the second half so it was particularly disappointing to concede the goal . "
three points for frankfurt , draws for hamburg and wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabian johnson saved the draw for wolfsburg rounding out the rest of saturday 's matches , hosts eintracht frankfurt beat mainz 2-0 .
defender maik franz put frankfurt ahead in the first half , and midfielder alexander meier added another for good measure just as time expired in the 90th minute .
hamburg and hoffenheim played to a 0-0 draw in hamburg .
freiburg blew a chance at an upset over defending bundesliga champions wolfsburg thanks to an own goal via a header from felix bastians in the 27th minute .
freiburg had taken the lead in the 19th minute on a strike from mohamadou idrissou .
a penalty in the 51st minute from midfielder ivica banovic gave visiting freiburg the lead again , but wolfsburg set the final score of 2-2 in the 81st minute after a lofting shot from midfielder fabian johnson. mz / dpa / afp editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move is being widely welcomed . in a late change to his schedule , the white house announced that the president would be attending the latter portion of the talks in copenhagen , rather than the opening ceremonies .
the decision was warmly welcomed by attendees and hosts alike .
the copenhagen climate change conference is expecting to host 103 world leaders and result in meaningful international agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gases .
obama 's initial plan , to attend the talks on december 9 before heading to oslo to receive his nobel peace prize , had been greeted with some consternation from other conference delegates and environmentalists .
the us president now intends to attend the final day of the conference on december 18 .
most of the hard bargaining and consensus-making is expected to occur at the end of the conference when many other world leaders are expected to attend .
a symbolic schedule change the us government said the president 's change of plan was " based on his conversations with other leaders and the progress that has already been made to give momentum to negotiations . "
the news was welcomed by french president nicholas sarkozy .

thousands of police are being deployed . one year after the shooting of a teenager in athens by police , an act that sent the country into a violent spiral of riots , shootings and bombings , large-scale demonstrations are expected in the greek capital .
police were already attacked by youths in athens and the southern city of corinth on friday .
two officers were injured and president karolos papoulias pleaded for calm .
more than 6,000 police will be deployed on the streets of athens in anticipation of a return to the rioting that continued for two weeks following the shooting-death of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos in 2008 .
" we want to send a clear message , we wo n't tolerate a repeat of the violence and terror scene in central athens , we wo n't hand athens to vandals , " citizen protection minister mihalis chrysohoidis told reporters on friday .
recently elected prime minister george papandreou , who ran on a platform of boosting the economy and helping the poor , urged the people to demonstrate peacefully .
" in a crucial moment for our country , all of us , citizens , political leaders , parties , students representatives , we must protect athens , " he said on thursday .

but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "

but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .

the demonstration was called " no b day " -lrb- no berlusconi day -rrb- , and participants were encouraged to wear violet , as that color is not represented in any of italy 's political parties .

but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .
dortmund romps nuremburg the first goal of the match in dortmund from kevin grosskreutz in the eighth minute would have been enough to keep visiting nuremburg at bay .
but dortmund steadily added to its lead with strikes from lucas barrios -lrb- 13th minute -rrb- , mohamed zidan -lrb- 36th -rrb- , and mats hummels -lrb- 61st -rrb- for a final score of 4-0 .
the loss pushes nuremburg further into the basement in the bundesliga , where they now occupy the second-to-last position .
coming into the weekend , that spot belonged to vfb stuttgart , who were denied their first win in eight matches in the closing minutes of their home game against bochum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel could have used a win to restore confidence in stuttgart stuttgart defender serdar tasci put the home side in front in the 63rd minute , and it looked like the one goal would be enough to secure the three points for markus babbel 's struggling side .
but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .

but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .
dortmund romps nuremburg the first goal of the match in dortmund from kevin grosskreutz in the eighth minute would have been enough to keep visiting nuremburg at bay .
but dortmund steadily added to its lead with strikes from lucas barrios -lrb- 13th minute -rrb- , mohamed zidan -lrb- 36th -rrb- , and mats hummels -lrb- 61st -rrb- for a final score of 4-0 .
the loss pushes nuremburg further into the basement in the bundesliga , where they now occupy the second-to-last position .
coming into the weekend , that spot belonged to vfb stuttgart , who were denied their first win in eight matches in the closing minutes of their home game against bochum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus babbel could have used a win to restore confidence in stuttgart stuttgart defender serdar tasci put the home side in front in the 63rd minute , and it looked like the one goal would be enough to secure the three points for markus babbel 's struggling side .
but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .
" we had been playing with a lot of concentration particularly in the second half so it was particularly disappointing to concede the goal . "

but that makes five draws in the last seven matches for leverkusen , meaning the gap between them and the rest of the bundesliga is steadily shrinking .
leverkusen 's coach jupp heynckes said his side did n't play to its potential .
" we were missing something today , " said heynckes .
" we lacked precision in our passing and we were not so certain in midfield . "
the draw gives second place werder bremen the chance to cut leverkusen 's lead to a single point with a win against cologne on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top of the table is within sight for bayern munich pressure is also mounting on leverkusen from bayern munich , who gained ground with a 2-1 win against borussia moenchengladbach on friday night .
bayern striker mario gomez started the scoring in that match with a low line-drive in the 19th minute , but moenchengladbach 's roel brouwers added the equalizer in the 28th .
the two teams stayed at 1-1 until late in the game , when a free kick from bayern defender holger badstuber put the home team on top .
the loss ended a five-game undefeated streak for moenchengladbach .
dortmund romps nuremburg the first goal of the match in dortmund from kevin grosskreutz in the eighth minute would have been enough to keep visiting nuremburg at bay .

but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .
we were leading 1-0 and i did n't feel bochum looked like being a danger , " said coach babbel .
" we had been playing with a lot of concentration particularly in the second half so it was particularly disappointing to concede the goal . "

berlusconi denies all the accusations against him .
while many italian politicians chose to stay out of the fray , some decided to get involved .

the demonstration was called " no b day " -lrb- no berlusconi day -rrb- , and participants were encouraged to wear violet , as that color is not represented in any of italy 's political parties .

now , the artworks will be housed in a new design by david chipperfield . three years ago , essen 's renowned museum folkwang was bursting at the seams , so the alfried krupp von bohlen and halbach foundation offered funding for a new museum .
a competition began , and the uk 's david chipperfield won the bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cezanne exhibition drew huge crowds to museum folkwang while the museum 's collection wo n't be moved into the building until january , chipperfield has already unveiled his design for the museum 's new building . it will be a space of simple grace - no formal twists and turns , no " wow " -effects , which the architect dislikes anyway . up , up , and away instead , the design is pure lightness of being , full of flowing transitions between three simple box-like structures .
the structures ' shimmering , bright green color gives the design a friendly feel and the large glass surfaces of the facade allow in copious amount of light . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kreidefelsen auf ruegen " by caspar david friedrich , 1818 green courtyards link the three structures to one another , as well as to the museum folkwang building dating from the 1950s . there is another museum building built in the 1980s , but it was never well liked by the public . " there was such a dislike of the 80s building , the 50s building had generated a certain amount of affection , " david chipperfield said . so the 80s-era museum was done away with while the building from the 50s was integrated into his design . " it 's very direct , it 's absolutely simple , it 's quite transparent , " he went on .
" you can see from the outside inside and from inside you see outside , so it seemed to us that there was a certain dna in the building that could be borrowed . " bildunterschrift : chipperfield also redesigned berlin 's " new museum " views all around the glass facades allow for views on all sides - a charming villa in one direction , an ugly apartment building from the 60s in another . despite the structure 's simplicity , it still has something labyrinthine about it .
whether or not visitors will be able to find their way around easily will reveal itself in january , when the museum 's permanent collection moves in . that collection includes graphic art , photography , paintings and sculptures by vincent van gogh , paul cezanne , paul gauguin , henri matisse , and a host of other world-famous artists . author : beatrix novy -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move is being widely welcomed . in a late change to his schedule , the white house announced that the president would be attending the latter portion of the talks in copenhagen , rather than the opening ceremonies .
the decision was warmly welcomed by attendees and hosts alike .
the copenhagen climate change conference is expecting to host 103 world leaders and result in meaningful international agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gases .
obama 's initial plan , to attend the talks on december 9 before heading to oslo to receive his nobel peace prize , had been greeted with some consternation from other conference delegates and environmentalists .
the us president now intends to attend the final day of the conference on december 18 .
most of the hard bargaining and consensus-making is expected to occur at the end of the conference when many other world leaders are expected to attend .
a symbolic schedule change the us government said the president 's change of plan was " based on his conversations with other leaders and the progress that has already been made to give momentum to negotiations . "
the news was welcomed by french president nicholas sarkozy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen was pleased by the news sarkozy " is delighted at this decision which shows the importance attached by the united states to the success of this conference on the climate , " a statement from his office said .
denmark 's prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , whose country is hosting the conference , attributed the change to " the growing political momentum to reach an ambitious climate deal in copenhagen . "
" president obama 's strong focus on climate change and his global leadership are key for the copenhagen talks , " rasmussen said .
germany 's environment minister , too , found the news symbolic .
" this is a clear signal , " nortbert röttgen told the german newspaper bild .
" obama wants the conference to succeed , and he is putting all the weight of his personality into the equation , " he said. sjt / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but bochum , down to ten men after diego klimowicz was sent off with a red card in the 81st minute , managed a last gasp free-kick from defender christian fuchs in the 89th minute that got the best of stuttgart keeper jens lehmann .
the final score was a 1-1 draw , but it stung almost as much as a loss for stuttgart .
" the result is a great disappointment .

" there was such a dislike of the 80s building , the 50s building had generated a certain amount of affection , " david chipperfield said . so the 80s-era museum was done away with while the building from the 50s was integrated into his design . " it 's very direct , it 's absolutely simple , it 's quite transparent , " he went on .
" you can see from the outside inside and from inside you see outside , so it seemed to us that there was a certain dna in the building that could be borrowed . " bildunterschrift : chipperfield also redesigned berlin 's " new museum " views all around the glass facades allow for views on all sides - a charming villa in one direction , an ugly apartment building from the 60s in another . despite the structure 's simplicity , it still has something labyrinthine about it .
whether or not visitors will be able to find their way around easily will reveal itself in january , when the museum 's permanent collection moves in . that collection includes graphic art , photography , paintings and sculptures by vincent van gogh , paul cezanne , paul gauguin , henri matisse , and a host of other world-famous artists . author : beatrix novy -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , a partnership deal remains on hold after damascus delayed signing the accord .
deutsche welle asked experts about the implications . as part of the syria 's continuing international rehabilitation , eu diplomats were poised recently to put their pen to an association agreement with the previously isolated regime .
the accord would have brought the country into the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- .
member states had agreed it was time to engage in dialog with a country that is recognized as a key player in the middle east because of its role in lebanon and iraq , its relationship with iran and , as the base of hamas , its influence on palestinian politics .
under the association agreement , syria would have gained financial and trade incentives in exchange for commitments to political and economic reforms .
president bashar al-assad 's insistence that damascus must first review the document has clearly taken brussels aback .
syria shows its displeasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has association agreements with many countries in the region middle east expert muriel asseburg is less surprised .
“ this is a tit-for-tat reaction .
the european has reopened negotiations and dragged its feet with regards to the agreement on three occasions in the past , ” asseburg , who is head of the middle east africa division at the stiftung wissenschaft und politik -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin , told deutsche welle .
damascus and the eu drew up their first draft partnership pact back in 2004 .
however , it subsequently hit a number of snags because of opposition from some eu member states .
despite syria accepting an additional clause in 2004 about weapons of mass destruction after pressure from states such as britain , the accord was never signed and remained on ice until 2008 . the lowpoint of bilateral relations came in 2005 when the eu froze relations with damascus in 2005 after the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri .
syria was widely blamed for orchestrating the killing , although it denies any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria was believed to be behind the assassination of rafik hariri .
this year , eu states agreed to move toward a deal after appending a 1,000 page memorandum of understanding to the agreement at dutch behest .
it would allow the eu to suspend relations with syria in the event of human rights violations . " the syrians are annoyed because the eu has politicized negotiations and imposed the most stringent conditions with regards to weapons of mass destruction and human rights of all upon them .
they want to make clear that they are not prepared to eat humble pie , ” said asseburg .
at present , europe has association agreements with all other countries in the region , apart from libya .
there have been numerous human rights abuses in many of them and yet no serious move has been made to terminate these accords , leaving the eu open to charges of double standards . temporary setback ?
whether assad 's decision not to sign the deal is just a temporary blip , or a more serious setback is not yet clear , according to clara o-donnell , a research fellow at the centre for european reform -lrb- cef -rrb- .
“ it could be a short-term issue .
it could be quite legitimate .
they might just want to time to go through this very long document .
or syria could want to stall as part of a long-term trend , ” she told deutsche welle .
second-guessing what is going on inside this secretive , authoritarian regime is extremely difficult , according to thomas richter , research fellow at the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
“ you ca n't look in .
it 's like a big black box .
even for people like us who are concerned with the country on a daily basis . ”
richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .
but he does not expect short-term results .
too little , too late ?
while the european union may now have reached a common position on how it would like to proceed towards syria , damascus has not been standing still in the meantime .
“ you could say the eu has missed the boat in some respects , " said swp expert asseburg .
“ over the last few years , syria has diversified its foreign relations - not only deepening them with iran , but also developing closer links with turkey and some asian states , such as malaysia . ”
this means that the eu now has less scope to shape relations with syria and influence developments there , according to asseburg .
“ the eu was too slow because there was no consensus among the member states about how to treat syria , ” she said .
the country 's status as a transit land for islamist militants and foreign fighters entering iraq and lebanon makes it an important partner for the west .
while germany and italy have been pressing for a policy of dialog for some time , there was more reluctance , at times , from britain , the netherlands and france .
us pips europe to the post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is also reframing us policy toward the muslim world the shift in policy under the obama administration also means that syria is less interested in europe than they were a few years ago .
although us sanctions are still in force against syria , the new us president has indicated his intention to return an ambassador to the country .
as a negotiator in the middle east peace process , the united states clearly carry more weight than the eu . against this background , richter sees assad 's veto of the association agreement as a possible negotiating strategy to win more concessions from the eu .
resistance to the accord could also come from elements within the bureaucracy who see its economic reforms as a threat to their commercial monopolies . while the giga expert believes it is " regrettable " that the eu might have missed certain chances because of the protracted negotiations with syria , he attributes it , in part , to the unwieldy nature of the bloc .
“ it is incredibly difficult to coordinate foreign policy .
other states are more efficient in that respect , ” he added .
but has the eu really exhausted all its possibilities ?
clara o 'donnell thinks not . the european union is syria 's biggest trading partner and could possibly play a stronger role if it made more use of its economic leverage , the cef researcher believes .
“ if it were to beef up its incentives it would have more traction , ” she said .
the offer of improved visa facilitation and more access to eu 's agriculture market might be two policies that could give the eu more bargaining power in the region as a whole , according to o 'donnell .

however , a partnership deal remains on hold after damascus delayed signing the accord .
deutsche welle asked experts about the implications . as part of the syria 's continuing international rehabilitation , eu diplomats were poised recently to put their pen to an association agreement with the previously isolated regime .
the accord would have brought the country into the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- .
member states had agreed it was time to engage in dialog with a country that is recognized as a key player in the middle east because of its role in lebanon and iraq , its relationship with iran and , as the base of hamas , its influence on palestinian politics .
under the association agreement , syria would have gained financial and trade incentives in exchange for commitments to political and economic reforms .
president bashar al-assad 's insistence that damascus must first review the document has clearly taken brussels aback .
syria shows its displeasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has association agreements with many countries in the region middle east expert muriel asseburg is less surprised .
“ this is a tit-for-tat reaction .
the european has reopened negotiations and dragged its feet with regards to the agreement on three occasions in the past , ” asseburg , who is head of the middle east africa division at the stiftung wissenschaft und politik -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin , told deutsche welle .
damascus and the eu drew up their first draft partnership pact back in 2004 .
however , it subsequently hit a number of snags because of opposition from some eu member states .
despite syria accepting an additional clause in 2004 about weapons of mass destruction after pressure from states such as britain , the accord was never signed and remained on ice until 2008 . the lowpoint of bilateral relations came in 2005 when the eu froze relations with damascus in 2005 after the assassination of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri .
syria was widely blamed for orchestrating the killing , although it denies any involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria was believed to be behind the assassination of rafik hariri .
this year , eu states agreed to move toward a deal after appending a 1,000 page memorandum of understanding to the agreement at dutch behest .
it would allow the eu to suspend relations with syria in the event of human rights violations . " the syrians are annoyed because the eu has politicized negotiations and imposed the most stringent conditions with regards to weapons of mass destruction and human rights of all upon them .
they want to make clear that they are not prepared to eat humble pie , ” said asseburg .
at present , europe has association agreements with all other countries in the region , apart from libya .
there have been numerous human rights abuses in many of them and yet no serious move has been made to terminate these accords , leaving the eu open to charges of double standards . temporary setback ?
whether assad 's decision not to sign the deal is just a temporary blip , or a more serious setback is not yet clear , according to clara o-donnell , a research fellow at the centre for european reform -lrb- cef -rrb- .
“ it could be a short-term issue .
it could be quite legitimate .
they might just want to time to go through this very long document .
or syria could want to stall as part of a long-term trend , ” she told deutsche welle .
second-guessing what is going on inside this secretive , authoritarian regime is extremely difficult , according to thomas richter , research fellow at the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
“ you ca n't look in .
it 's like a big black box .
even for people like us who are concerned with the country on a daily basis . ”
richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .
but he does not expect short-term results .
too little , too late ?
while the european union may now have reached a common position on how it would like to proceed towards syria , damascus has not been standing still in the meantime .
“ you could say the eu has missed the boat in some respects , " said swp expert asseburg .
“ over the last few years , syria has diversified its foreign relations - not only deepening them with iran , but also developing closer links with turkey and some asian states , such as malaysia . ”
this means that the eu now has less scope to shape relations with syria and influence developments there , according to asseburg .
“ the eu was too slow because there was no consensus among the member states about how to treat syria , ” she said .
the country 's status as a transit land for islamist militants and foreign fighters entering iraq and lebanon makes it an important partner for the west .
while germany and italy have been pressing for a policy of dialog for some time , there was more reluctance , at times , from britain , the netherlands and france .
us pips europe to the post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is also reframing us policy toward the muslim world the shift in policy under the obama administration also means that syria is less interested in europe than they were a few years ago .
although us sanctions are still in force against syria , the new us president has indicated his intention to return an ambassador to the country .
as a negotiator in the middle east peace process , the united states clearly carry more weight than the eu . against this background , richter sees assad 's veto of the association agreement as a possible negotiating strategy to win more concessions from the eu .
resistance to the accord could also come from elements within the bureaucracy who see its economic reforms as a threat to their commercial monopolies . while the giga expert believes it is " regrettable " that the eu might have missed certain chances because of the protracted negotiations with syria , he attributes it , in part , to the unwieldy nature of the bloc .
“ it is incredibly difficult to coordinate foreign policy .
other states are more efficient in that respect , ” he added .
but has the eu really exhausted all its possibilities ?
clara o 'donnell thinks not . the european union is syria 's biggest trading partner and could possibly play a stronger role if it made more use of its economic leverage , the cef researcher believes .
“ if it were to beef up its incentives it would have more traction , ” she said .
the offer of improved visa facilitation and more access to eu 's agriculture market might be two policies that could give the eu more bargaining power in the region as a whole , according to o 'donnell .

this year , eu states agreed to move toward a deal after appending a 1,000 page memorandum of understanding to the agreement at dutch behest .
it would allow the eu to suspend relations with syria in the event of human rights violations . " the syrians are annoyed because the eu has politicized negotiations and imposed the most stringent conditions with regards to weapons of mass destruction and human rights of all upon them .
they want to make clear that they are not prepared to eat humble pie , ” said asseburg .
at present , europe has association agreements with all other countries in the region , apart from libya .
there have been numerous human rights abuses in many of them and yet no serious move has been made to terminate these accords , leaving the eu open to charges of double standards . temporary setback ?
whether assad 's decision not to sign the deal is just a temporary blip , or a more serious setback is not yet clear , according to clara o-donnell , a research fellow at the centre for european reform -lrb- cef -rrb- .
“ it could be a short-term issue .
it could be quite legitimate .
they might just want to time to go through this very long document .
or syria could want to stall as part of a long-term trend , ” she told deutsche welle .
second-guessing what is going on inside this secretive , authoritarian regime is extremely difficult , according to thomas richter , research fellow at the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
“ you ca n't look in .
it 's like a big black box .
even for people like us who are concerned with the country on a daily basis . ”
richter believes that the next few years will see more progress in improving relations between the eu and syria .
but he does not expect short-term results .
too little , too late ?
while the european union may now have reached a common position on how it would like to proceed towards syria , damascus has not been standing still in the meantime .
“ you could say the eu has missed the boat in some respects , " said swp expert asseburg .
“ over the last few years , syria has diversified its foreign relations - not only deepening them with iran , but also developing closer links with turkey and some asian states , such as malaysia . ”
this means that the eu now has less scope to shape relations with syria and influence developments there , according to asseburg .
“ the eu was too slow because there was no consensus among the member states about how to treat syria , ” she said .
the country 's status as a transit land for islamist militants and foreign fighters entering iraq and lebanon makes it an important partner for the west .
while germany and italy have been pressing for a policy of dialog for some time , there was more reluctance , at times , from britain , the netherlands and france .
us pips europe to the post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is also reframing us policy toward the muslim world the shift in policy under the obama administration also means that syria is less interested in europe than they were a few years ago .
although us sanctions are still in force against syria , the new us president has indicated his intention to return an ambassador to the country .
as a negotiator in the middle east peace process , the united states clearly carry more weight than the eu . against this background , richter sees assad 's veto of the association agreement as a possible negotiating strategy to win more concessions from the eu .
resistance to the accord could also come from elements within the bureaucracy who see its economic reforms as a threat to their commercial monopolies . while the giga expert believes it is " regrettable " that the eu might have missed certain chances because of the protracted negotiations with syria , he attributes it , in part , to the unwieldy nature of the bloc .
“ it is incredibly difficult to coordinate foreign policy .
other states are more efficient in that respect , ” he added .
but has the eu really exhausted all its possibilities ?
clara o 'donnell thinks not . the european union is syria 's biggest trading partner and could possibly play a stronger role if it made more use of its economic leverage , the cef researcher believes .
“ if it were to beef up its incentives it would have more traction , ” she said .
the offer of improved visa facilitation and more access to eu 's agriculture market might be two policies that could give the eu more bargaining power in the region as a whole , according to o 'donnell .

deutsche welle asked experts about the implications . as part of the syria 's continuing international rehabilitation , eu diplomats were poised recently to put their pen to an association agreement with the previously isolated regime .
the accord would have brought the country into the european neighborhood policy -lrb- enp -rrb- .

the move is being widely welcomed . in a late change to his schedule , the white house announced that the president would be attending the latter portion of the talks in copenhagen , rather than the opening ceremonies .
the decision was warmly welcomed by attendees and hosts alike .
the copenhagen climate change conference is expecting to host 103 world leaders and result in meaningful international agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gases .
obama 's initial plan , to attend the talks on december 9 before heading to oslo to receive his nobel peace prize , had been greeted with some consternation from other conference delegates and environmentalists .
the us president now intends to attend the final day of the conference on december 18 .
most of the hard bargaining and consensus-making is expected to occur at the end of the conference when many other world leaders are expected to attend .
a symbolic schedule change the us government said the president 's change of plan was " based on his conversations with other leaders and the progress that has already been made to give momentum to negotiations . "
the news was welcomed by french president nicholas sarkozy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen was pleased by the news sarkozy " is delighted at this decision which shows the importance attached by the united states to the success of this conference on the climate , " a statement from his office said .
denmark 's prime minister lars lokke rasmussen , whose country is hosting the conference , attributed the change to " the growing political momentum to reach an ambitious climate deal in copenhagen . "
" president obama 's strong focus on climate change and his global leadership are key for the copenhagen talks , " rasmussen said .
germany 's environment minister , too , found the news symbolic .
" this is a clear signal , " nortbert röttgen told the german newspaper bild .
" obama wants the conference to succeed , and he is putting all the weight of his personality into the equation , " he said. sjt / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is a symbol of hope and freedom , and with these saplings we can share that hope and freedom with the whole world , ” said amsterdam city councillor marijke vos just before planting the saplings in the amsterdamse bos park .
the sprouts are from among 150 donated by the anne frank house , which the museum says will help preserve frank 's memory .
other saplings are to be planted in the park over the next few years .
they were grown from chestnuts collected in 2005 from the white chestnut tree mentioned in frank 's diary .
the tree was anne frank 's only link to nature .
the jewish teenager was able to see it while she was hidden up in a cramped , concealed attic in amsterdam for more than two years during world war two .
she wrote about the tree three times in the diary that that she kept while she and her family were hiding from the nazis and which became a worldwide best-seller . " our chestnut tree is in full blossom .
it is covered with leaves and is even more beautiful than last year , " she wrote in may 1944 , not long before her family was betrayed to the nazis .
frank died in the bergen-belsen concentration camp in 1945 , aged just 15 .
the chestnut tree itself is infected with fungus and at risk of falling over ; it was set to be felled in 2007 .
officials and conservationists however managed to secure it with a frame , which is expected to save the tree for a few more years .
it will eventually be replaced with one of the saplings taken from it .
there have been similar plantings in cities such as paris and madrid .
vos said there are plans to plant a sapling near to ground zero in new york where nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks on the world trade center in september 11 , 2001. wl / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dozens of others have been hospitalized in serious or critical condition . a spokeswoman for the emergencies ministry in moscow said the fire occured at the lame horse nightclub in the center of perm , an industrial city of 1.2 million located more than 1,000 km east of moscow .
authorities say an indoor fireworks display caused the fire .
an errant firework hit the club 's plastic ceiling at around 1:30 a.m.
friday , local time .
wicker decorations on the wall caught fire , and many of the dead were killed in the resulting stampede for the exits .
" people panicked and succumbed to burns , general crush and gas poisoning , " perm 's regional public security minister , igor orlov , told the itar-tass news agency .
a witness told reuters that dozens of charred bodies were piled on the pavement outside the club as medics transferred the injured into ambulances .
blood-covered women in evening dresses laid on gurneys as policemen swarmed the scene .

chechen militants claimed responsibility for that attack .
" we are not talking about a terrorist attack , " oleg chirkunov , the governor of perm region , told vesti-24 tv channel .
treating the victims , investigating the cause local police estimated that more than 230 people were inside the club at the time , celebrating its anniversary .
most were employees of the club along with their friends and relatives . two airplanes equipped to treat burns and staffed with doctors , psychologists and rescue workers were sent to perm from moscow early on saturday , officials said . prime minister vladimir putin sent emergencies minister sergei shoigu , health minister tatyana golikova and interior minister rashid nurgaliyev to the scene to coordinate rescue efforts . the kremlin has ordered the formation of a government commission to deal with the accident , and two of the club 's owners have been arrested and accused of repeatedly ignoring safety warnings .
one of the owners denied these claims , but russian president dmitry medvedev has criticised the owners for neglecting safety standards .
