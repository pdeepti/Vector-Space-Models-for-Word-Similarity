but german politicians are more concerned with the dispute 's political consequences . swiss defense minsiter ueli maurer has replaced the mercedes s430 he used to ride in , with a renault espace .
the symbolic move is meant to show his discontent with the ongoing tax-haven disagreement between switzerland and germany . " the tax dispute has annoyed and angered him so much that he has switched to another pool car , " maurer 's spokesman said sunday , march 22 . the quarrel began last week when german finance minister peer steinbrueck said the swiss were like indians running scared from a cavalry ready to enforce international banking laws .
in return , a swiss politician compared steinbrueck to a nazi . a domestic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a renault is edging out mercedes in switzerland herbert scheidt , the head of zurich-based vontobel banking group , accused steinbrueck of running roughshod over swiss interests . " as a german , i find the virulent and rough behavior shown by the finance minster of the last days and weeks to be particularly regrettable , " scheidt told the welt am sonntag newspaper , adding that the swiss view of tax law was something berlin has to accept for the time being . while swiss politicians decry what they see as foreign interference in their domestic affairs , germans have accused steinbrueck of tarnishing germany 's image abroad . " the completely inappropriate way the finance minster has expressed himself to switzerland in the legitimate fight against tax havens is inacceptable , " volker kauder , the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group leader , told the leipziger volkszeitung on monday . punishing german banks steinbrueck has said he would be willing to meet his swiss counterpart but justified his remarks saying he had learned to " formulate his remarks regarding tax havens in switzerland in an unambiguous way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin may try to put an end to non-transparent banking deals part of the unambiguous action could be punishing german banks with subsidiaries in switzerland , according to a report in the german newsmagazine der spiegel . the office responsible for administrating germany 's financial sector bailout funds -lrb- bafin -rrb- reportedly requested information from banks about their operations in switzerland and liechtenstein , to ensure regulations dealing with the prevention of money laundering were being met . according to the magazine , the banks will be forced to end " non-transparent business relationships . " spiegel said a swiss subsidiary of deutsche bank administered accounts held by foundations in liechtenstein .
foundations in the alpine principality have been used by tax evaders , including former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel , to hide money from authorities . deutsche bank as well as other banks with swiss subsidiaries , including commerzbank and dresdner bank , did not comment on the spiegel report . the organization for economic cooperation and development has named liechtenstein , monaco and andorra as uncooperative tax havens . sms / jen / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier . " we are working for safe and attractive conditions for the transit of russian gas , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" there is no intention to exclude russia . " european confidence in ukraine took a hit in january , when a bitter argument between russia and ukraine over prices left europe without access to most russian gas for more than two weeks .
the two countries eventually came to an agreement , but tensions continue to run high . " we can not allow our citizens to experience fuel shortages in the depths of winter again , " said eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner . a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants better monitoring of gas supplies as part of the agreement announced in brussels on monday , the former soviet country laid out a plan to overhaul its gas transit system .
ukraine has agreed to reforms which will include setting up an independent company to oversee the multi-billion-euro project . ukraine 's 40-year-old natural gas system is in desperate need of an upgrade .
experts have estimated that ukraine needs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- over the next few years just to keep its system functioning properly . the european union has a keen interest in having ukraine 's system running smoothly as some 20 percent of the bloc 's natural gas supplies come from russia via ukraine . ukraine 's prime minister yulia tymoshenko told those attending the meeting in brussels that ukraine wants 5.5 billion euros to modernize the current system and also boost capacity . " today 's conference is extremely important for us because europe 's energy security requires an approach based on solidarity and agreement between the eu and ukraine , " tymoshenko said . both tymoshenko and her bitter political rival president viktor yushchenko attended the meeting in brussels and threw their support behind the bilateral declaration . europe hopeful , but cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has asked for foreign investment to upgrade its system analysts say that the pledge signed on monday could sound the death knell for the monopoly of ukrainian gas company naftogaz , which currently both manages the system and provides ukrainian consumers with gas . before aid and investment money begins flowing , ukraine will have to prove it is willing to make big changes , said philippe maystadt , head of the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- . the bank is willing to co-finance the modernization of ukraine 's gas system , but only if it is done in a " commercially sound and transparent way . " the eu currently has monitors in ukraine to check on the flow of russian gas through a key ukrainian pipeline , and the bloc has said it will increase surveillance if necessary to ensure that gas keeps flowing to europe . europe looking at other options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has hoped monitors can keep supplies flowing eu countries , in an effort to avoid being held hostage by future disputes between russia and ukraine , recently agreed to invest 200 million euros in the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas direct from the caspian sea to europe . germany 's deputy economics minister bernd pfaffenbach pointed out that europe 's demand for energy in the future will continue to grow and that it makes sense to " diversify the supply sources and the delivery networks . " german energy company rwe has thrown its support behind the project , said ceo stefan judisch . " with nabucco , german consumers will have more gas , and gas could also become cheaper because there will be more competition , " judisch said . details about how the project will be financed are on the agenda for an eu meeting in prague in may . th / tt / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu 's new eastern partnership draws ire from russia russian foreign minister sergei lavrov criticized on saturday the european union 's new partnership with six former soviet states , suggesting the 27-member bloc was seeking to extend its own sphere of influence .

the number of turkish citizens living in germany , however , declined by 25,200 to 1.7 million by year-end in 2008 , due mainly to the number of turks who were granted german citizenship during the course of the entire year .
ethnic turks residing in germany must normally choose between turkish or german citizenship .
even though nationality laws based mainly on descent were eased in 2000 , it is not uncommon for those born in germany to foreigners to assume their parents ' nationality instead . influx from the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law made it easier for those born in germany to foreign parents to become citizens in contrast to the decline in numbers of turkish nationals , the number of foreigners from eu member states rose in the same 12-month period .
the largest numbers of eu foreigners came from countries that had joined the 27-nation bloc since its expansion eastwards in 2004 . the number of poles who settled in germany went up by some 9,000 in 2008 compared to the previous year .
however the biggest percentage gains came from rumania and bulgaria , which were admitted to the european union in 2007 .
the number of rumanian nationals went up by 9,700 in 2008 , up 12 percent from the previous year , while the number of bulgarian citizens rose to 7,200 , up 15 percent from 2007 .
eu passports not very common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign " guest workers " helped fuel the german economic boom about 80 percent of all foreigners living in germany are turkish or european nationals , of which only one third has eu passports .
the rest come from countries that hope to join the eu , such as turkey , croatia , macedonia as well as russia and other countries . decades after the first " guest workers " arrived from turkey during the wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1960s , the turks are still germany 's largest foreign minority , followed by the italians , poles , serbs , greeks , croatians and russians .
nearly all of the 192 nations that are member states of the united nations are represented in germany , reflecting a growing diversity in the entire resident population , which numbers 82 million . most foreigners are long-time residents the majority of foreigners in germany are long time residents of the country .
some 72 percent or nearly five million foreigners have lived in germany for a minimum of eight years and therefore even meet the minimum residency requirements to apply for citizenship . about half of those long-time foreign residents have been in the country for more than twenty years , whereas twenty percent of all foreigners were born in germany .
the average age of foreign residents is 38 years old , a slight rise from 2007 , which suggests that since the 2000 nationality laws took effect , more foreigners born in germany are becoming citizens , according to the statistics office .
in 2008 , there were only 356,400 children under the age of 10 who were foreign nationals , compared to 521,300 in the same age group three years ago . df / tt / dpa / afp / destatis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 23.03.2009 changing dialects between the two koreas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korean is the official language of north and south korea north and south korea have differences that go beyond politics and economy .
even their languages are n't quite the same .
since the two nations were split more than sixty years ago , their dialects have gone in different directions .
and for thousands of north koreans refugees , what their south korean brethren speak these days , sounds a bit foreign . chae su jeong says that when she defected from north korea in 2001 , she was surprised to see how modern seoul was .
coming from one of north korea ’ s poorest areas , the 42 year old couldn ’ t believe how many cars there were and couldn ’ t figure out how bank atms worked .
she got over those things after a few months , but she says what really shocked her was when she encountered a language barrier with her south korean co-workers .
chae says she did n't realise how different north and south korean languages were until she started working for a recycling company .
back home in north korea , she says , they have only one word to describe all types of paper , but here there are many .
it really embarrassed her that she did n't know what her co-workers were talking about .
political manipulation the north korean language , like much of the nation itself , is stuck in a time warp .
it has retained a lot of words and expressions that south koreans no longer use .
or the meanings have changed .
some analysts say that political manipulation is another reason for the language divide .
kim seok hyang lectures at the ewha institute for unification studies in seoul and has written a book on the use of language in north korea .
she gives an example of one word whose meaning was changed to honour the north ’ s rulers .
“ sun-mul , in korean language , means present to your friend .
but now , in north korea , sun-mul is the reserved word by kim il sung and kim jong il , so only kim il sung and kim jong il are the only two who can give sun-mul to another person . ”
use of ' konglish ' another linguistic problem for north korean refugees in south korea is caused by the influx of english words .
the mix is known as konglish .
this is becoming more prevalent - especially in the field of modern technology .
it is difficult for someone to know how to send a fax or make a xerox if he or she has never heard the word or seen the devices used .
defector chae su jeong says it was tough to learn all these new words .
chae says she had no idea what the word “ camera ” meant .
in north korea , it 's called a sa-jin-gi .
she adds that since she started learning english , everyday life in south korea has become a little easier .
north korea not only keeps english words out of the language but has also done away with chinese characters , which are still learned in south korea .
for these reasons , north koreans believe they speak a superior form of the korean language .
many continue to think this even after they have defected to south korea .
" north korean defectors are arguing their way of using korean language is pure and clean way of protecting korean from outside dirty thing , " says kim seok hyang .
those dirty things are of course foreign words . jason strother 23/03/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

an oil-rich gulf investor , who also owns a premier english soccer club , plans to take a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler .
the move would make aabar investments the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder . an abu dhabi investor is paying 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 billion -rrb- to scoop up a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler , becoming the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder at a time the world auto industry is undergoing its worst crisis in decades .
the gulf-based aabar investments , which is a partially state-owned affiliate of international petroleum investment company -lrb- ipic -rrb- , is paying 20.27 euros a share for the offering , a slight discount from friday 's closing price of 21.55 euros .
daimler had increased its share capital by ten percent to allow aabar to purchase the new equity stake .

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier . " we are working for safe and attractive conditions for the transit of russian gas , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" there is no intention to exclude russia . " european confidence in ukraine took a hit in january , when a bitter argument between russia and ukraine over prices left europe without access to most russian gas for more than two weeks .
the two countries eventually came to an agreement , but tensions continue to run high . " we can not allow our citizens to experience fuel shortages in the depths of winter again , " said eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner . a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants better monitoring of gas supplies as part of the agreement announced in brussels on monday , the former soviet country laid out a plan to overhaul its gas transit system .
ukraine has agreed to reforms which will include setting up an independent company to oversee the multi-billion-euro project . ukraine 's 40-year-old natural gas system is in desperate need of an upgrade .
experts have estimated that ukraine needs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- over the next few years just to keep its system functioning properly . the european union has a keen interest in having ukraine 's system running smoothly as some 20 percent of the bloc 's natural gas supplies come from russia via ukraine . ukraine 's prime minister yulia tymoshenko told those attending the meeting in brussels that ukraine wants 5.5 billion euros to modernize the current system and also boost capacity . " today 's conference is extremely important for us because europe 's energy security requires an approach based on solidarity and agreement between the eu and ukraine , " tymoshenko said . both tymoshenko and her bitter political rival president viktor yushchenko attended the meeting in brussels and threw their support behind the bilateral declaration . europe hopeful , but cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has asked for foreign investment to upgrade its system analysts say that the pledge signed on monday could sound the death knell for the monopoly of ukrainian gas company naftogaz , which currently both manages the system and provides ukrainian consumers with gas . before aid and investment money begins flowing , ukraine will have to prove it is willing to make big changes , said philippe maystadt , head of the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- . the bank is willing to co-finance the modernization of ukraine 's gas system , but only if it is done in a " commercially sound and transparent way . " the eu currently has monitors in ukraine to check on the flow of russian gas through a key ukrainian pipeline , and the bloc has said it will increase surveillance if necessary to ensure that gas keeps flowing to europe . europe looking at other options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has hoped monitors can keep supplies flowing eu countries , in an effort to avoid being held hostage by future disputes between russia and ukraine , recently agreed to invest 200 million euros in the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas direct from the caspian sea to europe . germany 's deputy economics minister bernd pfaffenbach pointed out that europe 's demand for energy in the future will continue to grow and that it makes sense to " diversify the supply sources and the delivery networks . " german energy company rwe has thrown its support behind the project , said ceo stefan judisch . " with nabucco , german consumers will have more gas , and gas could also become cheaper because there will be more competition , " judisch said . details about how the project will be financed are on the agenda for an eu meeting in prague in may . th / tt / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 23.03.2009 germany urges eu action to halt plunging milk prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dairy farmers say they ca n't make ends meet last summer , german farmers launched a series of " milk strikes " to protest falling prices .
since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier . " we are working for safe and attractive conditions for the transit of russian gas , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" there is no intention to exclude russia . " european confidence in ukraine took a hit in january , when a bitter argument between russia and ukraine over prices left europe without access to most russian gas for more than two weeks .
the two countries eventually came to an agreement , but tensions continue to run high . " we can not allow our citizens to experience fuel shortages in the depths of winter again , " said eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner . a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants better monitoring of gas supplies as part of the agreement announced in brussels on monday , the former soviet country laid out a plan to overhaul its gas transit system .
ukraine has agreed to reforms which will include setting up an independent company to oversee the multi-billion-euro project . ukraine 's 40-year-old natural gas system is in desperate need of an upgrade .
experts have estimated that ukraine needs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- over the next few years just to keep its system functioning properly . the european union has a keen interest in having ukraine 's system running smoothly as some 20 percent of the bloc 's natural gas supplies come from russia via ukraine . ukraine 's prime minister yulia tymoshenko told those attending the meeting in brussels that ukraine wants 5.5 billion euros to modernize the current system and also boost capacity . " today 's conference is extremely important for us because europe 's energy security requires an approach based on solidarity and agreement between the eu and ukraine , " tymoshenko said . both tymoshenko and her bitter political rival president viktor yushchenko attended the meeting in brussels and threw their support behind the bilateral declaration . europe hopeful , but cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has asked for foreign investment to upgrade its system analysts say that the pledge signed on monday could sound the death knell for the monopoly of ukrainian gas company naftogaz , which currently both manages the system and provides ukrainian consumers with gas . before aid and investment money begins flowing , ukraine will have to prove it is willing to make big changes , said philippe maystadt , head of the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- . the bank is willing to co-finance the modernization of ukraine 's gas system , but only if it is done in a " commercially sound and transparent way . " the eu currently has monitors in ukraine to check on the flow of russian gas through a key ukrainian pipeline , and the bloc has said it will increase surveillance if necessary to ensure that gas keeps flowing to europe . europe looking at other options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has hoped monitors can keep supplies flowing eu countries , in an effort to avoid being held hostage by future disputes between russia and ukraine , recently agreed to invest 200 million euros in the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas direct from the caspian sea to europe . germany 's deputy economics minister bernd pfaffenbach pointed out that europe 's demand for energy in the future will continue to grow and that it makes sense to " diversify the supply sources and the delivery networks . " german energy company rwe has thrown its support behind the project , said ceo stefan judisch . " with nabucco , german consumers will have more gas , and gas could also become cheaper because there will be more competition , " judisch said . details about how the project will be financed are on the agenda for an eu meeting in prague in may . th / tt / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we should n't be afraid of such a decision , " he said in an interview published in the bild am sonntag newspaper .

an oil-rich gulf investor , who also owns a premier english soccer club , plans to take a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler .
the move would make aabar investments the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder . an abu dhabi investor is paying 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 billion -rrb- to scoop up a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler , becoming the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder at a time the world auto industry is undergoing its worst crisis in decades .
the gulf-based aabar investments , which is a partially state-owned affiliate of international petroleum investment company -lrb- ipic -rrb- , is paying 20.27 euros a share for the offering , a slight discount from friday 's closing price of 21.55 euros .
daimler had increased its share capital by ten percent to allow aabar to purchase the new equity stake .
besides its main energy interests , aabar has diversified its investments in other sectors such as real estate , financial services and infrastructure projects .
investments are planned " we are delighted to welcome aabar as a new major shareholder that is supportive of our corporate strategy , " said daimler ceo dieter zetsche late on sunday .
zetsche said the deal would give the group extra flexibility to invest in new automotive technologies .
for its part , aabar said it values german technological prowess , and that it would work with daimler on the development of environmentally friendly electric cars , research into new compound materials for the industry , and building a new training center in the emirates capital for nurturing engineering talent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petroleum rich gulf region invests in new energy markets .
the chairman of aabar 's parent company , ipic , is mansour bin zayed al nahyan , an abu dhabi sheikh and member of the royal family who owns the premier soccer club manchester city .
daimler , a pet of gulf investors this is not the first time that daimler , whose flagship brand is mercedes benz , has attracted investors from the gulf region .
daimler 's second-largest shareholder is the state of kuwait , whose stake would be reduced to just under seven percent after aabar 's move .
the aabar investment is a boost for germany 's auto industry as opel , the german subsidiary of beleaguered general motors , is asking berlin for government help .
although daimler is not in the same dire straits as opel , group profits plunged last year when the stuttgart-based giant had to completely write off its losses in us automaker chrysler .
daimler had sold most of its chrysler stake in 2007 , but is struggling with a drop in worldwide demand for its premium cars and trucks .
the company 's net profits for last year plummeted by 65 percent to 1.41 billion euros .
need shareholders ' approval in april most of daimler stock is traded publicly on the frankfurt stock exchange , unlike other german automakers such as bmw , volkswagen and porsche , which have huge family-owned stakes .
although the board has already approved the deal with aabar , shareholders would also have to give it the green light at daimler 's annual meeting on april 9 .

the number of turkish citizens living in germany , however , declined by 25,200 to 1.7 million by year-end in 2008 , due mainly to the number of turks who were granted german citizenship during the course of the entire year .
ethnic turks residing in germany must normally choose between turkish or german citizenship .
even though nationality laws based mainly on descent were eased in 2000 , it is not uncommon for those born in germany to foreigners to assume their parents ' nationality instead . influx from the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law made it easier for those born in germany to foreign parents to become citizens in contrast to the decline in numbers of turkish nationals , the number of foreigners from eu member states rose in the same 12-month period .
the largest numbers of eu foreigners came from countries that had joined the 27-nation bloc since its expansion eastwards in 2004 . the number of poles who settled in germany went up by some 9,000 in 2008 compared to the previous year .
however the biggest percentage gains came from rumania and bulgaria , which were admitted to the european union in 2007 .
the number of rumanian nationals went up by 9,700 in 2008 , up 12 percent from the previous year , while the number of bulgarian citizens rose to 7,200 , up 15 percent from 2007 .
eu passports not very common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign " guest workers " helped fuel the german economic boom about 80 percent of all foreigners living in germany are turkish or european nationals , of which only one third has eu passports .
the rest come from countries that hope to join the eu , such as turkey , croatia , macedonia as well as russia and other countries . decades after the first " guest workers " arrived from turkey during the wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1960s , the turks are still germany 's largest foreign minority , followed by the italians , poles , serbs , greeks , croatians and russians .
nearly all of the 192 nations that are member states of the united nations are represented in germany , reflecting a growing diversity in the entire resident population , which numbers 82 million . most foreigners are long-time residents the majority of foreigners in germany are long time residents of the country .
some 72 percent or nearly five million foreigners have lived in germany for a minimum of eight years and therefore even meet the minimum residency requirements to apply for citizenship . about half of those long-time foreign residents have been in the country for more than twenty years , whereas twenty percent of all foreigners were born in germany .
the average age of foreign residents is 38 years old , a slight rise from 2007 , which suggests that since the 2000 nationality laws took effect , more foreigners born in germany are becoming citizens , according to the statistics office .
in 2008 , there were only 356,400 children under the age of 10 who were foreign nationals , compared to 521,300 in the same age group three years ago . df / tt / dpa / afp / destatis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier . " we are working for safe and attractive conditions for the transit of russian gas , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" there is no intention to exclude russia . " european confidence in ukraine took a hit in january , when a bitter argument between russia and ukraine over prices left europe without access to most russian gas for more than two weeks .
the two countries eventually came to an agreement , but tensions continue to run high . " we can not allow our citizens to experience fuel shortages in the depths of winter again , " said eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner . a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants better monitoring of gas supplies as part of the agreement announced in brussels on monday , the former soviet country laid out a plan to overhaul its gas transit system .
ukraine has agreed to reforms which will include setting up an independent company to oversee the multi-billion-euro project . ukraine 's 40-year-old natural gas system is in desperate need of an upgrade .
experts have estimated that ukraine needs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- over the next few years just to keep its system functioning properly . the european union has a keen interest in having ukraine 's system running smoothly as some 20 percent of the bloc 's natural gas supplies come from russia via ukraine . ukraine 's prime minister yulia tymoshenko told those attending the meeting in brussels that ukraine wants 5.5 billion euros to modernize the current system and also boost capacity . " today 's conference is extremely important for us because europe 's energy security requires an approach based on solidarity and agreement between the eu and ukraine , " tymoshenko said . both tymoshenko and her bitter political rival president viktor yushchenko attended the meeting in brussels and threw their support behind the bilateral declaration . europe hopeful , but cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has asked for foreign investment to upgrade its system analysts say that the pledge signed on monday could sound the death knell for the monopoly of ukrainian gas company naftogaz , which currently both manages the system and provides ukrainian consumers with gas . before aid and investment money begins flowing , ukraine will have to prove it is willing to make big changes , said philippe maystadt , head of the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- . the bank is willing to co-finance the modernization of ukraine 's gas system , but only if it is done in a " commercially sound and transparent way . " the eu currently has monitors in ukraine to check on the flow of russian gas through a key ukrainian pipeline , and the bloc has said it will increase surveillance if necessary to ensure that gas keeps flowing to europe . europe looking at other options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has hoped monitors can keep supplies flowing eu countries , in an effort to avoid being held hostage by future disputes between russia and ukraine , recently agreed to invest 200 million euros in the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas direct from the caspian sea to europe . germany 's deputy economics minister bernd pfaffenbach pointed out that europe 's demand for energy in the future will continue to grow and that it makes sense to " diversify the supply sources and the delivery networks . " german energy company rwe has thrown its support behind the project , said ceo stefan judisch . " with nabucco , german consumers will have more gas , and gas could also become cheaper because there will be more competition , " judisch said . details about how the project will be financed are on the agenda for an eu meeting in prague in may . th / tt / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not have the intention " of taking a direct stake in opel , merkel said during an interview on public television sunday , march 22 .
she added that berlin 's involvement in the company would " not be good news " for opel employees . it was the first time in more than two years that merkel appeared on a talk-show to explain her policies to millions of viewers .
she has , however , used newspaper and radio interviews to defend government policies over the past two weeks . the chancellor is scheduled to visit an opel factory in the town of russelsheim on march 31 . different forms of aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel explained government policy in a tv interview on sunday labor minister olaf scholz , a social democrat in merkel 's governing coalition , had said the government should consider moving in to help the german carmaker , which is a subsidiary of us auto giant general motors . " we should n't be afraid of such a decision , " he said in an interview published in the bild am sonntag newspaper .
but he added that it " should not be for the long-term . " german authorities have criticized a proposal from gm europe regarding opel as too vague and have given themselves several weeks to decide whether to bail out the carmaker , which employs 26,000 people in germany alone . merkel , however , said although the state would n't buy shares in opel , it would support ailing enterprises .
" a bridge should be built for every business that has a chance " to succeed , she said . the back-and-forth over opel , which said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- to avoid bankruptcy , comes ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for september . coalition steers clear of early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from the spd and cdu said they 're committed to the grand coalition - until sept .

" i can only recommend others do the same . " her social democratic coalition partners agreed germany 's largest parties needed to continue working together . " until sept .

as head of the bavarian sister party of the cdu , seehofer 's csu is a junior member in the coalition . while political leaders in the cdu and spd have admitted that the current coalition is not their ideal way to govern , they have consistently refused to hold early elections . sms / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier . " we are working for safe and attractive conditions for the transit of russian gas , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" there is no intention to exclude russia . " european confidence in ukraine took a hit in january , when a bitter argument between russia and ukraine over prices left europe without access to most russian gas for more than two weeks .
the two countries eventually came to an agreement , but tensions continue to run high . " we can not allow our citizens to experience fuel shortages in the depths of winter again , " said eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner . a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants better monitoring of gas supplies as part of the agreement announced in brussels on monday , the former soviet country laid out a plan to overhaul its gas transit system .
ukraine has agreed to reforms which will include setting up an independent company to oversee the multi-billion-euro project . ukraine 's 40-year-old natural gas system is in desperate need of an upgrade .
experts have estimated that ukraine needs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- over the next few years just to keep its system functioning properly . the european union has a keen interest in having ukraine 's system running smoothly as some 20 percent of the bloc 's natural gas supplies come from russia via ukraine . ukraine 's prime minister yulia tymoshenko told those attending the meeting in brussels that ukraine wants 5.5 billion euros to modernize the current system and also boost capacity . " today 's conference is extremely important for us because europe 's energy security requires an approach based on solidarity and agreement between the eu and ukraine , " tymoshenko said . both tymoshenko and her bitter political rival president viktor yushchenko attended the meeting in brussels and threw their support behind the bilateral declaration . europe hopeful , but cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has asked for foreign investment to upgrade its system analysts say that the pledge signed on monday could sound the death knell for the monopoly of ukrainian gas company naftogaz , which currently both manages the system and provides ukrainian consumers with gas . before aid and investment money begins flowing , ukraine will have to prove it is willing to make big changes , said philippe maystadt , head of the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- . the bank is willing to co-finance the modernization of ukraine 's gas system , but only if it is done in a " commercially sound and transparent way . " the eu currently has monitors in ukraine to check on the flow of russian gas through a key ukrainian pipeline , and the bloc has said it will increase surveillance if necessary to ensure that gas keeps flowing to europe . europe looking at other options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has hoped monitors can keep supplies flowing eu countries , in an effort to avoid being held hostage by future disputes between russia and ukraine , recently agreed to invest 200 million euros in the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas direct from the caspian sea to europe . germany 's deputy economics minister bernd pfaffenbach pointed out that europe 's demand for energy in the future will continue to grow and that it makes sense to " diversify the supply sources and the delivery networks . " german energy company rwe has thrown its support behind the project , said ceo stefan judisch . " with nabucco , german consumers will have more gas , and gas could also become cheaper because there will be more competition , " judisch said . details about how the project will be financed are on the agenda for an eu meeting in prague in may . th / tt / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an oil-rich gulf investor , who also owns a premier english soccer club , plans to take a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler .
the move would make aabar investments the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder . an abu dhabi investor is paying 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 billion -rrb- to scoop up a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler , becoming the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder at a time the world auto industry is undergoing its worst crisis in decades .
the gulf-based aabar investments , which is a partially state-owned affiliate of international petroleum investment company -lrb- ipic -rrb- , is paying 20.27 euros a share for the offering , a slight discount from friday 's closing price of 21.55 euros .
daimler had increased its share capital by ten percent to allow aabar to purchase the new equity stake .
besides its main energy interests , aabar has diversified its investments in other sectors such as real estate , financial services and infrastructure projects .
investments are planned " we are delighted to welcome aabar as a new major shareholder that is supportive of our corporate strategy , " said daimler ceo dieter zetsche late on sunday .
zetsche said the deal would give the group extra flexibility to invest in new automotive technologies .
for its part , aabar said it values german technological prowess , and that it would work with daimler on the development of environmentally friendly electric cars , research into new compound materials for the industry , and building a new training center in the emirates capital for nurturing engineering talent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petroleum rich gulf region invests in new energy markets .

daimler , a pet of gulf investors this is not the first time that daimler , whose flagship brand is mercedes benz , has attracted investors from the gulf region .
daimler 's second-largest shareholder is the state of kuwait , whose stake would be reduced to just under seven percent after aabar 's move .
the aabar investment is a boost for germany 's auto industry as opel , the german subsidiary of beleaguered general motors , is asking berlin for government help .
although daimler is not in the same dire straits as opel , group profits plunged last year when the stuttgart-based giant had to completely write off its losses in us automaker chrysler .
daimler had sold most of its chrysler stake in 2007 , but is struggling with a drop in worldwide demand for its premium cars and trucks .
the company 's net profits for last year plummeted by 65 percent to 1.41 billion euros .
need shareholders ' approval in april most of daimler stock is traded publicly on the frankfurt stock exchange , unlike other german automakers such as bmw , volkswagen and porsche , which have huge family-owned stakes .
although the board has already approved the deal with aabar , shareholders would also have to give it the green light at daimler 's annual meeting on april 9 .
in early monday trading , daimler shares jumped more than eight percent on the news . df / jen / dpa / afp / ft send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 23.03.2009 germany urges eu action to halt plunging milk prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dairy farmers say they ca n't make ends meet last summer , german farmers launched a series of " milk strikes " to protest falling prices .
since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of turkish citizens living in germany , however , declined by 25,200 to 1.7 million by year-end in 2008 , due mainly to the number of turks who were granted german citizenship during the course of the entire year .
ethnic turks residing in germany must normally choose between turkish or german citizenship .
even though nationality laws based mainly on descent were eased in 2000 , it is not uncommon for those born in germany to foreigners to assume their parents ' nationality instead . influx from the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law made it easier for those born in germany to foreign parents to become citizens in contrast to the decline in numbers of turkish nationals , the number of foreigners from eu member states rose in the same 12-month period .
the largest numbers of eu foreigners came from countries that had joined the 27-nation bloc since its expansion eastwards in 2004 . the number of poles who settled in germany went up by some 9,000 in 2008 compared to the previous year .
however the biggest percentage gains came from rumania and bulgaria , which were admitted to the european union in 2007 .
the number of rumanian nationals went up by 9,700 in 2008 , up 12 percent from the previous year , while the number of bulgarian citizens rose to 7,200 , up 15 percent from 2007 .
eu passports not very common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign " guest workers " helped fuel the german economic boom about 80 percent of all foreigners living in germany are turkish or european nationals , of which only one third has eu passports .
the rest come from countries that hope to join the eu , such as turkey , croatia , macedonia as well as russia and other countries . decades after the first " guest workers " arrived from turkey during the wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1960s , the turks are still germany 's largest foreign minority , followed by the italians , poles , serbs , greeks , croatians and russians .
nearly all of the 192 nations that are member states of the united nations are represented in germany , reflecting a growing diversity in the entire resident population , which numbers 82 million . most foreigners are long-time residents the majority of foreigners in germany are long time residents of the country .
some 72 percent or nearly five million foreigners have lived in germany for a minimum of eight years and therefore even meet the minimum residency requirements to apply for citizenship . about half of those long-time foreign residents have been in the country for more than twenty years , whereas twenty percent of all foreigners were born in germany .
the average age of foreign residents is 38 years old , a slight rise from 2007 , which suggests that since the 2000 nationality laws took effect , more foreigners born in germany are becoming citizens , according to the statistics office .
in 2008 , there were only 356,400 children under the age of 10 who were foreign nationals , compared to 521,300 in the same age group three years ago . df / tt / dpa / afp / destatis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an oil-rich gulf investor , who also owns a premier english soccer club , plans to take a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler .
the move would make aabar investments the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder . an abu dhabi investor is paying 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 billion -rrb- to scoop up a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler , becoming the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder at a time the world auto industry is undergoing its worst crisis in decades .
the gulf-based aabar investments , which is a partially state-owned affiliate of international petroleum investment company -lrb- ipic -rrb- , is paying 20.27 euros a share for the offering , a slight discount from friday 's closing price of 21.55 euros .
daimler had increased its share capital by ten percent to allow aabar to purchase the new equity stake .
besides its main energy interests , aabar has diversified its investments in other sectors such as real estate , financial services and infrastructure projects .
investments are planned " we are delighted to welcome aabar as a new major shareholder that is supportive of our corporate strategy , " said daimler ceo dieter zetsche late on sunday .
zetsche said the deal would give the group extra flexibility to invest in new automotive technologies .
for its part , aabar said it values german technological prowess , and that it would work with daimler on the development of environmentally friendly electric cars , research into new compound materials for the industry , and building a new training center in the emirates capital for nurturing engineering talent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petroleum rich gulf region invests in new energy markets .
the chairman of aabar 's parent company , ipic , is mansour bin zayed al nahyan , an abu dhabi sheikh and member of the royal family who owns the premier soccer club manchester city .
daimler , a pet of gulf investors this is not the first time that daimler , whose flagship brand is mercedes benz , has attracted investors from the gulf region .
daimler 's second-largest shareholder is the state of kuwait , whose stake would be reduced to just under seven percent after aabar 's move .
the aabar investment is a boost for germany 's auto industry as opel , the german subsidiary of beleaguered general motors , is asking berlin for government help .
although daimler is not in the same dire straits as opel , group profits plunged last year when the stuttgart-based giant had to completely write off its losses in us automaker chrysler .
daimler had sold most of its chrysler stake in 2007 , but is struggling with a drop in worldwide demand for its premium cars and trucks .
the company 's net profits for last year plummeted by 65 percent to 1.41 billion euros .
need shareholders ' approval in april most of daimler stock is traded publicly on the frankfurt stock exchange , unlike other german automakers such as bmw , volkswagen and porsche , which have huge family-owned stakes .
although the board has already approved the deal with aabar , shareholders would also have to give it the green light at daimler 's annual meeting on april 9 .

since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of turkish citizens living in germany , however , declined by 25,200 to 1.7 million by year-end in 2008 , due mainly to the number of turks who were granted german citizenship during the course of the entire year .
ethnic turks residing in germany must normally choose between turkish or german citizenship .
even though nationality laws based mainly on descent were eased in 2000 , it is not uncommon for those born in germany to foreigners to assume their parents ' nationality instead . influx from the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law made it easier for those born in germany to foreign parents to become citizens in contrast to the decline in numbers of turkish nationals , the number of foreigners from eu member states rose in the same 12-month period .
the largest numbers of eu foreigners came from countries that had joined the 27-nation bloc since its expansion eastwards in 2004 . the number of poles who settled in germany went up by some 9,000 in 2008 compared to the previous year .
however the biggest percentage gains came from rumania and bulgaria , which were admitted to the european union in 2007 .
the number of rumanian nationals went up by 9,700 in 2008 , up 12 percent from the previous year , while the number of bulgarian citizens rose to 7,200 , up 15 percent from 2007 .
eu passports not very common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign " guest workers " helped fuel the german economic boom about 80 percent of all foreigners living in germany are turkish or european nationals , of which only one third has eu passports .
the rest come from countries that hope to join the eu , such as turkey , croatia , macedonia as well as russia and other countries . decades after the first " guest workers " arrived from turkey during the wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1960s , the turks are still germany 's largest foreign minority , followed by the italians , poles , serbs , greeks , croatians and russians .
nearly all of the 192 nations that are member states of the united nations are represented in germany , reflecting a growing diversity in the entire resident population , which numbers 82 million . most foreigners are long-time residents the majority of foreigners in germany are long time residents of the country .
some 72 percent or nearly five million foreigners have lived in germany for a minimum of eight years and therefore even meet the minimum residency requirements to apply for citizenship . about half of those long-time foreign residents have been in the country for more than twenty years , whereas twenty percent of all foreigners were born in germany .
the average age of foreign residents is 38 years old , a slight rise from 2007 , which suggests that since the 2000 nationality laws took effect , more foreigners born in germany are becoming citizens , according to the statistics office .
in 2008 , there were only 356,400 children under the age of 10 who were foreign nationals , compared to 521,300 in the same age group three years ago . df / tt / dpa / afp / destatis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier . " we are working for safe and attractive conditions for the transit of russian gas , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" there is no intention to exclude russia . " european confidence in ukraine took a hit in january , when a bitter argument between russia and ukraine over prices left europe without access to most russian gas for more than two weeks .
the two countries eventually came to an agreement , but tensions continue to run high . " we can not allow our citizens to experience fuel shortages in the depths of winter again , " said eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner . a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants better monitoring of gas supplies as part of the agreement announced in brussels on monday , the former soviet country laid out a plan to overhaul its gas transit system .
ukraine has agreed to reforms which will include setting up an independent company to oversee the multi-billion-euro project . ukraine 's 40-year-old natural gas system is in desperate need of an upgrade .
experts have estimated that ukraine needs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- over the next few years just to keep its system functioning properly . the european union has a keen interest in having ukraine 's system running smoothly as some 20 percent of the bloc 's natural gas supplies come from russia via ukraine . ukraine 's prime minister yulia tymoshenko told those attending the meeting in brussels that ukraine wants 5.5 billion euros to modernize the current system and also boost capacity . " today 's conference is extremely important for us because europe 's energy security requires an approach based on solidarity and agreement between the eu and ukraine , " tymoshenko said . both tymoshenko and her bitter political rival president viktor yushchenko attended the meeting in brussels and threw their support behind the bilateral declaration . europe hopeful , but cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has asked for foreign investment to upgrade its system analysts say that the pledge signed on monday could sound the death knell for the monopoly of ukrainian gas company naftogaz , which currently both manages the system and provides ukrainian consumers with gas . before aid and investment money begins flowing , ukraine will have to prove it is willing to make big changes , said philippe maystadt , head of the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- . the bank is willing to co-finance the modernization of ukraine 's gas system , but only if it is done in a " commercially sound and transparent way .

an oil-rich gulf investor , who also owns a premier english soccer club , plans to take a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler .
the move would make aabar investments the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder . an abu dhabi investor is paying 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 billion -rrb- to scoop up a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler , becoming the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder at a time the world auto industry is undergoing its worst crisis in decades .
the gulf-based aabar investments , which is a partially state-owned affiliate of international petroleum investment company -lrb- ipic -rrb- , is paying 20.27 euros a share for the offering , a slight discount from friday 's closing price of 21.55 euros .
daimler had increased its share capital by ten percent to allow aabar to purchase the new equity stake .
besides its main energy interests , aabar has diversified its investments in other sectors such as real estate , financial services and infrastructure projects .
investments are planned " we are delighted to welcome aabar as a new major shareholder that is supportive of our corporate strategy , " said daimler ceo dieter zetsche late on sunday .
zetsche said the deal would give the group extra flexibility to invest in new automotive technologies .
for its part , aabar said it values german technological prowess , and that it would work with daimler on the development of environmentally friendly electric cars , research into new compound materials for the industry , and building a new training center in the emirates capital for nurturing engineering talent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petroleum rich gulf region invests in new energy markets .
the chairman of aabar 's parent company , ipic , is mansour bin zayed al nahyan , an abu dhabi sheikh and member of the royal family who owns the premier soccer club manchester city .
daimler , a pet of gulf investors this is not the first time that daimler , whose flagship brand is mercedes benz , has attracted investors from the gulf region .
daimler 's second-largest shareholder is the state of kuwait , whose stake would be reduced to just under seven percent after aabar 's move .
the aabar investment is a boost for germany 's auto industry as opel , the german subsidiary of beleaguered general motors , is asking berlin for government help .
although daimler is not in the same dire straits as opel , group profits plunged last year when the stuttgart-based giant had to completely write off its losses in us automaker chrysler .
daimler had sold most of its chrysler stake in 2007 , but is struggling with a drop in worldwide demand for its premium cars and trucks .
the company 's net profits for last year plummeted by 65 percent to 1.41 billion euros .
need shareholders ' approval in april most of daimler stock is traded publicly on the frankfurt stock exchange , unlike other german automakers such as bmw , volkswagen and porsche , which have huge family-owned stakes .
although the board has already approved the deal with aabar , shareholders would also have to give it the green light at daimler 's annual meeting on april 9 .
in early monday trading , daimler shares jumped more than eight percent on the news . df / jen / dpa / afp / ft send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of turkish citizens living in germany , however , declined by 25,200 to 1.7 million by year-end in 2008 , due mainly to the number of turks who were granted german citizenship during the course of the entire year .
ethnic turks residing in germany must normally choose between turkish or german citizenship .
even though nationality laws based mainly on descent were eased in 2000 , it is not uncommon for those born in germany to foreigners to assume their parents ' nationality instead . influx from the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law made it easier for those born in germany to foreign parents to become citizens in contrast to the decline in numbers of turkish nationals , the number of foreigners from eu member states rose in the same 12-month period .
the largest numbers of eu foreigners came from countries that had joined the 27-nation bloc since its expansion eastwards in 2004 . the number of poles who settled in germany went up by some 9,000 in 2008 compared to the previous year .
however the biggest percentage gains came from rumania and bulgaria , which were admitted to the european union in 2007 .
the number of rumanian nationals went up by 9,700 in 2008 , up 12 percent from the previous year , while the number of bulgarian citizens rose to 7,200 , up 15 percent from 2007 .
eu passports not very common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign " guest workers " helped fuel the german economic boom about 80 percent of all foreigners living in germany are turkish or european nationals , of which only one third has eu passports .
the rest come from countries that hope to join the eu , such as turkey , croatia , macedonia as well as russia and other countries . decades after the first " guest workers " arrived from turkey during the wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1960s , the turks are still germany 's largest foreign minority , followed by the italians , poles , serbs , greeks , croatians and russians .
nearly all of the 192 nations that are member states of the united nations are represented in germany , reflecting a growing diversity in the entire resident population , which numbers 82 million . most foreigners are long-time residents the majority of foreigners in germany are long time residents of the country .
some 72 percent or nearly five million foreigners have lived in germany for a minimum of eight years and therefore even meet the minimum residency requirements to apply for citizenship . about half of those long-time foreign residents have been in the country for more than twenty years , whereas twenty percent of all foreigners were born in germany .
the average age of foreign residents is 38 years old , a slight rise from 2007 , which suggests that since the 2000 nationality laws took effect , more foreigners born in germany are becoming citizens , according to the statistics office .
in 2008 , there were only 356,400 children under the age of 10 who were foreign nationals , compared to 521,300 in the same age group three years ago . df / tt / dpa / afp / destatis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but german politicians are more concerned with the dispute 's political consequences . swiss defense minsiter ueli maurer has replaced the mercedes s430 he used to ride in , with a renault espace .
the symbolic move is meant to show his discontent with the ongoing tax-haven disagreement between switzerland and germany . " the tax dispute has annoyed and angered him so much that he has switched to another pool car , " maurer 's spokesman said sunday , march 22 . the quarrel began last week when german finance minister peer steinbrueck said the swiss were like indians running scared from a cavalry ready to enforce international banking laws .
in return , a swiss politician compared steinbrueck to a nazi . a domestic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a renault is edging out mercedes in switzerland herbert scheidt , the head of zurich-based vontobel banking group , accused steinbrueck of running roughshod over swiss interests . " as a german , i find the virulent and rough behavior shown by the finance minster of the last days and weeks to be particularly regrettable , " scheidt told the welt am sonntag newspaper , adding that the swiss view of tax law was something berlin has to accept for the time being . while swiss politicians decry what they see as foreign interference in their domestic affairs , germans have accused steinbrueck of tarnishing germany 's image abroad . " the completely inappropriate way the finance minster has expressed himself to switzerland in the legitimate fight against tax havens is inacceptable , " volker kauder , the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group leader , told the leipziger volkszeitung on monday . punishing german banks steinbrueck has said he would be willing to meet his swiss counterpart but justified his remarks saying he had learned to " formulate his remarks regarding tax havens in switzerland in an unambiguous way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin may try to put an end to non-transparent banking deals part of the unambiguous action could be punishing german banks with subsidiaries in switzerland , according to a report in the german newsmagazine der spiegel . the office responsible for administrating germany 's financial sector bailout funds -lrb- bafin -rrb- reportedly requested information from banks about their operations in switzerland and liechtenstein , to ensure regulations dealing with the prevention of money laundering were being met . according to the magazine , the banks will be forced to end " non-transparent business relationships . " spiegel said a swiss subsidiary of deutsche bank administered accounts held by foundations in liechtenstein .
foundations in the alpine principality have been used by tax evaders , including former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel , to hide money from authorities . deutsche bank as well as other banks with swiss subsidiaries , including commerzbank and dresdner bank , did not comment on the spiegel report . the organization for economic cooperation and development has named liechtenstein , monaco and andorra as uncooperative tax havens . sms / jen / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not have the intention " of taking a direct stake in opel , merkel said during an interview on public television sunday , march 22 .
she added that berlin 's involvement in the company would " not be good news " for opel employees . it was the first time in more than two years that merkel appeared on a talk-show to explain her policies to millions of viewers .
she has , however , used newspaper and radio interviews to defend government policies over the past two weeks . the chancellor is scheduled to visit an opel factory in the town of russelsheim on march 31 . different forms of aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel explained government policy in a tv interview on sunday labor minister olaf scholz , a social democrat in merkel 's governing coalition , had said the government should consider moving in to help the german carmaker , which is a subsidiary of us auto giant general motors . " we should n't be afraid of such a decision , " he said in an interview published in the bild am sonntag newspaper .
but he added that it " should not be for the long-term .

since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of turkish citizens living in germany , however , declined by 25,200 to 1.7 million by year-end in 2008 , due mainly to the number of turks who were granted german citizenship during the course of the entire year .
ethnic turks residing in germany must normally choose between turkish or german citizenship .
even though nationality laws based mainly on descent were eased in 2000 , it is not uncommon for those born in germany to foreigners to assume their parents ' nationality instead . influx from the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law made it easier for those born in germany to foreign parents to become citizens in contrast to the decline in numbers of turkish nationals , the number of foreigners from eu member states rose in the same 12-month period .
the largest numbers of eu foreigners came from countries that had joined the 27-nation bloc since its expansion eastwards in 2004 . the number of poles who settled in germany went up by some 9,000 in 2008 compared to the previous year .
however the biggest percentage gains came from rumania and bulgaria , which were admitted to the european union in 2007 .
the number of rumanian nationals went up by 9,700 in 2008 , up 12 percent from the previous year , while the number of bulgarian citizens rose to 7,200 , up 15 percent from 2007 .
eu passports not very common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign " guest workers " helped fuel the german economic boom about 80 percent of all foreigners living in germany are turkish or european nationals , of which only one third has eu passports .
the rest come from countries that hope to join the eu , such as turkey , croatia , macedonia as well as russia and other countries . decades after the first " guest workers " arrived from turkey during the wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1960s , the turks are still germany 's largest foreign minority , followed by the italians , poles , serbs , greeks , croatians and russians .
nearly all of the 192 nations that are member states of the united nations are represented in germany , reflecting a growing diversity in the entire resident population , which numbers 82 million . most foreigners are long-time residents the majority of foreigners in germany are long time residents of the country .
some 72 percent or nearly five million foreigners have lived in germany for a minimum of eight years and therefore even meet the minimum residency requirements to apply for citizenship . about half of those long-time foreign residents have been in the country for more than twenty years , whereas twenty percent of all foreigners were born in germany .
the average age of foreign residents is 38 years old , a slight rise from 2007 , which suggests that since the 2000 nationality laws took effect , more foreigners born in germany are becoming citizens , according to the statistics office .
in 2008 , there were only 356,400 children under the age of 10 who were foreign nationals , compared to 521,300 in the same age group three years ago . df / tt / dpa / afp / destatis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of turkish citizens living in germany , however , declined by 25,200 to 1.7 million by year-end in 2008 , due mainly to the number of turks who were granted german citizenship during the course of the entire year .
ethnic turks residing in germany must normally choose between turkish or german citizenship .
even though nationality laws based mainly on descent were eased in 2000 , it is not uncommon for those born in germany to foreigners to assume their parents ' nationality instead . influx from the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law made it easier for those born in germany to foreign parents to become citizens in contrast to the decline in numbers of turkish nationals , the number of foreigners from eu member states rose in the same 12-month period .
the largest numbers of eu foreigners came from countries that had joined the 27-nation bloc since its expansion eastwards in 2004 . the number of poles who settled in germany went up by some 9,000 in 2008 compared to the previous year .
however the biggest percentage gains came from rumania and bulgaria , which were admitted to the european union in 2007 .

nearly all of the 192 nations that are member states of the united nations are represented in germany , reflecting a growing diversity in the entire resident population , which numbers 82 million . most foreigners are long-time residents the majority of foreigners in germany are long time residents of the country .

the average age of foreign residents is 38 years old , a slight rise from 2007 , which suggests that since the 2000 nationality laws took effect , more foreigners born in germany are becoming citizens , according to the statistics office .

the move would make aabar investments the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder . an abu dhabi investor is paying 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 billion -rrb- to scoop up a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler , becoming the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder at a time the world auto industry is undergoing its worst crisis in decades .
the gulf-based aabar investments , which is a partially state-owned affiliate of international petroleum investment company -lrb- ipic -rrb- , is paying 20.27 euros a share for the offering , a slight discount from friday 's closing price of 21.55 euros .
daimler had increased its share capital by ten percent to allow aabar to purchase the new equity stake .
besides its main energy interests , aabar has diversified its investments in other sectors such as real estate , financial services and infrastructure projects .
investments are planned " we are delighted to welcome aabar as a new major shareholder that is supportive of our corporate strategy , " said daimler ceo dieter zetsche late on sunday .
zetsche said the deal would give the group extra flexibility to invest in new automotive technologies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 23.03.2009 germany urges eu action to halt plunging milk prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dairy farmers say they ca n't make ends meet last summer , german farmers launched a series of " milk strikes " to protest falling prices .
since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier . " we are working for safe and attractive conditions for the transit of russian gas , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" there is no intention to exclude russia . " european confidence in ukraine took a hit in january , when a bitter argument between russia and ukraine over prices left europe without access to most russian gas for more than two weeks .
the two countries eventually came to an agreement , but tensions continue to run high . " we can not allow our citizens to experience fuel shortages in the depths of winter again , " said eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner . a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants better monitoring of gas supplies as part of the agreement announced in brussels on monday , the former soviet country laid out a plan to overhaul its gas transit system .
ukraine has agreed to reforms which will include setting up an independent company to oversee the multi-billion-euro project . ukraine 's 40-year-old natural gas system is in desperate need of an upgrade .
experts have estimated that ukraine needs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- over the next few years just to keep its system functioning properly . the european union has a keen interest in having ukraine 's system running smoothly as some 20 percent of the bloc 's natural gas supplies come from russia via ukraine . ukraine 's prime minister yulia tymoshenko told those attending the meeting in brussels that ukraine wants 5.5 billion euros to modernize the current system and also boost capacity . " today 's conference is extremely important for us because europe 's energy security requires an approach based on solidarity and agreement between the eu and ukraine , " tymoshenko said . both tymoshenko and her bitter political rival president viktor yushchenko attended the meeting in brussels and threw their support behind the bilateral declaration . europe hopeful , but cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has asked for foreign investment to upgrade its system analysts say that the pledge signed on monday could sound the death knell for the monopoly of ukrainian gas company naftogaz , which currently both manages the system and provides ukrainian consumers with gas . before aid and investment money begins flowing , ukraine will have to prove it is willing to make big changes , said philippe maystadt , head of the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- . the bank is willing to co-finance the modernization of ukraine 's gas system , but only if it is done in a " commercially sound and transparent way . " the eu currently has monitors in ukraine to check on the flow of russian gas through a key ukrainian pipeline , and the bloc has said it will increase surveillance if necessary to ensure that gas keeps flowing to europe . europe looking at other options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has hoped monitors can keep supplies flowing eu countries , in an effort to avoid being held hostage by future disputes between russia and ukraine , recently agreed to invest 200 million euros in the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas direct from the caspian sea to europe . germany 's deputy economics minister bernd pfaffenbach pointed out that europe 's demand for energy in the future will continue to grow and that it makes sense to " diversify the supply sources and the delivery networks . " german energy company rwe has thrown its support behind the project , said ceo stefan judisch . " with nabucco , german consumers will have more gas , and gas could also become cheaper because there will be more competition , " judisch said . details about how the project will be financed are on the agenda for an eu meeting in prague in may . th / tt / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 23.03.2009 germany urges eu action to halt plunging milk prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dairy farmers say they ca n't make ends meet last summer , german farmers launched a series of " milk strikes " to protest falling prices .
since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even though nationality laws based mainly on descent were eased in 2000 , it is not uncommon for those born in germany to foreigners to assume their parents ' nationality instead . influx from the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law made it easier for those born in germany to foreign parents to become citizens in contrast to the decline in numbers of turkish nationals , the number of foreigners from eu member states rose in the same 12-month period .
the largest numbers of eu foreigners came from countries that had joined the 27-nation bloc since its expansion eastwards in 2004 . the number of poles who settled in germany went up by some 9,000 in 2008 compared to the previous year .
however the biggest percentage gains came from rumania and bulgaria , which were admitted to the european union in 2007 .
the number of rumanian nationals went up by 9,700 in 2008 , up 12 percent from the previous year , while the number of bulgarian citizens rose to 7,200 , up 15 percent from 2007 .
eu passports not very common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign " guest workers " helped fuel the german economic boom about 80 percent of all foreigners living in germany are turkish or european nationals , of which only one third has eu passports .
the rest come from countries that hope to join the eu , such as turkey , croatia , macedonia as well as russia and other countries . decades after the first " guest workers " arrived from turkey during the wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1960s , the turks are still germany 's largest foreign minority , followed by the italians , poles , serbs , greeks , croatians and russians .
nearly all of the 192 nations that are member states of the united nations are represented in germany , reflecting a growing diversity in the entire resident population , which numbers 82 million . most foreigners are long-time residents the majority of foreigners in germany are long time residents of the country .
some 72 percent or nearly five million foreigners have lived in germany for a minimum of eight years and therefore even meet the minimum residency requirements to apply for citizenship . about half of those long-time foreign residents have been in the country for more than twenty years , whereas twenty percent of all foreigners were born in germany .
the average age of foreign residents is 38 years old , a slight rise from 2007 , which suggests that since the 2000 nationality laws took effect , more foreigners born in germany are becoming citizens , according to the statistics office .
in 2008 , there were only 356,400 children under the age of 10 who were foreign nationals , compared to 521,300 in the same age group three years ago . df / tt / dpa / afp / destatis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier .

the gulf-based aabar investments , which is a partially state-owned affiliate of international petroleum investment company -lrb- ipic -rrb- , is paying 20.27 euros a share for the offering , a slight discount from friday 's closing price of 21.55 euros .
daimler had increased its share capital by ten percent to allow aabar to purchase the new equity stake .

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier . " we are working for safe and attractive conditions for the transit of russian gas , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" there is no intention to exclude russia . " european confidence in ukraine took a hit in january , when a bitter argument between russia and ukraine over prices left europe without access to most russian gas for more than two weeks .
the two countries eventually came to an agreement , but tensions continue to run high . " we can not allow our citizens to experience fuel shortages in the depths of winter again , " said eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner . a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants better monitoring of gas supplies as part of the agreement announced in brussels on monday , the former soviet country laid out a plan to overhaul its gas transit system .
ukraine has agreed to reforms which will include setting up an independent company to oversee the multi-billion-euro project . ukraine 's 40-year-old natural gas system is in desperate need of an upgrade .
experts have estimated that ukraine needs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- over the next few years just to keep its system functioning properly . the european union has a keen interest in having ukraine 's system running smoothly as some 20 percent of the bloc 's natural gas supplies come from russia via ukraine . ukraine 's prime minister yulia tymoshenko told those attending the meeting in brussels that ukraine wants 5.5 billion euros to modernize the current system and also boost capacity . " today 's conference is extremely important for us because europe 's energy security requires an approach based on solidarity and agreement between the eu and ukraine , " tymoshenko said . both tymoshenko and her bitter political rival president viktor yushchenko attended the meeting in brussels and threw their support behind the bilateral declaration . europe hopeful , but cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has asked for foreign investment to upgrade its system analysts say that the pledge signed on monday could sound the death knell for the monopoly of ukrainian gas company naftogaz , which currently both manages the system and provides ukrainian consumers with gas . before aid and investment money begins flowing , ukraine will have to prove it is willing to make big changes , said philippe maystadt , head of the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- . the bank is willing to co-finance the modernization of ukraine 's gas system , but only if it is done in a " commercially sound and transparent way . " the eu currently has monitors in ukraine to check on the flow of russian gas through a key ukrainian pipeline , and the bloc has said it will increase surveillance if necessary to ensure that gas keeps flowing to europe . europe looking at other options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has hoped monitors can keep supplies flowing eu countries , in an effort to avoid being held hostage by future disputes between russia and ukraine , recently agreed to invest 200 million euros in the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas direct from the caspian sea to europe . germany 's deputy economics minister bernd pfaffenbach pointed out that europe 's demand for energy in the future will continue to grow and that it makes sense to " diversify the supply sources and the delivery networks . " german energy company rwe has thrown its support behind the project , said ceo stefan judisch . " with nabucco , german consumers will have more gas , and gas could also become cheaper because there will be more competition , " judisch said . details about how the project will be financed are on the agenda for an eu meeting in prague in may . th / tt / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she added that berlin 's involvement in the company would " not be good news " for opel employees . it was the first time in more than two years that merkel appeared on a talk-show to explain her policies to millions of viewers .

" i can only recommend others do the same . " her social democratic coalition partners agreed germany 's largest parties needed to continue working together . " until sept .

as head of the bavarian sister party of the cdu , seehofer 's csu is a junior member in the coalition . while political leaders in the cdu and spd have admitted that the current coalition is not their ideal way to govern , they have consistently refused to hold early elections . sms / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not have the intention " of taking a direct stake in opel , merkel said during an interview on public television sunday , march 22 .
she added that berlin 's involvement in the company would " not be good news " for opel employees . it was the first time in more than two years that merkel appeared on a talk-show to explain her policies to millions of viewers .
she has , however , used newspaper and radio interviews to defend government policies over the past two weeks . the chancellor is scheduled to visit an opel factory in the town of russelsheim on march 31 . different forms of aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel explained government policy in a tv interview on sunday labor minister olaf scholz , a social democrat in merkel 's governing coalition , had said the government should consider moving in to help the german carmaker , which is a subsidiary of us auto giant general motors . " we should n't be afraid of such a decision , " he said in an interview published in the bild am sonntag newspaper .
but he added that it " should not be for the long-term . " german authorities have criticized a proposal from gm europe regarding opel as too vague and have given themselves several weeks to decide whether to bail out the carmaker , which employs 26,000 people in germany alone . merkel , however , said although the state would n't buy shares in opel , it would support ailing enterprises .
" a bridge should be built for every business that has a chance " to succeed , she said . the back-and-forth over opel , which said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- to avoid bankruptcy , comes ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for september . coalition steers clear of early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from the spd and cdu said they 're committed to the grand coalition - until sept .
27 some in germany , however , would rather see the public headed to the voting box in less than six months .
that 's a plan both merkel and the social democrats are against . " i as chancellor will fulfill my obligations in this coalition for the period that we 've been elected , " merkel said .
" i can only recommend others do the same . " her social democratic coalition partners agreed germany 's largest parties needed to continue working together . " until sept .
27 , we need to jointly solve the problems ahead of us this year , " deputy spd leader andrea nahles said on german rbb radio on monday , in reference to the election date . opposition members and lobby groups have been calling for the end of the current " grand coalition " of christian and social democrats nearly since the day of its inception in 2005 , recent calls have come from free-market liberal leader guido westerwelle as well christian social union leader horst seehofer , who called for the spd to leave government .
as head of the bavarian sister party of the cdu , seehofer 's csu is a junior member in the coalition . while political leaders in the cdu and spd have admitted that the current coalition is not their ideal way to govern , they have consistently refused to hold early elections . sms / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier . " we are working for safe and attractive conditions for the transit of russian gas , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" there is no intention to exclude russia . " european confidence in ukraine took a hit in january , when a bitter argument between russia and ukraine over prices left europe without access to most russian gas for more than two weeks .
the two countries eventually came to an agreement , but tensions continue to run high . " we can not allow our citizens to experience fuel shortages in the depths of winter again , " said eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner . a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants better monitoring of gas supplies as part of the agreement announced in brussels on monday , the former soviet country laid out a plan to overhaul its gas transit system .
ukraine has agreed to reforms which will include setting up an independent company to oversee the multi-billion-euro project . ukraine 's 40-year-old natural gas system is in desperate need of an upgrade .

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union .

since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but german politicians are more concerned with the dispute 's political consequences . swiss defense minsiter ueli maurer has replaced the mercedes s430 he used to ride in , with a renault espace .
the symbolic move is meant to show his discontent with the ongoing tax-haven disagreement between switzerland and germany . " the tax dispute has annoyed and angered him so much that he has switched to another pool car , " maurer 's spokesman said sunday , march 22 . the quarrel began last week when german finance minister peer steinbrueck said the swiss were like indians running scared from a cavalry ready to enforce international banking laws .
in return , a swiss politician compared steinbrueck to a nazi . a domestic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a renault is edging out mercedes in switzerland herbert scheidt , the head of zurich-based vontobel banking group , accused steinbrueck of running roughshod over swiss interests . " as a german , i find the virulent and rough behavior shown by the finance minster of the last days and weeks to be particularly regrettable , " scheidt told the welt am sonntag newspaper , adding that the swiss view of tax law was something berlin has to accept for the time being . while swiss politicians decry what they see as foreign interference in their domestic affairs , germans have accused steinbrueck of tarnishing germany 's image abroad . " the completely inappropriate way the finance minster has expressed himself to switzerland in the legitimate fight against tax havens is inacceptable , " volker kauder , the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group leader , told the leipziger volkszeitung on monday . punishing german banks steinbrueck has said he would be willing to meet his swiss counterpart but justified his remarks saying he had learned to " formulate his remarks regarding tax havens in switzerland in an unambiguous way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin may try to put an end to non-transparent banking deals part of the unambiguous action could be punishing german banks with subsidiaries in switzerland , according to a report in the german newsmagazine der spiegel . the office responsible for administrating germany 's financial sector bailout funds -lrb- bafin -rrb- reportedly requested information from banks about their operations in switzerland and liechtenstein , to ensure regulations dealing with the prevention of money laundering were being met . according to the magazine , the banks will be forced to end " non-transparent business relationships . " spiegel said a swiss subsidiary of deutsche bank administered accounts held by foundations in liechtenstein .
foundations in the alpine principality have been used by tax evaders , including former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel , to hide money from authorities . deutsche bank as well as other banks with swiss subsidiaries , including commerzbank and dresdner bank , did not comment on the spiegel report . the organization for economic cooperation and development has named liechtenstein , monaco and andorra as uncooperative tax havens . sms / jen / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of turkish citizens living in germany , however , declined by 25,200 to 1.7 million by year-end in 2008 , due mainly to the number of turks who were granted german citizenship during the course of the entire year .
ethnic turks residing in germany must normally choose between turkish or german citizenship .
even though nationality laws based mainly on descent were eased in 2000 , it is not uncommon for those born in germany to foreigners to assume their parents ' nationality instead . influx from the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law made it easier for those born in germany to foreign parents to become citizens in contrast to the decline in numbers of turkish nationals , the number of foreigners from eu member states rose in the same 12-month period .
the largest numbers of eu foreigners came from countries that had joined the 27-nation bloc since its expansion eastwards in 2004 . the number of poles who settled in germany went up by some 9,000 in 2008 compared to the previous year .
however the biggest percentage gains came from rumania and bulgaria , which were admitted to the european union in 2007 .
the number of rumanian nationals went up by 9,700 in 2008 , up 12 percent from the previous year , while the number of bulgarian citizens rose to 7,200 , up 15 percent from 2007 .
eu passports not very common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign " guest workers " helped fuel the german economic boom about 80 percent of all foreigners living in germany are turkish or european nationals , of which only one third has eu passports .
the rest come from countries that hope to join the eu , such as turkey , croatia , macedonia as well as russia and other countries . decades after the first " guest workers " arrived from turkey during the wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1960s , the turks are still germany 's largest foreign minority , followed by the italians , poles , serbs , greeks , croatians and russians .
nearly all of the 192 nations that are member states of the united nations are represented in germany , reflecting a growing diversity in the entire resident population , which numbers 82 million . most foreigners are long-time residents the majority of foreigners in germany are long time residents of the country .
some 72 percent or nearly five million foreigners have lived in germany for a minimum of eight years and therefore even meet the minimum residency requirements to apply for citizenship . about half of those long-time foreign residents have been in the country for more than twenty years , whereas twenty percent of all foreigners were born in germany .
the average age of foreign residents is 38 years old , a slight rise from 2007 , which suggests that since the 2000 nationality laws took effect , more foreigners born in germany are becoming citizens , according to the statistics office .
in 2008 , there were only 356,400 children under the age of 10 who were foreign nationals , compared to 521,300 in the same age group three years ago . df / tt / dpa / afp / destatis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of turkish citizens living in germany , however , declined by 25,200 to 1.7 million by year-end in 2008 , due mainly to the number of turks who were granted german citizenship during the course of the entire year .
ethnic turks residing in germany must normally choose between turkish or german citizenship .

the largest numbers of eu foreigners came from countries that had joined the 27-nation bloc since its expansion eastwards in 2004 . the number of poles who settled in germany went up by some 9,000 in 2008 compared to the previous year .
however the biggest percentage gains came from rumania and bulgaria , which were admitted to the european union in 2007 .

nearly all of the 192 nations that are member states of the united nations are represented in germany , reflecting a growing diversity in the entire resident population , which numbers 82 million . most foreigners are long-time residents the majority of foreigners in germany are long time residents of the country .

the average age of foreign residents is 38 years old , a slight rise from 2007 , which suggests that since the 2000 nationality laws took effect , more foreigners born in germany are becoming citizens , according to the statistics office .

since then , milk prices have continued to fall .
germany now wants the european union to re-think its position on milk quotas . last summer , german farmers dumped their milk down the drain to protest low milk prices .
yet prices have fallen to half of what they were little over a year ago , with german farmers getting a mere 20 to 25 cents per liter -lrb- $ 1 to $ 1.28 per gallon -rrb- of milk .
germany and several other european countries now want the eu to postpone a planned milk quota increase which they fear could further hurt milk prices .
" the situation has changed dramatically as far as price is concerned , " german agriculture minister ilse aigner said as she arrived at a meeting in brussels on monday , march 23 , to discuss the milk issue with her eu counterparts .
dairy farmers considering more strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to lift all milk quotas by 2015 prices under 40 cents a liter mean a loss for farmers , aigner said .
and dairy farmers are going out of business at a rate of three to five percent each year , reinhard pauw , head of the dairy farming association for the state of north rhine-westphalia , said at a press conference on monday .
" twenty-five cents per liter is not even enough to cover production costs , " pauw said .
it is not enough to live on and certainly not enough to make investments with . "
he noted that butter is currently as cheap as it was in 1948 .
german milk exports are down , pauw said , while countries such as the united states are exporting milk at high volumes .
pauw said farmers were also getting squeezed by grocery store chains who want to offer low prices while still making a profit .
germany 's milk producers federation bdm has said it might launch additional " milk strikes " unless prices increase .
some 8,000 farmers across eastern europe protested falling prices earlier this month .
eu says decision is final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers have threatened another milk strike yet eu leaders said they are not eager to re-open the milk issue .
the eu 's decision to gradually lift milk quotas was part of a broader dairy reform agreed to by all 27 member countries just last year .
" i am not ready to discuss a complete re-orientation of the eu dairy policy as suggested by some of you , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said at monday 's meeting .
" the problem we are facing today is not the result of increased production in the eu but rather the combination of increased production in a number of third countries ... and a decreasing demand in the eu and on the world market , " she said .
quotas were introduced in 1984 to try and do away with europe 's " butter mountains " and " milk lakes . "
last november , the 27 eu agriculture ministers agreed to lift milk quotas by one percent each year before doing away with them altogether by 2015 .
eu wants quotas lifted germany , austria , hungary , slovakia and slovenia circulated a joint note to the european commission and other national eu delegations which said that " unconventional approaches " are needed to stop prices from falling further .
" if it was up to me , we 'd keep the milk quotas in some form or another , " because " we have to be very careful not to exacerbate the current overproduction , " french agriculture minister michel barnier said .
but the eu insists that quotas are not the problem .
fischer boel pointed out that eu milk production was 4 percent below the maximum allowed quota this year and that the same was expected for next year .
" this clearly shows that farmers understand that it is market prices and their cost structure rather than the quota levels that should determine their production decisions , " she said .
" quotas are not an obligation to produce , but a possibility . "
" we should therefore stop this purely political discussion and focus on the real economic problem , " boel told the ministers . th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of turkish citizens living in germany , however , declined by 25,200 to 1.7 million by year-end in 2008 , due mainly to the number of turks who were granted german citizenship during the course of the entire year .
ethnic turks residing in germany must normally choose between turkish or german citizenship .
even though nationality laws based mainly on descent were eased in 2000 , it is not uncommon for those born in germany to foreigners to assume their parents ' nationality instead . influx from the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law made it easier for those born in germany to foreign parents to become citizens in contrast to the decline in numbers of turkish nationals , the number of foreigners from eu member states rose in the same 12-month period .
the largest numbers of eu foreigners came from countries that had joined the 27-nation bloc since its expansion eastwards in 2004 . the number of poles who settled in germany went up by some 9,000 in 2008 compared to the previous year .
however the biggest percentage gains came from rumania and bulgaria , which were admitted to the european union in 2007 .
the number of rumanian nationals went up by 9,700 in 2008 , up 12 percent from the previous year , while the number of bulgarian citizens rose to 7,200 , up 15 percent from 2007 .
eu passports not very common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign " guest workers " helped fuel the german economic boom about 80 percent of all foreigners living in germany are turkish or european nationals , of which only one third has eu passports .
the rest come from countries that hope to join the eu , such as turkey , croatia , macedonia as well as russia and other countries . decades after the first " guest workers " arrived from turkey during the wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1960s , the turks are still germany 's largest foreign minority , followed by the italians , poles , serbs , greeks , croatians and russians .
nearly all of the 192 nations that are member states of the united nations are represented in germany , reflecting a growing diversity in the entire resident population , which numbers 82 million . most foreigners are long-time residents the majority of foreigners in germany are long time residents of the country .
some 72 percent or nearly five million foreigners have lived in germany for a minimum of eight years and therefore even meet the minimum residency requirements to apply for citizenship . about half of those long-time foreign residents have been in the country for more than twenty years , whereas twenty percent of all foreigners were born in germany .
the average age of foreign residents is 38 years old , a slight rise from 2007 , which suggests that since the 2000 nationality laws took effect , more foreigners born in germany are becoming citizens , according to the statistics office .
in 2008 , there were only 356,400 children under the age of 10 who were foreign nationals , compared to 521,300 in the same age group three years ago . df / tt / dpa / afp / destatis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 23.03.2009 changing dialects between the two koreas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korean is the official language of north and south korea north and south korea have differences that go beyond politics and economy .
even their languages are n't quite the same .
since the two nations were split more than sixty years ago , their dialects have gone in different directions .
and for thousands of north koreans refugees , what their south korean brethren speak these days , sounds a bit foreign . chae su jeong says that when she defected from north korea in 2001 , she was surprised to see how modern seoul was .
coming from one of north korea ’ s poorest areas , the 42 year old couldn ’ t believe how many cars there were and couldn ’ t figure out how bank atms worked .
she got over those things after a few months , but she says what really shocked her was when she encountered a language barrier with her south korean co-workers .
chae says she did n't realise how different north and south korean languages were until she started working for a recycling company .
back home in north korea , she says , they have only one word to describe all types of paper , but here there are many .
it really embarrassed her that she did n't know what her co-workers were talking about .
political manipulation the north korean language , like much of the nation itself , is stuck in a time warp .
it has retained a lot of words and expressions that south koreans no longer use .
or the meanings have changed .
some analysts say that political manipulation is another reason for the language divide .
kim seok hyang lectures at the ewha institute for unification studies in seoul and has written a book on the use of language in north korea .
she gives an example of one word whose meaning was changed to honour the north ’ s rulers .
“ sun-mul , in korean language , means present to your friend .
but now , in north korea , sun-mul is the reserved word by kim il sung and kim jong il , so only kim il sung and kim jong il are the only two who can give sun-mul to another person . ”
use of ' konglish ' another linguistic problem for north korean refugees in south korea is caused by the influx of english words .
the mix is known as konglish .
this is becoming more prevalent - especially in the field of modern technology .
it is difficult for someone to know how to send a fax or make a xerox if he or she has never heard the word or seen the devices used .
defector chae su jeong says it was tough to learn all these new words .
chae says she had no idea what the word “ camera ” meant .
in north korea , it 's called a sa-jin-gi .
she adds that since she started learning english , everyday life in south korea has become a little easier .
north korea not only keeps english words out of the language but has also done away with chinese characters , which are still learned in south korea .
for these reasons , north koreans believe they speak a superior form of the korean language .
many continue to think this even after they have defected to south korea .
" north korean defectors are arguing their way of using korean language is pure and clean way of protecting korean from outside dirty thing , " says kim seok hyang .
those dirty things are of course foreign words . jason strother 23/03/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

but german politicians are more concerned with the dispute 's political consequences . swiss defense minsiter ueli maurer has replaced the mercedes s430 he used to ride in , with a renault espace .
the symbolic move is meant to show his discontent with the ongoing tax-haven disagreement between switzerland and germany . " the tax dispute has annoyed and angered him so much that he has switched to another pool car , " maurer 's spokesman said sunday , march 22 . the quarrel began last week when german finance minister peer steinbrueck said the swiss were like indians running scared from a cavalry ready to enforce international banking laws .
in return , a swiss politician compared steinbrueck to a nazi . a domestic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a renault is edging out mercedes in switzerland herbert scheidt , the head of zurich-based vontobel banking group , accused steinbrueck of running roughshod over swiss interests . " as a german , i find the virulent and rough behavior shown by the finance minster of the last days and weeks to be particularly regrettable , " scheidt told the welt am sonntag newspaper , adding that the swiss view of tax law was something berlin has to accept for the time being . while swiss politicians decry what they see as foreign interference in their domestic affairs , germans have accused steinbrueck of tarnishing germany 's image abroad . " the completely inappropriate way the finance minster has expressed himself to switzerland in the legitimate fight against tax havens is inacceptable , " volker kauder , the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group leader , told the leipziger volkszeitung on monday . punishing german banks steinbrueck has said he would be willing to meet his swiss counterpart but justified his remarks saying he had learned to " formulate his remarks regarding tax havens in switzerland in an unambiguous way .

an oil-rich gulf investor , who also owns a premier english soccer club , plans to take a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler .
the move would make aabar investments the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder . an abu dhabi investor is paying 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 billion -rrb- to scoop up a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler , becoming the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder at a time the world auto industry is undergoing its worst crisis in decades .
the gulf-based aabar investments , which is a partially state-owned affiliate of international petroleum investment company -lrb- ipic -rrb- , is paying 20.27 euros a share for the offering , a slight discount from friday 's closing price of 21.55 euros .
daimler had increased its share capital by ten percent to allow aabar to purchase the new equity stake .
besides its main energy interests , aabar has diversified its investments in other sectors such as real estate , financial services and infrastructure projects .
investments are planned " we are delighted to welcome aabar as a new major shareholder that is supportive of our corporate strategy , " said daimler ceo dieter zetsche late on sunday .
zetsche said the deal would give the group extra flexibility to invest in new automotive technologies .

daimler 's second-largest shareholder is the state of kuwait , whose stake would be reduced to just under seven percent after aabar 's move .
the aabar investment is a boost for germany 's auto industry as opel , the german subsidiary of beleaguered general motors , is asking berlin for government help .
although daimler is not in the same dire straits as opel , group profits plunged last year when the stuttgart-based giant had to completely write off its losses in us automaker chrysler .
daimler had sold most of its chrysler stake in 2007 , but is struggling with a drop in worldwide demand for its premium cars and trucks .
the company 's net profits for last year plummeted by 65 percent to 1.41 billion euros .

but german politicians are more concerned with the dispute 's political consequences . swiss defense minsiter ueli maurer has replaced the mercedes s430 he used to ride in , with a renault espace .
the symbolic move is meant to show his discontent with the ongoing tax-haven disagreement between switzerland and germany . " the tax dispute has annoyed and angered him so much that he has switched to another pool car , " maurer 's spokesman said sunday , march 22 . the quarrel began last week when german finance minister peer steinbrueck said the swiss were like indians running scared from a cavalry ready to enforce international banking laws .
in return , a swiss politician compared steinbrueck to a nazi . a domestic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a renault is edging out mercedes in switzerland herbert scheidt , the head of zurich-based vontobel banking group , accused steinbrueck of running roughshod over swiss interests . " as a german , i find the virulent and rough behavior shown by the finance minster of the last days and weeks to be particularly regrettable , " scheidt told the welt am sonntag newspaper , adding that the swiss view of tax law was something berlin has to accept for the time being . while swiss politicians decry what they see as foreign interference in their domestic affairs , germans have accused steinbrueck of tarnishing germany 's image abroad . " the completely inappropriate way the finance minster has expressed himself to switzerland in the legitimate fight against tax havens is inacceptable , " volker kauder , the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group leader , told the leipziger volkszeitung on monday . punishing german banks steinbrueck has said he would be willing to meet his swiss counterpart but justified his remarks saying he had learned to " formulate his remarks regarding tax havens in switzerland in an unambiguous way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin may try to put an end to non-transparent banking deals part of the unambiguous action could be punishing german banks with subsidiaries in switzerland , according to a report in the german newsmagazine der spiegel . the office responsible for administrating germany 's financial sector bailout funds -lrb- bafin -rrb- reportedly requested information from banks about their operations in switzerland and liechtenstein , to ensure regulations dealing with the prevention of money laundering were being met . according to the magazine , the banks will be forced to end " non-transparent business relationships . " spiegel said a swiss subsidiary of deutsche bank administered accounts held by foundations in liechtenstein .
foundations in the alpine principality have been used by tax evaders , including former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel , to hide money from authorities . deutsche bank as well as other banks with swiss subsidiaries , including commerzbank and dresdner bank , did not comment on the spiegel report . the organization for economic cooperation and development has named liechtenstein , monaco and andorra as uncooperative tax havens . sms / jen / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier . " we are working for safe and attractive conditions for the transit of russian gas , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" there is no intention to exclude russia . " european confidence in ukraine took a hit in january , when a bitter argument between russia and ukraine over prices left europe without access to most russian gas for more than two weeks .
the two countries eventually came to an agreement , but tensions continue to run high . " we can not allow our citizens to experience fuel shortages in the depths of winter again , " said eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner . a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants better monitoring of gas supplies as part of the agreement announced in brussels on monday , the former soviet country laid out a plan to overhaul its gas transit system .
ukraine has agreed to reforms which will include setting up an independent company to oversee the multi-billion-euro project . ukraine 's 40-year-old natural gas system is in desperate need of an upgrade .
experts have estimated that ukraine needs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- over the next few years just to keep its system functioning properly . the european union has a keen interest in having ukraine 's system running smoothly as some 20 percent of the bloc 's natural gas supplies come from russia via ukraine . ukraine 's prime minister yulia tymoshenko told those attending the meeting in brussels that ukraine wants 5.5 billion euros to modernize the current system and also boost capacity . " today 's conference is extremely important for us because europe 's energy security requires an approach based on solidarity and agreement between the eu and ukraine , " tymoshenko said . both tymoshenko and her bitter political rival president viktor yushchenko attended the meeting in brussels and threw their support behind the bilateral declaration . europe hopeful , but cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has asked for foreign investment to upgrade its system analysts say that the pledge signed on monday could sound the death knell for the monopoly of ukrainian gas company naftogaz , which currently both manages the system and provides ukrainian consumers with gas . before aid and investment money begins flowing , ukraine will have to prove it is willing to make big changes , said philippe maystadt , head of the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- . the bank is willing to co-finance the modernization of ukraine 's gas system , but only if it is done in a " commercially sound and transparent way . " the eu currently has monitors in ukraine to check on the flow of russian gas through a key ukrainian pipeline , and the bloc has said it will increase surveillance if necessary to ensure that gas keeps flowing to europe . europe looking at other options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has hoped monitors can keep supplies flowing eu countries , in an effort to avoid being held hostage by future disputes between russia and ukraine , recently agreed to invest 200 million euros in the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas direct from the caspian sea to europe . germany 's deputy economics minister bernd pfaffenbach pointed out that europe 's demand for energy in the future will continue to grow and that it makes sense to " diversify the supply sources and the delivery networks . " german energy company rwe has thrown its support behind the project , said ceo stefan judisch . " with nabucco , german consumers will have more gas , and gas could also become cheaper because there will be more competition , " judisch said . details about how the project will be financed are on the agenda for an eu meeting in prague in may . th / tt / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an oil-rich gulf investor , who also owns a premier english soccer club , plans to take a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler .
the move would make aabar investments the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder . an abu dhabi investor is paying 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 billion -rrb- to scoop up a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler , becoming the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder at a time the world auto industry is undergoing its worst crisis in decades .
the gulf-based aabar investments , which is a partially state-owned affiliate of international petroleum investment company -lrb- ipic -rrb- , is paying 20.27 euros a share for the offering , a slight discount from friday 's closing price of 21.55 euros .
daimler had increased its share capital by ten percent to allow aabar to purchase the new equity stake .
besides its main energy interests , aabar has diversified its investments in other sectors such as real estate , financial services and infrastructure projects .
investments are planned " we are delighted to welcome aabar as a new major shareholder that is supportive of our corporate strategy , " said daimler ceo dieter zetsche late on sunday .
zetsche said the deal would give the group extra flexibility to invest in new automotive technologies .
for its part , aabar said it values german technological prowess , and that it would work with daimler on the development of environmentally friendly electric cars , research into new compound materials for the industry , and building a new training center in the emirates capital for nurturing engineering talent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petroleum rich gulf region invests in new energy markets .
the chairman of aabar 's parent company , ipic , is mansour bin zayed al nahyan , an abu dhabi sheikh and member of the royal family who owns the premier soccer club manchester city .
daimler , a pet of gulf investors this is not the first time that daimler , whose flagship brand is mercedes benz , has attracted investors from the gulf region .
daimler 's second-largest shareholder is the state of kuwait , whose stake would be reduced to just under seven percent after aabar 's move .
the aabar investment is a boost for germany 's auto industry as opel , the german subsidiary of beleaguered general motors , is asking berlin for government help .
although daimler is not in the same dire straits as opel , group profits plunged last year when the stuttgart-based giant had to completely write off its losses in us automaker chrysler .
daimler had sold most of its chrysler stake in 2007 , but is struggling with a drop in worldwide demand for its premium cars and trucks .
the company 's net profits for last year plummeted by 65 percent to 1.41 billion euros .
need shareholders ' approval in april most of daimler stock is traded publicly on the frankfurt stock exchange , unlike other german automakers such as bmw , volkswagen and porsche , which have huge family-owned stakes .
although the board has already approved the deal with aabar , shareholders would also have to give it the green light at daimler 's annual meeting on april 9 .

an oil-rich gulf investor , who also owns a premier english soccer club , plans to take a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler .
the move would make aabar investments the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder . an abu dhabi investor is paying 1.95 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.65 billion -rrb- to scoop up a 9.1 percent stake in germany 's daimler , becoming the luxury carmaker 's biggest shareholder at a time the world auto industry is undergoing its worst crisis in decades .
the gulf-based aabar investments , which is a partially state-owned affiliate of international petroleum investment company -lrb- ipic -rrb- , is paying 20.27 euros a share for the offering , a slight discount from friday 's closing price of 21.55 euros .
daimler had increased its share capital by ten percent to allow aabar to purchase the new equity stake .
besides its main energy interests , aabar has diversified its investments in other sectors such as real estate , financial services and infrastructure projects .
investments are planned " we are delighted to welcome aabar as a new major shareholder that is supportive of our corporate strategy , " said daimler ceo dieter zetsche late on sunday .
zetsche said the deal would give the group extra flexibility to invest in new automotive technologies .
for its part , aabar said it values german technological prowess , and that it would work with daimler on the development of environmentally friendly electric cars , research into new compound materials for the industry , and building a new training center in the emirates capital for nurturing engineering talent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petroleum rich gulf region invests in new energy markets .
the chairman of aabar 's parent company , ipic , is mansour bin zayed al nahyan , an abu dhabi sheikh and member of the royal family who owns the premier soccer club manchester city .
daimler , a pet of gulf investors this is not the first time that daimler , whose flagship brand is mercedes benz , has attracted investors from the gulf region .
daimler 's second-largest shareholder is the state of kuwait , whose stake would be reduced to just under seven percent after aabar 's move .
the aabar investment is a boost for germany 's auto industry as opel , the german subsidiary of beleaguered general motors , is asking berlin for government help .
although daimler is not in the same dire straits as opel , group profits plunged last year when the stuttgart-based giant had to completely write off its losses in us automaker chrysler .
daimler had sold most of its chrysler stake in 2007 , but is struggling with a drop in worldwide demand for its premium cars and trucks .
the company 's net profits for last year plummeted by 65 percent to 1.41 billion euros .
need shareholders ' approval in april most of daimler stock is traded publicly on the frankfurt stock exchange , unlike other german automakers such as bmw , volkswagen and porsche , which have huge family-owned stakes .
although the board has already approved the deal with aabar , shareholders would also have to give it the green light at daimler 's annual meeting on april 9 .
in early monday trading , daimler shares jumped more than eight percent on the news . df / jen / dpa / afp / ft send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier . " we are working for safe and attractive conditions for the transit of russian gas , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" there is no intention to exclude russia . " european confidence in ukraine took a hit in january , when a bitter argument between russia and ukraine over prices left europe without access to most russian gas for more than two weeks .
the two countries eventually came to an agreement , but tensions continue to run high . " we can not allow our citizens to experience fuel shortages in the depths of winter again , " said eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner . a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants better monitoring of gas supplies as part of the agreement announced in brussels on monday , the former soviet country laid out a plan to overhaul its gas transit system .
ukraine has agreed to reforms which will include setting up an independent company to oversee the multi-billion-euro project . ukraine 's 40-year-old natural gas system is in desperate need of an upgrade .
experts have estimated that ukraine needs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- over the next few years just to keep its system functioning properly . the european union has a keen interest in having ukraine 's system running smoothly as some 20 percent of the bloc 's natural gas supplies come from russia via ukraine . ukraine 's prime minister yulia tymoshenko told those attending the meeting in brussels that ukraine wants 5.5 billion euros to modernize the current system and also boost capacity . " today 's conference is extremely important for us because europe 's energy security requires an approach based on solidarity and agreement between the eu and ukraine , " tymoshenko said . both tymoshenko and her bitter political rival president viktor yushchenko attended the meeting in brussels and threw their support behind the bilateral declaration . europe hopeful , but cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has asked for foreign investment to upgrade its system analysts say that the pledge signed on monday could sound the death knell for the monopoly of ukrainian gas company naftogaz , which currently both manages the system and provides ukrainian consumers with gas . before aid and investment money begins flowing , ukraine will have to prove it is willing to make big changes , said philippe maystadt , head of the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- . the bank is willing to co-finance the modernization of ukraine 's gas system , but only if it is done in a " commercially sound and transparent way . " the eu currently has monitors in ukraine to check on the flow of russian gas through a key ukrainian pipeline , and the bloc has said it will increase surveillance if necessary to ensure that gas keeps flowing to europe . europe looking at other options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has hoped monitors can keep supplies flowing eu countries , in an effort to avoid being held hostage by future disputes between russia and ukraine , recently agreed to invest 200 million euros in the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas direct from the caspian sea to europe . germany 's deputy economics minister bernd pfaffenbach pointed out that europe 's demand for energy in the future will continue to grow and that it makes sense to " diversify the supply sources and the delivery networks . " german energy company rwe has thrown its support behind the project , said ceo stefan judisch . " with nabucco , german consumers will have more gas , and gas could also become cheaper because there will be more competition , " judisch said . details about how the project will be financed are on the agenda for an eu meeting in prague in may . th / tt / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but german politicians are more concerned with the dispute 's political consequences . swiss defense minsiter ueli maurer has replaced the mercedes s430 he used to ride in , with a renault espace .
the symbolic move is meant to show his discontent with the ongoing tax-haven disagreement between switzerland and germany . " the tax dispute has annoyed and angered him so much that he has switched to another pool car , " maurer 's spokesman said sunday , march 22 . the quarrel began last week when german finance minister peer steinbrueck said the swiss were like indians running scared from a cavalry ready to enforce international banking laws .
in return , a swiss politician compared steinbrueck to a nazi . a domestic decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a renault is edging out mercedes in switzerland herbert scheidt , the head of zurich-based vontobel banking group , accused steinbrueck of running roughshod over swiss interests . " as a german , i find the virulent and rough behavior shown by the finance minster of the last days and weeks to be particularly regrettable , " scheidt told the welt am sonntag newspaper , adding that the swiss view of tax law was something berlin has to accept for the time being . while swiss politicians decry what they see as foreign interference in their domestic affairs , germans have accused steinbrueck of tarnishing germany 's image abroad . " the completely inappropriate way the finance minster has expressed himself to switzerland in the legitimate fight against tax havens is inacceptable , " volker kauder , the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group leader , told the leipziger volkszeitung on monday . punishing german banks steinbrueck has said he would be willing to meet his swiss counterpart but justified his remarks saying he had learned to " formulate his remarks regarding tax havens in switzerland in an unambiguous way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin may try to put an end to non-transparent banking deals part of the unambiguous action could be punishing german banks with subsidiaries in switzerland , according to a report in the german newsmagazine der spiegel . the office responsible for administrating germany 's financial sector bailout funds -lrb- bafin -rrb- reportedly requested information from banks about their operations in switzerland and liechtenstein , to ensure regulations dealing with the prevention of money laundering were being met . according to the magazine , the banks will be forced to end " non-transparent business relationships . " spiegel said a swiss subsidiary of deutsche bank administered accounts held by foundations in liechtenstein .
foundations in the alpine principality have been used by tax evaders , including former deutsche post head klaus zumwinkel , to hide money from authorities . deutsche bank as well as other banks with swiss subsidiaries , including commerzbank and dresdner bank , did not comment on the spiegel report . the organization for economic cooperation and development has named liechtenstein , monaco and andorra as uncooperative tax havens . sms / jen / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it seems to me the document about which we are talking is , at a minimum , ill-considered and unprofessional because to discuss such issues without the basic supplier is simply not serious , " putin said in the black sea resort of sochi . russia 's former president also hinted that his country might have to re-think its relationship with the european union . " if the interests of russia are ignored then we will have to start re-examining the principles of relations with our partners , " he said . eu says russia not being shut out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine needs to update its gas supply infrastructure eu officials stressed that monday 's deal is not intended to reduce russia 's importance as the bloc 's number one gas supplier . " we are working for safe and attractive conditions for the transit of russian gas , " said eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" there is no intention to exclude russia . " european confidence in ukraine took a hit in january , when a bitter argument between russia and ukraine over prices left europe without access to most russian gas for more than two weeks .
the two countries eventually came to an agreement , but tensions continue to run high . " we can not allow our citizens to experience fuel shortages in the depths of winter again , " said eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner . a massive project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants better monitoring of gas supplies as part of the agreement announced in brussels on monday , the former soviet country laid out a plan to overhaul its gas transit system .
ukraine has agreed to reforms which will include setting up an independent company to oversee the multi-billion-euro project . ukraine 's 40-year-old natural gas system is in desperate need of an upgrade .
experts have estimated that ukraine needs 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- over the next few years just to keep its system functioning properly . the european union has a keen interest in having ukraine 's system running smoothly as some 20 percent of the bloc 's natural gas supplies come from russia via ukraine . ukraine 's prime minister yulia tymoshenko told those attending the meeting in brussels that ukraine wants 5.5 billion euros to modernize the current system and also boost capacity . " today 's conference is extremely important for us because europe 's energy security requires an approach based on solidarity and agreement between the eu and ukraine , " tymoshenko said . both tymoshenko and her bitter political rival president viktor yushchenko attended the meeting in brussels and threw their support behind the bilateral declaration . europe hopeful , but cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has asked for foreign investment to upgrade its system analysts say that the pledge signed on monday could sound the death knell for the monopoly of ukrainian gas company naftogaz , which currently both manages the system and provides ukrainian consumers with gas . before aid and investment money begins flowing , ukraine will have to prove it is willing to make big changes , said philippe maystadt , head of the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- . the bank is willing to co-finance the modernization of ukraine 's gas system , but only if it is done in a " commercially sound and transparent way . " the eu currently has monitors in ukraine to check on the flow of russian gas through a key ukrainian pipeline , and the bloc has said it will increase surveillance if necessary to ensure that gas keeps flowing to europe . europe looking at other options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has hoped monitors can keep supplies flowing eu countries , in an effort to avoid being held hostage by future disputes between russia and ukraine , recently agreed to invest 200 million euros in the " nabucco " pipeline project , which is meant to bypass both countries and bring gas direct from the caspian sea to europe . germany 's deputy economics minister bernd pfaffenbach pointed out that europe 's demand for energy in the future will continue to grow and that it makes sense to " diversify the supply sources and the delivery networks . " german energy company rwe has thrown its support behind the project , said ceo stefan judisch . " with nabucco , german consumers will have more gas , and gas could also become cheaper because there will be more competition , " judisch said . details about how the project will be financed are on the agenda for an eu meeting in prague in may . th / tt / dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of turkish citizens living in germany , however , declined by 25,200 to 1.7 million by year-end in 2008 , due mainly to the number of turks who were granted german citizenship during the course of the entire year .
ethnic turks residing in germany must normally choose between turkish or german citizenship .
even though nationality laws based mainly on descent were eased in 2000 , it is not uncommon for those born in germany to foreigners to assume their parents ' nationality instead . influx from the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law made it easier for those born in germany to foreign parents to become citizens in contrast to the decline in numbers of turkish nationals , the number of foreigners from eu member states rose in the same 12-month period .
the largest numbers of eu foreigners came from countries that had joined the 27-nation bloc since its expansion eastwards in 2004 . the number of poles who settled in germany went up by some 9,000 in 2008 compared to the previous year .
however the biggest percentage gains came from rumania and bulgaria , which were admitted to the european union in 2007 .
the number of rumanian nationals went up by 9,700 in 2008 , up 12 percent from the previous year , while the number of bulgarian citizens rose to 7,200 , up 15 percent from 2007 .
eu passports not very common bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign " guest workers " helped fuel the german economic boom about 80 percent of all foreigners living in germany are turkish or european nationals , of which only one third has eu passports .
the rest come from countries that hope to join the eu , such as turkey , croatia , macedonia as well as russia and other countries . decades after the first " guest workers " arrived from turkey during the wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1960s , the turks are still germany 's largest foreign minority , followed by the italians , poles , serbs , greeks , croatians and russians .
nearly all of the 192 nations that are member states of the united nations are represented in germany , reflecting a growing diversity in the entire resident population , which numbers 82 million . most foreigners are long-time residents the majority of foreigners in germany are long time residents of the country .
some 72 percent or nearly five million foreigners have lived in germany for a minimum of eight years and therefore even meet the minimum residency requirements to apply for citizenship . about half of those long-time foreign residents have been in the country for more than twenty years , whereas twenty percent of all foreigners were born in germany .
the average age of foreign residents is 38 years old , a slight rise from 2007 , which suggests that since the 2000 nationality laws took effect , more foreigners born in germany are becoming citizens , according to the statistics office .
in 2008 , there were only 356,400 children under the age of 10 who were foreign nationals , compared to 521,300 in the same age group three years ago . df / tt / dpa / afp / destatis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

have your say the number of " suicidal " children calling a welsh helpline has risen four-fold in the past five years , a charity says .
nspcc cymru / wales reported an average of nearly 10 such calls a week to its childline bases in wales last year , amounting to a total of more than 500 .
abuse , neglect , family problems or mental health issues were among the reasons cited for calls .
the nspcc 's simon jones said : " we treat every call as extremely serious " .
some 50 % of the callers gave their age , and half were aged 12-15 , the charity reported .
some said they had already attempted suicide , while others made attempts while on the phone to a counsellor . "
every child deserves a happy childhood and the chance to grow and experience a full life " simon jones , nspcc the charity revealed that four out of five calls to bases in wales about suicide were from girls , but calls from boys were rising faster and were now higher than five years ago .
nspcc cymru / wales issued transcripts of two calls from " suicidal " children .
a 10-year-old girl told a childline counsellor : " i hate my life now dad 's gone because i get blamed for everything and mum is in the pub every day .
" we never have any money because of her drinking and i 've got no friends now .
i just want to die " .
' scared ' another caller , a 13-year-old boy said : " i feel like killing myself .
my mum and dad beat me and i 'm getting bullied at school .
" i do n't have anyone else to turn to except childline .
no one else would be able to help me ; i 'm scared of telling anyone . "
mr jones , nspcc policy and public affairs manager for wales , commented : " it is heartbreaking to listen to children talk of wanting to consider suicide .
for a suicidal child , childline can literally be a lifeline . "
i feel like killing myself .
my mum and dad beat me and i 'm getting bullied at school " childline caller , aged 13 " suicidal children tell us they feel utterly lonely and helpless and , apart from childline , nobody seems to care whether they live or die .
" our counsellors are trained to deal with suicide calls so they can assess the danger and how best to help .
" for some children , saying they want to take their own lives themselves is a cry for help , while others see it as the only way to escape their problems .
" while many callers will not actually attempt suicide we treat every call as extremely serious . "
mr jones explained that the children were feeling suicidal for complex and different reasons , but often reported a history of abuse , neglect , family problems or mental health issues .
others had been driven to the brink by bullying , the death of someone close or exam stress , he said .
' struggled with emotions ' he said : " we need to remember that behind every suicide is a child or young person who has struggled with emotions or situations in their lives .
" the situation within the bridgend area brought into focus the issue of youth suicide and we need to learn whatever we can from those tragedies to improve prevention and protection of children and young people across wales .
" children can hide their distress so effectively that parents may have no idea their child is suicidal .
" we strongly urge any child who feels suicidal to call childline .
or they could speak to a trusted adult such as their teacher or doctor .
" every child deserves a happy childhood and the chance to grow and experience a full life .
it is vital that children get the support they need . "
the nspcc has called for teachers and doctors to be trained to identify suicide distress signs before children reach crisis point , and wants therapy to be made available for all children who have suffered abuse .
since childline joined with the nspcc in 2006 , the helpline has been expanded and said it answers more calls from children and young people than ever before .
even so , childline said it was still unable to answer one in three calls .
in response , the nspcc has called on the public to donate to its child 's voice appeal , saying it needs to raise an extra £ 50m over the next three years , in addition to £ 30m already pledged by the uk government , so that childline can try to answer every call for help .

" the situation within the bridgend area brought into focus the issue of youth suicide and we need to learn whatever we can from those tragedies to improve prevention and protection of children and young people across wales .
" children can hide their distress so effectively that parents may have no idea their child is suicidal .
" we strongly urge any child who feels suicidal to call childline .
or they could speak to a trusted adult such as their teacher or doctor .
" every child deserves a happy childhood and the chance to grow and experience a full life .
it is vital that children get the support they need . "
the nspcc has called for teachers and doctors to be trained to identify suicide distress signs before children reach crisis point , and wants therapy to be made available for all children who have suffered abuse .
since childline joined with the nspcc in 2006 , the helpline has been expanded and said it answers more calls from children and young people than ever before .
even so , childline said it was still unable to answer one in three calls .
in response , the nspcc has called on the public to donate to its child 's voice appeal , saying it needs to raise an extra £ 50m over the next three years , in addition to £ 30m already pledged by the uk government , so that childline can try to answer every call for help .

have your say the number of " suicidal " children calling a welsh helpline has risen four-fold in the past five years , a charity says .
nspcc cymru / wales reported an average of nearly 10 such calls a week to its childline bases in wales last year , amounting to a total of more than 500 .
abuse , neglect , family problems or mental health issues were among the reasons cited for calls .
the nspcc 's simon jones said : " we treat every call as extremely serious " .
some 50 % of the callers gave their age , and half were aged 12-15 , the charity reported .
some said they had already attempted suicide , while others made attempts while on the phone to a counsellor .
every child deserves a happy childhood and the chance to grow and experience a full life simon jones , nspcc the charity revealed that four out of five calls to bases in wales about suicide were from girls , but calls from boys were rising faster and were now higher than five years ago .
nspcc cymru / wales issued transcripts of two calls from " suicidal " children .
a 10-year-old girl told a childline counsellor : " i hate my life now dad 's gone because i get blamed for everything and mum is in the pub every day .
" we never have any money because of her drinking and i 've got no friends now .
i just want to die " .
' scared ' another caller , a 13-year-old boy said : " i feel like killing myself .
my mum and dad beat me and i 'm getting bullied at school .
" i do n't have anyone else to turn to except childline .
no one else would be able to help me ; i 'm scared of telling anyone . "
mr jones , nspcc policy and public affairs manager for wales , commented : " it is heartbreaking to listen to children talk of wanting to consider suicide .
for a suicidal child , childline can literally be a lifeline .
i feel like killing myself .
my mum and dad beat me and i 'm getting bullied at school childline caller , aged 13 " suicidal children tell us they feel utterly lonely and helpless and , apart from childline , nobody seems to care whether they live or die .
" our counsellors are trained to deal with suicide calls so they can assess the danger and how best to help .
" for some children , saying they want to take their own lives themselves is a cry for help , while others see it as the only way to escape their problems .
" while many callers will not actually attempt suicide we treat every call as extremely serious . "
mr jones explained that the children were feeling suicidal for complex and different reasons , but often reported a history of abuse , neglect , family problems or mental health issues .
others had been driven to the brink by bullying , the death of someone close or exam stress , he said .
' struggled with emotions ' he said : " we need to remember that behind every suicide is a child or young person who has struggled with emotions or situations in their lives .
" the situation within the bridgend area brought into focus the issue of youth suicide and we need to learn whatever we can from those tragedies to improve prevention and protection of children and young people across wales .
" children can hide their distress so effectively that parents may have no idea their child is suicidal .
" we strongly urge any child who feels suicidal to call childline .
or they could speak to a trusted adult such as their teacher or doctor .
" every child deserves a happy childhood and the chance to grow and experience a full life .
it is vital that children get the support they need . "
the nspcc has called for teachers and doctors to be trained to identify suicide distress signs before children reach crisis point , and wants therapy to be made available for all children who have suffered abuse .
since childline joined with the nspcc in 2006 , the helpline has been expanded and said it answers more calls from children and young people than ever before .
even so , childline said it was still unable to answer one in three calls .
in response , the nspcc has called on the public to donate to its child 's voice appeal , saying it needs to raise an extra £ 50m over the next three years , in addition to £ 30m already pledged by the uk government , so that childline can try to answer every call for help .

the british holiday and home parks association -lrb- bh and hpa -rrb- says the contribution the parks make to the region is " often overlooked " .
wales tourism week 2009 , running until 29 march , aims to promote the work of 7,000 tourism businesses in wales .
a tourism summit in december heard the strength of the euro and the credit crunch could boost welsh tourism .
around 104,000 people are employed in the wales ' tourism industry in full and part time jobs , with the sector worth around £ 1.5bn to the welsh economy .
the assembly government has invested £ 2.2m investment in tourism marketing , distributing around two million leaflets between january and march to previous visitors to wales .
in addition to newspaper advertising , a 40-second broadcast starring comedian and radio presenter rhod gilbert has been shown on tv and , for the first time , in cinemas .
' holiday choices ' the bh and hpa said the mid wales area appealed to caravan owners because it offered " such a good package and people here are so friendly " .
julia warren-kyle , who runs a holiday park near machynlleth , said : " with all the doom and gloom about the economy , people are looking to escape to the countryside from the stress of busy lives for some well earned relaxation time .
" it 's a much more relaxing option than the trials of busy airports and rising foreign exchange costs . "
at a welsh assembly government tourism summit in caernarfon , gwynedd , in december , heritage minister alun ffred jones said economic uncertainty was likely to make people " think harder and differently about their holidays choices " .
he said people would want " real value and authentic quality , not over-indulgence and ostentation " .
