it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink . a study carried out across the eu on behalf of the french political innovation foundation shows that 18 percent of those surveyed said they were ' not at all interested ' in the june poll , whilst 35 percent said they were ' rather not interested ' .
the same number said they were ' rather interested ' but only a meager 11 percent said they were ' very interested ' . the data coming in on voter apathy across the european union is turning unspoken but common knowledge into hard facts : the eu elections hold no interest for a huge number of the bloc 's citizens . what is less clear are the reasons why .
attempts have been made to connect the expected dramatically low turn-out with frustration over the incompetence of ministers , the mounting corruption scandals and the perceived idleness that voters associate with the overblown bureaucracy many believe the eu has become . but to equate the apparent refusal of so many europeans to head to the polls with an act of protest assumes that many people actually know or care what happens in brussels and strasbourg .
election experts believe it 's a lot simpler than that . " the european parliament is very important and the people who work there have an important role , but no-one has bothered to explain this to the voters , " professor mark franklin , chair of the european election studies steering group , told deutsche welle .
" it 's not clear what the european parliament does , it 's certainly not clear as to what difference it makes and it regularly throws up electoral lists full of unrecognizable names and faces .
it all adds up to the opinion that there 's no point to any of it . " boring election with no pay-off dr. hermann schmitt , project director at the mannheim center for european social research , told deutsche welle that he thought the lack of a tangible end product was turning voters off . " we know that people are disinterested , even to the degree that they don ’ t even know what 's going on , " he said .
" the main reason for this is that the european elections are seen to be quite unimportant .
this is because , in the european parliament election , the thing that characterizes a normal election is not going to happen – that is , a government is not going to be formed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are not immune from election lethargy " it 's not that people are staying away from these elections because they are critical of the european union and its political process ; it 's just that these elections are so boring and one does n't know why one should participate because not much is going to happen as a result of it , " he added . european parliamentary election turnout has fallen steadily from 66 percent in 1979 to just over 45 percent in 2004 , and in most member states is amongst the lowest for any form of poll . professor franklin is not surprised at all by the predicted voting figures .
he is , if anything , surprised that so many are saying that they intend to take part in this election . " the most amazing thing is that anyone votes at all , " he said .
" why would anyone vote in an election where they have no idea what 's at stake , what the issues are and what , if any , difference the election will have on their lives ?
that ’ s the case with all european elections . " three voting groups make up the numbers franklin believes that those who will vote will come from three groups which can always be relied upon to take part in elections .
these groups vote out of loyalty , habit or just because they want a change of pace . bildunterschrift : the greens traditionally benefit from expressive votes " we have the party loyalists who react to calls from their leaders to vote and save their party humiliation ; then there are those who vote out of habit , who generally believe that voting is a good thing and that they should exercise that right to vote , and then there are the expressive voters who tend to vote for parties , such as the greens , for whom they would n't normally vote in national elections , " he said . " these expressive votes usually come about because the voters know that it doesn ’ t matter who they vote for , because they think it wo n't matter anyway , it just gives them a chance to support someone different . " while eurocrats may be worried about keeping their jobs , a more serious concern is that the expected low turn-out could have unpleasant consequences for the make-up of the future parliament and the political spectrum in europe . lower turn-out plays into extremist hands the lower the turnout , the easier it will be for more radical parties to do well .
as in the 1930s , rising extremism is seen as a key potential risk from the financial crisis and resulting rise in unemployment and hardship . that could potentially see a rise both for far-left parties and right-wingers , including those angry at rising immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's extremist bnp could benefit from voter apathy anti-foreigner rhetoric , and in some cases violence , have increased in several countries in recent months .
analysts are watching the potential rise of the far-right in hungary and the nationalist british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , amongst others . " a low turn-out would certainly have implications in terms of niche or radical fringe parties , " professor franklin said .
" this is where the expressive voters come in .
they may make a choice to vote for a far-right or far-left party because of the reasons i gave before , that they believe that it wo n't make a difference .
they wouldn ’ t do this in national elections because it may have an impact , but in europe – who cares ? " what could happen , though , is that these extremist parties , for example an anti-eu party , may take seats away from others and then make the passing of legislation almost impossible , freezing the political process , " he added . franklin also believes that politics on a national level may suffer across europe as a result . eu elections could color the national voting experience " this european election experience may be the first time that around 50 percent of voters in the eu vote for the first time , " he said .
" if this is their first experience of an electoral vote , imagine what that can do to their opinion of the democratic process !
the next time there 's a national vote , the domestic parties may say , ' those eu elections were n't that important but these ones are ' – but by then an opinion is already starting to form that all elections are pointless , especially among young voters .
this is one of the reasons why national turn-outs are also on the wane across europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign fight involving barroso might excite voters both franklin and schmitt say that a change in the process where electable figureheads are campaigning for office – be it the president of the commission or a future european president – could help encourage people to vote in european elections . " if the parliament would elect the president of the commission and two or three competing candidates would run in these elections , things would be different and turn-out would increase , " schmitt said .
" elections are about horse races , elections are about who is going to govern , elections are about people and faces and whether you like them or you do n't . " a real race - but who would want to run ? " to make the european elections more attractive , the process could include a number of presidential candidates who are running against each other , " franklin said .
" then there will be other politicians who will stand and say ' i support such and such because of this and that ' .
we might then get a debate about what these people intend to do .
it will be a real election with electable faces and personalities . " however , franklin believes that turning european elections into a sexy presidential race will probably not happen any time soon . " someone once said that electing a european president would relegate people , like the president of france , into a role no more important than the governor of texas , " he said .

a 33-year-old german geophysicist , gerst will prepare to travel to space in september . deutsche welle : congratulations on being selected as one of the european space agency 's astronauts .
what was your first reaction when you got the news ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst said he is not afraid of being shot into space alexander gerst : it was the greatest feeling i could imagine at that time .
it was obviously a great dream of mine that i 'd had for most of my life that was fulfilled at that moment .
it 's hard to describe . you are basically living a dream ? yes , i was .
for me it is a long-standing dream to explore our planet and the space around it .
i was always a very curious person .
as a child i turned over every stone and looked behind every tree and i liked to explore .
for me now , after becoming a scientist , which allows me to do those things down here on earth , this new job offers me the chance to do the same in space which is the ultimate way for me to do science and exploration . thousands of people sent in applications to become one of europe 's astronauts .
how difficult was the selection process ? some of the tests were , obviously , quite tough - even for a successful candidate , they were n't easy at all .
i never went out of a test saying , " i 've got this one in the bag . "
i always came out with mixed feelings .
i said , " well , i did n't do so bad , but i also was n't really good at it . "
in the end it worked out , but it 's hard to tell .
some of the tests felt quite easy and natural and some others were very tough . what do you think it was that singled you out from the thousands of others during the grueling , year-long process for the role of european astronaut ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of training are necessary before stepping out into space i 'm actually not completely sure .
i think it might be a little of everything .
certainly there was some luck involved .
i considered myself lucky that my body was good enough to pass the medical test , which i 'm not fully responsible for . a very important component is fascination - fascination for the space program , fascination for the job .
that fascination leads to persistence to follow through with all the tests and all the preparations and to not give up on the way . another very important criterion is working in teams .
i 've shown through experiences i 've had in antarctica that i can perform in a team , and many others have done so as well , and i think that 's a very important criterion for the european space agency . you are a geophysicist , four of the other people chosen are pilots and the fifth works with guidance systems .
what role do you think your position as a scientist plays ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst conducted some of his research in antarctica every good team has to be a diverse one .
the charter of european astronauts says " unity through diversity , " and that 's the motto of all of europe in my opinion .
therefore , i think the european space agency did well by choosing a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences - only then can everyone contribute their experience to the bigger team experience . are you worried about what the future now holds for you ? i would n't call it worried , but it 's certainly a challenge .
i 've got a lot of press attention , but i do n't consider myself someone who has done a lot .
the european space agency puts a huge amount of trust in me and i do n't want to disappoint .
it 's a challenge and i 'm aware that i would like to perform as people expect . does the prospect of being strapped into a rocket and blasted into space frighten you ? no , not at all .
i 'm fascinated by that prospect . i do n't think fear is a helpful emotion in that respect .
i ca n't speak as an astronaut , of course , since i have n't flown yet , but as a scientist who has worked on active volcanoes i know that fear makes us irrational , which can sometimes be dangerous .
that is not a helpful feeling , but what is very important , at the same time , is to have respect for the risks involved - to minimize them and be aware of them .
so respect , yes , but fear , no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moon is a still a far-off goal for the new batch of future astronauts training for future missions to the international space station begins in september , and there is also a chance you could go to the moon in collaboration with nasa and other space agencies .
what will you , personally , be looking forward to ? the moon program is quite far away , so i ca n't put myself in any role there because it 's certainly not clear who is going to be on that mission .
i would personally love to be there .
i know that the moon is full of treasures for us . i would rather concentrate now on closer things , like my training and , after that , flights to the international space station . there is a lot of science to be done there that is so important for us down here on earth .
in economic and scientific ways there is very important research to be done up there and that is what i would like to concentrate on most . interview : rajiv sharma -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink . a study carried out across the eu on behalf of the french political innovation foundation shows that 18 percent of those surveyed said they were ' not at all interested ' in the june poll , whilst 35 percent said they were ' rather not interested ' .
the same number said they were ' rather interested ' but only a meager 11 percent said they were ' very interested ' . the data coming in on voter apathy across the european union is turning unspoken but common knowledge into hard facts : the eu elections hold no interest for a huge number of the bloc 's citizens . what is less clear are the reasons why .
attempts have been made to connect the expected dramatically low turn-out with frustration over the incompetence of ministers , the mounting corruption scandals and the perceived idleness that voters associate with the overblown bureaucracy many believe the eu has become . but to equate the apparent refusal of so many europeans to head to the polls with an act of protest assumes that many people actually know or care what happens in brussels and strasbourg .
election experts believe it 's a lot simpler than that . " the european parliament is very important and the people who work there have an important role , but no-one has bothered to explain this to the voters , " professor mark franklin , chair of the european election studies steering group , told deutsche welle .

he is , if anything , surprised that so many are saying that they intend to take part in this election . " the most amazing thing is that anyone votes at all , " he said .
" why would anyone vote in an election where they have no idea what 's at stake , what the issues are and what , if any , difference the election will have on their lives ?
that ’ s the case with all european elections . " three voting groups make up the numbers franklin believes that those who will vote will come from three groups which can always be relied upon to take part in elections .
these groups vote out of loyalty , habit or just because they want a change of pace . bildunterschrift : the greens traditionally benefit from expressive votes " we have the party loyalists who react to calls from their leaders to vote and save their party humiliation ; then there are those who vote out of habit , who generally believe that voting is a good thing and that they should exercise that right to vote , and then there are the expressive voters who tend to vote for parties , such as the greens , for whom they would n't normally vote in national elections , " he said . " these expressive votes usually come about because the voters know that it doesn ’ t matter who they vote for , because they think it wo n't matter anyway , it just gives them a chance to support someone different . " while eurocrats may be worried about keeping their jobs , a more serious concern is that the expected low turn-out could have unpleasant consequences for the make-up of the future parliament and the political spectrum in europe . lower turn-out plays into extremist hands the lower the turnout , the easier it will be for more radical parties to do well .
as in the 1930s , rising extremism is seen as a key potential risk from the financial crisis and resulting rise in unemployment and hardship . that could potentially see a rise both for far-left parties and right-wingers , including those angry at rising immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's extremist bnp could benefit from voter apathy anti-foreigner rhetoric , and in some cases violence , have increased in several countries in recent months .
analysts are watching the potential rise of the far-right in hungary and the nationalist british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , amongst others . " a low turn-out would certainly have implications in terms of niche or radical fringe parties , " professor franklin said .
" this is where the expressive voters come in .
they may make a choice to vote for a far-right or far-left party because of the reasons i gave before , that they believe that it wo n't make a difference .
they wouldn ’ t do this in national elections because it may have an impact , but in europe – who cares ? " what could happen , though , is that these extremist parties , for example an anti-eu party , may take seats away from others and then make the passing of legislation almost impossible , freezing the political process , " he added . franklin also believes that politics on a national level may suffer across europe as a result . eu elections could color the national voting experience " this european election experience may be the first time that around 50 percent of voters in the eu vote for the first time , " he said .
" if this is their first experience of an electoral vote , imagine what that can do to their opinion of the democratic process !
the next time there 's a national vote , the domestic parties may say , ' those eu elections were n't that important but these ones are ' – but by then an opinion is already starting to form that all elections are pointless , especially among young voters .
this is one of the reasons why national turn-outs are also on the wane across europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign fight involving barroso might excite voters both franklin and schmitt say that a change in the process where electable figureheads are campaigning for office – be it the president of the commission or a future european president – could help encourage people to vote in european elections . " if the parliament would elect the president of the commission and two or three competing candidates would run in these elections , things would be different and turn-out would increase , " schmitt said .
" elections are about horse races , elections are about who is going to govern , elections are about people and faces and whether you like them or you do n't . " a real race - but who would want to run ?

it will be a real election with electable faces and personalities .

it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink . a study carried out across the eu on behalf of the french political innovation foundation shows that 18 percent of those surveyed said they were ' not at all interested ' in the june poll , whilst 35 percent said they were ' rather not interested ' .
the same number said they were ' rather interested ' but only a meager 11 percent said they were ' very interested ' . the data coming in on voter apathy across the european union is turning unspoken but common knowledge into hard facts : the eu elections hold no interest for a huge number of the bloc 's citizens . what is less clear are the reasons why .
attempts have been made to connect the expected dramatically low turn-out with frustration over the incompetence of ministers , the mounting corruption scandals and the perceived idleness that voters associate with the overblown bureaucracy many believe the eu has become . but to equate the apparent refusal of so many europeans to head to the polls with an act of protest assumes that many people actually know or care what happens in brussels and strasbourg .
election experts believe it 's a lot simpler than that .

german business confidence rose in may for the second time in a row .
but observers say that the increase was less than forecast , and that the recession is far from over in germany . the munich-based ifo research institute said its closely-watched business-confidence index climbed to 84.2 points from 83.7 points in april .
this was the second increase in a row for the poll of 7,000 business leaders . but a reuters poll showed respondents had expected the index to increase to 85 points , and so reaction to the news was mixed .
mixed signal economists take the ifo reading as a serious measure of germany 's economic outlook .
some read the poll as a sign of a rosy future .
analyst joerg kraemer from commerzbank told reuters the measure was a " further clear signal that the plunging german economy is a thing of the past .
the recession is losing speed , and could be over by the autumn . "
' anemic ' improvement still , he warned that the coming improvements should n't be overestimated .
any improvements after that will be " anemic . "
other analysts saw the data in a less positive light .

ministers meeting in brussels on monday also adopted a set of common standards and sanctions against employers who hire illegal foreign immigrants .
these include making it mandatory for businesses to ensure that non-eu workers hold a valid residence permit and that a copy of such permits be kept on record should inspectors demand to see it .
eu-wide penalties would consist of fines , which would increase according to the number of illegally employed foreigners , and the possible exclusion of guilty businesses from accessing public funds or taking part in public tenders .
new rules designed to end abuses on the other hand , signing up to the blue card scheme would give foreign workers limited social welfare rights and benefits , and allow them to bring in their families while they work in an eu country .
the new rules are designed to end abuses by unscrupulous employers who hire illegal immigrants and then pay them sub-standard wages under poor working conditions .
the european commission 's far more ambitious initial proposal was watered down significantly by national governments , which insisted that it should be up to them to decide how many migrants should enter their countries and what qualifications eligible workers should have .
three eu members - britain , ireland and denmark - are not participating in the blue card program , preferring instead to set their own guidelines. gb / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a 33-year-old german geophysicist , gerst will prepare to travel to space in september . deutsche welle : congratulations on being selected as one of the european space agency 's astronauts .
what was your first reaction when you got the news ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst said he is not afraid of being shot into space alexander gerst : it was the greatest feeling i could imagine at that time .
it was obviously a great dream of mine that i 'd had for most of my life that was fulfilled at that moment .
it 's hard to describe . you are basically living a dream ? yes , i was .
for me it is a long-standing dream to explore our planet and the space around it .
i was always a very curious person .
as a child i turned over every stone and looked behind every tree and i liked to explore .
for me now , after becoming a scientist , which allows me to do those things down here on earth , this new job offers me the chance to do the same in space which is the ultimate way for me to do science and exploration . thousands of people sent in applications to become one of europe 's astronauts .
how difficult was the selection process ? some of the tests were , obviously , quite tough - even for a successful candidate , they were n't easy at all .
i never went out of a test saying , " i 've got this one in the bag . "
i always came out with mixed feelings .
i said , " well , i did n't do so bad , but i also was n't really good at it . "
in the end it worked out , but it 's hard to tell .
some of the tests felt quite easy and natural and some others were very tough . what do you think it was that singled you out from the thousands of others during the grueling , year-long process for the role of european astronaut ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of training are necessary before stepping out into space i 'm actually not completely sure .
i think it might be a little of everything .
certainly there was some luck involved .
i considered myself lucky that my body was good enough to pass the medical test , which i 'm not fully responsible for . a very important component is fascination - fascination for the space program , fascination for the job .
that fascination leads to persistence to follow through with all the tests and all the preparations and to not give up on the way . another very important criterion is working in teams .
i 've shown through experiences i 've had in antarctica that i can perform in a team , and many others have done so as well , and i think that 's a very important criterion for the european space agency . you are a geophysicist , four of the other people chosen are pilots and the fifth works with guidance systems .
what role do you think your position as a scientist plays ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst conducted some of his research in antarctica every good team has to be a diverse one .
the charter of european astronauts says " unity through diversity , " and that 's the motto of all of europe in my opinion .
therefore , i think the european space agency did well by choosing a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences - only then can everyone contribute their experience to the bigger team experience . are you worried about what the future now holds for you ? i would n't call it worried , but it 's certainly a challenge .
i 've got a lot of press attention , but i do n't consider myself someone who has done a lot .
the european space agency puts a huge amount of trust in me and i do n't want to disappoint .
it 's a challenge and i 'm aware that i would like to perform as people expect . does the prospect of being strapped into a rocket and blasted into space frighten you ? no , not at all .
i 'm fascinated by that prospect . i do n't think fear is a helpful emotion in that respect .
i ca n't speak as an astronaut , of course , since i have n't flown yet , but as a scientist who has worked on active volcanoes i know that fear makes us irrational , which can sometimes be dangerous .
that is not a helpful feeling , but what is very important , at the same time , is to have respect for the risks involved - to minimize them and be aware of them .
so respect , yes , but fear , no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moon is a still a far-off goal for the new batch of future astronauts training for future missions to the international space station begins in september , and there is also a chance you could go to the moon in collaboration with nasa and other space agencies .
what will you , personally , be looking forward to ? the moon program is quite far away , so i ca n't put myself in any role there because it 's certainly not clear who is going to be on that mission .
i would personally love to be there .
i know that the moon is full of treasures for us . i would rather concentrate now on closer things , like my training and , after that , flights to the international space station . there is a lot of science to be done there that is so important for us down here on earth .
in economic and scientific ways there is very important research to be done up there and that is what i would like to concentrate on most . interview : rajiv sharma -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ministers meeting in brussels on monday also adopted a set of common standards and sanctions against employers who hire illegal foreign immigrants .
these include making it mandatory for businesses to ensure that non-eu workers hold a valid residence permit and that a copy of such permits be kept on record should inspectors demand to see it .
eu-wide penalties would consist of fines , which would increase according to the number of illegally employed foreigners , and the possible exclusion of guilty businesses from accessing public funds or taking part in public tenders .
new rules designed to end abuses on the other hand , signing up to the blue card scheme would give foreign workers limited social welfare rights and benefits , and allow them to bring in their families while they work in an eu country .
the new rules are designed to end abuses by unscrupulous employers who hire illegal immigrants and then pay them sub-standard wages under poor working conditions .
the european commission 's far more ambitious initial proposal was watered down significantly by national governments , which insisted that it should be up to them to decide how many migrants should enter their countries and what qualifications eligible workers should have .
three eu members - britain , ireland and denmark - are not participating in the blue card program , preferring instead to set their own guidelines. gb / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a 33-year-old german geophysicist , gerst will prepare to travel to space in september . deutsche welle : congratulations on being selected as one of the european space agency 's astronauts .
what was your first reaction when you got the news ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst said he is not afraid of being shot into space alexander gerst : it was the greatest feeling i could imagine at that time .
it was obviously a great dream of mine that i 'd had for most of my life that was fulfilled at that moment .
it 's hard to describe . you are basically living a dream ? yes , i was .
for me it is a long-standing dream to explore our planet and the space around it .
i was always a very curious person .
as a child i turned over every stone and looked behind every tree and i liked to explore .
for me now , after becoming a scientist , which allows me to do those things down here on earth , this new job offers me the chance to do the same in space which is the ultimate way for me to do science and exploration . thousands of people sent in applications to become one of europe 's astronauts .
how difficult was the selection process ? some of the tests were , obviously , quite tough - even for a successful candidate , they were n't easy at all .
i never went out of a test saying , " i 've got this one in the bag . "
i always came out with mixed feelings .
i said , " well , i did n't do so bad , but i also was n't really good at it . "
in the end it worked out , but it 's hard to tell .
some of the tests felt quite easy and natural and some others were very tough . what do you think it was that singled you out from the thousands of others during the grueling , year-long process for the role of european astronaut ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of training are necessary before stepping out into space i 'm actually not completely sure .
i think it might be a little of everything .
certainly there was some luck involved .
i considered myself lucky that my body was good enough to pass the medical test , which i 'm not fully responsible for . a very important component is fascination - fascination for the space program , fascination for the job .
that fascination leads to persistence to follow through with all the tests and all the preparations and to not give up on the way . another very important criterion is working in teams .
i 've shown through experiences i 've had in antarctica that i can perform in a team , and many others have done so as well , and i think that 's a very important criterion for the european space agency . you are a geophysicist , four of the other people chosen are pilots and the fifth works with guidance systems .
what role do you think your position as a scientist plays ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst conducted some of his research in antarctica every good team has to be a diverse one .
the charter of european astronauts says " unity through diversity , " and that 's the motto of all of europe in my opinion .
therefore , i think the european space agency did well by choosing a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences - only then can everyone contribute their experience to the bigger team experience . are you worried about what the future now holds for you ? i would n't call it worried , but it 's certainly a challenge .
i 've got a lot of press attention , but i do n't consider myself someone who has done a lot .
the european space agency puts a huge amount of trust in me and i do n't want to disappoint .
it 's a challenge and i 'm aware that i would like to perform as people expect . does the prospect of being strapped into a rocket and blasted into space frighten you ? no , not at all .
i 'm fascinated by that prospect . i do n't think fear is a helpful emotion in that respect .
i ca n't speak as an astronaut , of course , since i have n't flown yet , but as a scientist who has worked on active volcanoes i know that fear makes us irrational , which can sometimes be dangerous .
that is not a helpful feeling , but what is very important , at the same time , is to have respect for the risks involved - to minimize them and be aware of them .

but in a new tack , borloo said countries such as the united states , which have said they can not implement such deep cuts by 2020 , could contribute to a new climate pact in other ways , for example by financing green technologies for developing nations .
this would give such nations the chance to catch up with emission reductions later on .
" there can be more flexibility among us , " borloo told the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in paris on monday .
" there may be some who act faster and others who do more later .
" there may be constraints on such and such a developed nation - but we must reach this 2020 objective of 25 to 40 percent , " he said .

they charge that developed countries have not kept their promises to take the lead in cutting the burning of fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said , however , that developing countries were also not ready to commit to decreasing carbon emissions .

the role of the forums is to identify common ground between the world 's major emitters ahead of a major united nations climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
it is hoped that a new , planet-wide treaty regulating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can be agreed at the december meeting .
any new pact would take effect after 2012 , when the current conventions under the kyoto protocol are due to expire .
" the world 's destiny will probably be at stake in copenhagen , " borloo said .
" copenhagen is not a retrograde vision , it 's not the start of negative -lrb- economic -rrb- growth , but a new start for strong , sustainable , sober carbon development . "

but in a new tack , borloo said countries such as the united states , which have said they can not implement such deep cuts by 2020 , could contribute to a new climate pact in other ways , for example by financing green technologies for developing nations .
this would give such nations the chance to catch up with emission reductions later on .
" there can be more flexibility among us , " borloo told the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in paris on monday .
" there may be some who act faster and others who do more later .
" there may be constraints on such and such a developed nation - but we must reach this 2020 objective of 25 to 40 percent , " he said .
finger pointing continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel says developing countries are still waiting for rich nations to act first developing nations led by china and india have accused rich nations of giving their economies greater priority than fighting climate change .
they charge that developed countries have not kept their promises to take the lead in cutting the burning of fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said , however , that developing countries were also not ready to commit to decreasing carbon emissions .
" the longer it takes for industrialized nations to have a common position , the longer we will have to wait until china and india move -lrb- on climate change -rrb- , " he said in paris .
copenhagen hopes the mef was called last month by us president barack obama .
it is the second of three preparatory gatherings ahead of another climate summit to be held in italy in july .
the role of the forums is to identify common ground between the world 's major emitters ahead of a major united nations climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
it is hoped that a new , planet-wide treaty regulating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can be agreed at the december meeting .
any new pact would take effect after 2012 , when the current conventions under the kyoto protocol are due to expire .
" the world 's destiny will probably be at stake in copenhagen , " borloo said .
" copenhagen is not a retrograde vision , it 's not the start of negative -lrb- economic -rrb- growth , but a new start for strong , sustainable , sober carbon development . "
us defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consensus is that time is running out for major polluters to ratify a new treaty a us congressional panel last week approved a bill that would cut us carbon emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 .
the european union , meanwhile , has pledged cuts of 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and 30 percent if other wealthy nations get on board .
despite the disparity , us officials maintain their country is pulling its weight .
" i do n't think it 's correct to say that europe is proposing a lot and the united states little , " todd stern , us special envoy for climate change , told tuesday 's edition of the french daily le monde .
" if you look at things from the point of view of the progress that each nation will have to make to reach its objectives , the us level of effort is probably equal , or superior , to that of europe , " stern added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 25.05.2009 international german archive recounts jazz ' turbulent history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american jazz traveled swiftly across the atlantic in the 20th century frowned upon and even banned under the nazi and communist regimes , jazz has had a rough time in 20th-century germany .
the international jazz archive in eisenach which documents it all is celebrating its 10th anniversary . it 's not beginning that 's rewarded , but persevering , said reinhard lorenz .
as one of the co-founders of the international jazz archive in eisenach , lorenz , the head of the town 's culture department , knows what he 's talking about : he 's helped develop the archive over the past decade . located just a few steps from the town center , the archive is located in the historic old malthouse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.05.2009 voter apathy reflects lack of interest in eu affairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentary elections are a pretty dull affair the latest poll into who will vote in the upcoming european parliamentary elections on june 4-7 makes for some pretty grim reading .
it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink . a study carried out across the eu on behalf of the french political innovation foundation shows that 18 percent of those surveyed said they were ' not at all interested ' in the june poll , whilst 35 percent said they were ' rather not interested ' .
the same number said they were ' rather interested ' but only a meager 11 percent said they were ' very interested ' . the data coming in on voter apathy across the european union is turning unspoken but common knowledge into hard facts : the eu elections hold no interest for a huge number of the bloc 's citizens . what is less clear are the reasons why .
attempts have been made to connect the expected dramatically low turn-out with frustration over the incompetence of ministers , the mounting corruption scandals and the perceived idleness that voters associate with the overblown bureaucracy many believe the eu has become . but to equate the apparent refusal of so many europeans to head to the polls with an act of protest assumes that many people actually know or care what happens in brussels and strasbourg .
election experts believe it 's a lot simpler than that . " the european parliament is very important and the people who work there have an important role , but no-one has bothered to explain this to the voters , " professor mark franklin , chair of the european election studies steering group , told deutsche welle .
" it 's not clear what the european parliament does , it 's certainly not clear as to what difference it makes and it regularly throws up electoral lists full of unrecognizable names and faces .
it all adds up to the opinion that there 's no point to any of it . " boring election with no pay-off dr. hermann schmitt , project director at the mannheim center for european social research , told deutsche welle that he thought the lack of a tangible end product was turning voters off . " we know that people are disinterested , even to the degree that they don ’ t even know what 's going on , " he said .
" the main reason for this is that the european elections are seen to be quite unimportant .
this is because , in the european parliament election , the thing that characterizes a normal election is not going to happen – that is , a government is not going to be formed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are not immune from election lethargy " it 's not that people are staying away from these elections because they are critical of the european union and its political process ; it 's just that these elections are so boring and one does n't know why one should participate because not much is going to happen as a result of it , " he added . european parliamentary election turnout has fallen steadily from 66 percent in 1979 to just over 45 percent in 2004 , and in most member states is amongst the lowest for any form of poll . professor franklin is not surprised at all by the predicted voting figures .
he is , if anything , surprised that so many are saying that they intend to take part in this election . " the most amazing thing is that anyone votes at all , " he said .
" why would anyone vote in an election where they have no idea what 's at stake , what the issues are and what , if any , difference the election will have on their lives ?
that ’ s the case with all european elections . " three voting groups make up the numbers franklin believes that those who will vote will come from three groups which can always be relied upon to take part in elections .
these groups vote out of loyalty , habit or just because they want a change of pace . bildunterschrift : the greens traditionally benefit from expressive votes " we have the party loyalists who react to calls from their leaders to vote and save their party humiliation ; then there are those who vote out of habit , who generally believe that voting is a good thing and that they should exercise that right to vote , and then there are the expressive voters who tend to vote for parties , such as the greens , for whom they would n't normally vote in national elections , " he said . " these expressive votes usually come about because the voters know that it doesn ’ t matter who they vote for , because they think it wo n't matter anyway , it just gives them a chance to support someone different . " while eurocrats may be worried about keeping their jobs , a more serious concern is that the expected low turn-out could have unpleasant consequences for the make-up of the future parliament and the political spectrum in europe . lower turn-out plays into extremist hands the lower the turnout , the easier it will be for more radical parties to do well .
as in the 1930s , rising extremism is seen as a key potential risk from the financial crisis and resulting rise in unemployment and hardship . that could potentially see a rise both for far-left parties and right-wingers , including those angry at rising immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's extremist bnp could benefit from voter apathy anti-foreigner rhetoric , and in some cases violence , have increased in several countries in recent months .
analysts are watching the potential rise of the far-right in hungary and the nationalist british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , amongst others . " a low turn-out would certainly have implications in terms of niche or radical fringe parties , " professor franklin said .
" this is where the expressive voters come in .
they may make a choice to vote for a far-right or far-left party because of the reasons i gave before , that they believe that it wo n't make a difference .
they wouldn ’ t do this in national elections because it may have an impact , but in europe – who cares ? " what could happen , though , is that these extremist parties , for example an anti-eu party , may take seats away from others and then make the passing of legislation almost impossible , freezing the political process , " he added . franklin also believes that politics on a national level may suffer across europe as a result . eu elections could color the national voting experience " this european election experience may be the first time that around 50 percent of voters in the eu vote for the first time , " he said .
" if this is their first experience of an electoral vote , imagine what that can do to their opinion of the democratic process !
the next time there 's a national vote , the domestic parties may say , ' those eu elections were n't that important but these ones are ' – but by then an opinion is already starting to form that all elections are pointless , especially among young voters .
this is one of the reasons why national turn-outs are also on the wane across europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign fight involving barroso might excite voters both franklin and schmitt say that a change in the process where electable figureheads are campaigning for office – be it the president of the commission or a future european president – could help encourage people to vote in european elections . " if the parliament would elect the president of the commission and two or three competing candidates would run in these elections , things would be different and turn-out would increase , " schmitt said .
" elections are about horse races , elections are about who is going to govern , elections are about people and faces and whether you like them or you do n't . " a real race - but who would want to run ? " to make the european elections more attractive , the process could include a number of presidential candidates who are running against each other , " franklin said .
" then there will be other politicians who will stand and say ' i support such and such because of this and that ' .
we might then get a debate about what these people intend to do .
it will be a real election with electable faces and personalities . " however , franklin believes that turning european elections into a sexy presidential race will probably not happen any time soon . " someone once said that electing a european president would relegate people , like the president of france , into a role no more important than the governor of texas , " he said .
" real elections for a european president would make national leaders even less relevant , and which politician would want that ? " author : nick amies editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concluding their two-day meeting on monday , the g8 nations said governments and businesses must work to keep energy prices stable or risk hampering a recovery .
in a joint declaration , the g8 nations and 15 visiting delegations from emerging economies attending the conference called on investors to improve access to energy in poor countries and develop new technologies to reduce emissions that cause climate change .
" we urge governments and energy companies to adopt a long-term view in planning their investments in energy infrastructure , " the ministers said in a closing statement .
investment , regulation needed to stabilize energy market the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said on monday that falling oil prices , tight credit markets and slumping demand had prompted oil producers to delay or scrap $ 170 billion worth of investments .
saudi arabia warned that oil prices could spike to beyond the near $ 150 record high of 2008 within three years , if there was not more investment to boost production over the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aging oil rigs need fresh capital in a speech distributed to the media , roberto poli , the ceo of italian energy group eni , said , " the persistence of high uncertainties related to oil prices up to $ 150 per barrel , or down to $ 30 , could upset the entire energy system , blocking investments both in traditional and alternative sources . "
in order to stabilize prices , poli urged governments to institute more regulation of oil financial markets , which he called " opaque and uncontrollable . "
the group of eight is looking for ways to ensure steady oil and gas supplies at reasonable prices , while allowing for moderate price increases to make it financially worthwhile for energy companies to explore for oil and gas deposits .
the energy meeting - which included the united states , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia - will present a draft energy strategy to a g8 leaders ' summit , scheduled for july in l 'aquila , italy. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a 33-year-old german geophysicist , gerst will prepare to travel to space in september . deutsche welle : congratulations on being selected as one of the european space agency 's astronauts .
what was your first reaction when you got the news ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst said he is not afraid of being shot into space alexander gerst : it was the greatest feeling i could imagine at that time .
it was obviously a great dream of mine that i 'd had for most of my life that was fulfilled at that moment .
it 's hard to describe . you are basically living a dream ? yes , i was .
for me it is a long-standing dream to explore our planet and the space around it .
i was always a very curious person .
as a child i turned over every stone and looked behind every tree and i liked to explore .
for me now , after becoming a scientist , which allows me to do those things down here on earth , this new job offers me the chance to do the same in space which is the ultimate way for me to do science and exploration . thousands of people sent in applications to become one of europe 's astronauts .
how difficult was the selection process ? some of the tests were , obviously , quite tough - even for a successful candidate , they were n't easy at all .
i never went out of a test saying , " i 've got this one in the bag . "
i always came out with mixed feelings .
i said , " well , i did n't do so bad , but i also was n't really good at it . "
in the end it worked out , but it 's hard to tell .
some of the tests felt quite easy and natural and some others were very tough . what do you think it was that singled you out from the thousands of others during the grueling , year-long process for the role of european astronaut ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of training are necessary before stepping out into space i 'm actually not completely sure .
i think it might be a little of everything .
certainly there was some luck involved .
i considered myself lucky that my body was good enough to pass the medical test , which i 'm not fully responsible for . a very important component is fascination - fascination for the space program , fascination for the job .
that fascination leads to persistence to follow through with all the tests and all the preparations and to not give up on the way . another very important criterion is working in teams .
i 've shown through experiences i 've had in antarctica that i can perform in a team , and many others have done so as well , and i think that 's a very important criterion for the european space agency . you are a geophysicist , four of the other people chosen are pilots and the fifth works with guidance systems .
what role do you think your position as a scientist plays ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst conducted some of his research in antarctica every good team has to be a diverse one .
the charter of european astronauts says " unity through diversity , " and that 's the motto of all of europe in my opinion .
therefore , i think the european space agency did well by choosing a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences - only then can everyone contribute their experience to the bigger team experience . are you worried about what the future now holds for you ? i would n't call it worried , but it 's certainly a challenge .
i 've got a lot of press attention , but i do n't consider myself someone who has done a lot .
the european space agency puts a huge amount of trust in me and i do n't want to disappoint .
it 's a challenge and i 'm aware that i would like to perform as people expect . does the prospect of being strapped into a rocket and blasted into space frighten you ? no , not at all .
i 'm fascinated by that prospect . i do n't think fear is a helpful emotion in that respect .
i ca n't speak as an astronaut , of course , since i have n't flown yet , but as a scientist who has worked on active volcanoes i know that fear makes us irrational , which can sometimes be dangerous .
that is not a helpful feeling , but what is very important , at the same time , is to have respect for the risks involved - to minimize them and be aware of them .
so respect , yes , but fear , no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moon is a still a far-off goal for the new batch of future astronauts training for future missions to the international space station begins in september , and there is also a chance you could go to the moon in collaboration with nasa and other space agencies .
what will you , personally , be looking forward to ? the moon program is quite far away , so i ca n't put myself in any role there because it 's certainly not clear who is going to be on that mission .
i would personally love to be there .
i know that the moon is full of treasures for us . i would rather concentrate now on closer things , like my training and , after that , flights to the international space station . there is a lot of science to be done there that is so important for us down here on earth .
in economic and scientific ways there is very important research to be done up there and that is what i would like to concentrate on most . interview : rajiv sharma -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german business confidence rose in may for the second time in a row .

any improvements after that will be " anemic . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 25.05.2009 hezbollah denies german media reports of involvement in hariri death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese police at the scene of the hariri bombing the lebanon-based militant group hezbollah has been forced on to the back foot over allegations made by a german news magazine that it was behind the assassination of former prime minister rafik al-hariri in 2005 . in a statement posted on its web site , hezbollah rejected the allegations , calling them " fabrications " that were intended to affect the outcome of lebanese general elections on june 7 .
" publishing these accusations and attributing them to sources close to the international court dents the credibility of the tribunal and its work and requires firm and clear action towards the publishers of these evil fabrications , " it added .
german weekly news magazine der spiegel quoted sources close to the united nations special tribunal for lebanon – which is tasked with investigating the assassination of hariri – saying that lebanese investigators had , for the first time , linked hezbollah ’ s " operational arm " with a number of cell phones used in the area at the time of hariri ’ s death . on february 14 , 2005 , a truck filled with explosives blew up near hariri 's motorcade , killing him and 22 others .
initial un investigations implicated syrian and lebanese military officers but these details were later withheld pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster of slain former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri " the investigation … is ongoing , work is continuing , unfortunately for purposes of maintaining the confidentiality of our work this is an investigation that looks like any police investigation throughout the world and it can not be debated throughout the media , " said radhia achouri , spokesperson for daniel bellemare , chief prosecutor for the un special tribunal . " we do n't know where -lrb- spiegel is -rrb- getting the story from , " she added . mixed reactions russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , who was meeting with lebanese government officials in beirut , denounced the german report as provocative , while syria ’ s foreign minister said the article undermined the international investigation into hariri ’ s death . saying that un investigators had not questioned anyone from hezbollah , lebanese foreign minister fawzi salloukh said that der spiegel 's article was " totally false . " in israel , however , foreign minister avigdor lieberman is reported to have told a weekly cabinet meeting that the article " just proves who we are dealing with . " political consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saad al-hariri and his supporters could stand to earn the vote of lebanese christians the latest twist in the hariri investigation comes at a time when the two factions contesting the upcoming general election are locked in a dead heat .
on one side are the us-backed so-called " march 14 " forces , led by saad al-hariri - the son of rafik al-hariri – which holds a parliamentary majority .
on the other side is hezbollah , which is supported by iran and syria . gil yaron , a middle east analyst and journalist working in the region , says that if the allegations were confirmed , that could cause lebanese christian swing voters to turn their backs on hezbollah in support of the sunni forces under saad al-hariri , thus delivering his party victory . " in addition to this , these allegations could have international repercussions .
the arab states will certainly be very upset with hezbollah , would it turn out that hezbollah has killed a sunni , very prominent politician , " yaron said . " but also the new policy of rapprochement that the uk and other european states have formulated trying to talk to hezbollah , would certainly see a revaluation , should it turn out that hezbollah is a terrorist organization which also kills arab politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 25.05.2009 politician criticizes reality tv show starring borrowed babies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers quickly find out that it 's not always easy to be a parent german child advocates are throwing a tantrum about a new reality tv show .
" maturity test " follows teenagers as they struggle to care for borrowed babies .
germany 's family minister has also weighed in against the show . german family minister ursula von der leyen is the latest and most prominent german child advocate to speak out against private television channel rtl 's decision to go ahead with “ erwachsen auf probe ” , or " grown-up on probation " . von der leyen urged rtl to either “ stop the show or thoroughly re-work it . ”
yet rtl has said it will do no such thing and intends to air the first episode on june 3 as planned .
the show follows four teenage couples who have said they want to become parents .
the teenagers are given a borrowed baby to care for over several days and tv crews document their struggles to change diapers and quiet temper tantrums .
the show poses the question : are these teenagers really ready to take on parenthood ?
children " at risk " criticism from child advocates has been building in recent weeks .
german child advocates say the show exploits the young children who are being loaned out to inexperienced teenagers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen says the show could harm the children involved “ one asks oneself the entire time : what about the children ?
where are their rights ? ” von der leyen told spiegel magazine .
the german parliament 's commission for children issued a statement in which it chastised rtl for using children as guinea pigs and for “ exploiting children in an irresponsible manner . ”
the commission urged rtl not to air the series .
germany 's federation for the protection of children has also weighed in , saying it is " furious " at the concept , which it claims puts children at " high risk . "
the show has cleared all necessary regulatory hurdles .
rtl has pointed out that the babies are monitored around the clock by child psychologists and doctors to ensure that the inexperienced caregivers do no harm and that the parents are also just off camera .
“ we have kept the well-being of the children , couples and parents who are participating in mind as well as the effect on our viewers , ” rtl ceo anke schaeferkordt said .
“ we have taken our responsibility very seriously . ”
teen pregnancy in the spotlight in response to recent criticism , rtl published an interview with one mother , identified as katrin , who lent her 10-month-old son lasse to the program .
the woman said she did not fear for her son 's safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show 's planners say they intend to spark a discussion about teen pregnancy “ the trial parents managed very well , lasse managed very well and there was always a pediatrician or someone else nearby … lasse had so much fun during the project , ” the mother said .
rtl views the show , which is an adaptation of the bbc 's " the baby borrowers " , as helping to usher in an important discussion over teen pregnancy .
von der leyen dismissed this rationale , saying that teen pregnancy is a topic well covered by german schools .
she told spiegel that , while teenage pregnancy is a pressing issue in the uk , it is much less of a problem in germany .

" maturity test " follows teenagers as they struggle to care for borrowed babies .
germany 's family minister has also weighed in against the show . german family minister ursula von der leyen is the latest and most prominent german child advocate to speak out against private television channel rtl 's decision to go ahead with “ erwachsen auf probe ” , or " grown-up on probation " . von der leyen urged rtl to either “ stop the show or thoroughly re-work it . ”
yet rtl has said it will do no such thing and intends to air the first episode on june 3 as planned .
the show follows four teenage couples who have said they want to become parents .
the teenagers are given a borrowed baby to care for over several days and tv crews document their struggles to change diapers and quiet temper tantrums .
the show poses the question : are these teenagers really ready to take on parenthood ?
children " at risk " criticism from child advocates has been building in recent weeks .
german child advocates say the show exploits the young children who are being loaned out to inexperienced teenagers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen says the show could harm the children involved “ one asks oneself the entire time : what about the children ?
where are their rights ? ” von der leyen told spiegel magazine .
the german parliament 's commission for children issued a statement in which it chastised rtl for using children as guinea pigs and for “ exploiting children in an irresponsible manner . ”
the commission urged rtl not to air the series .
germany 's federation for the protection of children has also weighed in , saying it is " furious " at the concept , which it claims puts children at " high risk . "
the show has cleared all necessary regulatory hurdles .
rtl has pointed out that the babies are monitored around the clock by child psychologists and doctors to ensure that the inexperienced caregivers do no harm and that the parents are also just off camera .
“ we have kept the well-being of the children , couples and parents who are participating in mind as well as the effect on our viewers , ” rtl ceo anke schaeferkordt said .
“ we have taken our responsibility very seriously . ”
teen pregnancy in the spotlight in response to recent criticism , rtl published an interview with one mother , identified as katrin , who lent her 10-month-old son lasse to the program .
the woman said she did not fear for her son 's safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show 's planners say they intend to spark a discussion about teen pregnancy “ the trial parents managed very well , lasse managed very well and there was always a pediatrician or someone else nearby … lasse had so much fun during the project , ” the mother said .
rtl views the show , which is an adaptation of the bbc 's " the baby borrowers " , as helping to usher in an important discussion over teen pregnancy .
von der leyen dismissed this rationale , saying that teen pregnancy is a topic well covered by german schools .
she told spiegel that , while teenage pregnancy is a pressing issue in the uk , it is much less of a problem in germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show 's planners say they intend to spark a discussion about teen pregnancy “ the trial parents managed very well , lasse managed very well and there was always a pediatrician or someone else nearby … lasse had so much fun during the project , ” the mother said .
rtl views the show , which is an adaptation of the bbc 's " the baby borrowers " , as helping to usher in an important discussion over teen pregnancy .
von der leyen dismissed this rationale , saying that teen pregnancy is a topic well covered by german schools .
she told spiegel that , while teenage pregnancy is a pressing issue in the uk , it is much less of a problem in germany .
according to unicef statistics , german teenagers account for 13 out of each 1,000 births .
in comparison , british teenagers account for 30 of 1,000 births and the united states has 52 per 1,000 births. th / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the parent company of troubled german department store karstadt is warning that it could go bankrupt if the government does n't provide aid .
but competitors say such a move would be unfair . arcandor has stepped up pressure on the german government to lend it a helping hand .
in interviews over the weekend , the heads of arcandor and its karstadt department store unit warned that without taxpayer assistance to the tune of 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- some 50,000 jobs would be threatened .
arcandor runs not only the karstadt department store chain , but also the mail-order retailer quelle and the thomas cook travel company .
bankruptcy threat " there is no private economic solution .
there is no alternative to state aid , " arcandor ceo karl-gerhard eick told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
he repeated his demand for 650 million euros in loan guarantees and a 200-million-euro credit in saturday 's edition of the bild newspaper .
" without guarantees we have to find a new route , and that could include bankruptcy , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt rejects the idea of a kaufhof merger meanwhile , karstadt ceo stefan herzberg told the sunday edition of bild : " the lives of more than 50,000 workers could be disrupted . "
furthermore , he warned , a bankruptcy could have an effect on suppliers and ulitmately it could be " a catastrophe for germany 's downtown shopping zones . "
cool response from politicians so far , politicians appear to be unmoved by the threats .
to date , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has reacted cautiously to the arcandor warnings .
and volker kauder , a leading member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , rejected the notion of state aid for karstadt , noting that the firm was already in trouble before the current banking crisis began .
furthermore , one of arcandor 's competitors , tengelmann , has loudly rejected the company 's bid for public funding .
in an interview with wirtschaftswoche magazine , tengelmann ceo karl-erivan haub said state aid for karstadt " would be a slap in the face for all the companies that had done a good management job " in the past .
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung newspaper has also raised the question of whether karstadt is n't simply stuck in financial turmoil of its own making .
the paper said suppliers had already recalled wares due to lack of payment , and that employee pay is only secured through may .
retailers suffering arcandor 's eick also rejected the idea of a recently discussed merger between karstadt and kaufhof , germany 's other major department store , saying it would be insufficient to prevent the collapse of arcandor .
the merger is merely a poorly disguised attempt by kaufhof to drive karstadt into bankruptcy and to pick off individual karstadt department stores , according to eick .

the parent company of troubled german department store karstadt is warning that it could go bankrupt if the government does n't provide aid .
but competitors say such a move would be unfair . arcandor has stepped up pressure on the german government to lend it a helping hand .
in interviews over the weekend , the heads of arcandor and its karstadt department store unit warned that without taxpayer assistance to the tune of 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- some 50,000 jobs would be threatened .
arcandor runs not only the karstadt department store chain , but also the mail-order retailer quelle and the thomas cook travel company .
bankruptcy threat " there is no private economic solution .
there is no alternative to state aid , " arcandor ceo karl-gerhard eick told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
he repeated his demand for 650 million euros in loan guarantees and a 200-million-euro credit in saturday 's edition of the bild newspaper .
" without guarantees we have to find a new route , and that could include bankruptcy , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt rejects the idea of a kaufhof merger meanwhile , karstadt ceo stefan herzberg told the sunday edition of bild : " the lives of more than 50,000 workers could be disrupted . "
furthermore , he warned , a bankruptcy could have an effect on suppliers and ulitmately it could be " a catastrophe for germany 's downtown shopping zones . "
cool response from politicians so far , politicians appear to be unmoved by the threats .
to date , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has reacted cautiously to the arcandor warnings .
and volker kauder , a leading member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , rejected the notion of state aid for karstadt , noting that the firm was already in trouble before the current banking crisis began .
furthermore , one of arcandor 's competitors , tengelmann , has loudly rejected the company 's bid for public funding .
in an interview with wirtschaftswoche magazine , tengelmann ceo karl-erivan haub said state aid for karstadt " would be a slap in the face for all the companies that had done a good management job " in the past .
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung newspaper has also raised the question of whether karstadt is n't simply stuck in financial turmoil of its own making .
the paper said suppliers had already recalled wares due to lack of payment , and that employee pay is only secured through may .
retailers suffering arcandor 's eick also rejected the idea of a recently discussed merger between karstadt and kaufhof , germany 's other major department store , saying it would be insufficient to prevent the collapse of arcandor .

" maturity test " follows teenagers as they struggle to care for borrowed babies .
germany 's family minister has also weighed in against the show . german family minister ursula von der leyen is the latest and most prominent german child advocate to speak out against private television channel rtl 's decision to go ahead with “ erwachsen auf probe ” , or " grown-up on probation " . von der leyen urged rtl to either “ stop the show or thoroughly re-work it . ”
yet rtl has said it will do no such thing and intends to air the first episode on june 3 as planned .
the show follows four teenage couples who have said they want to become parents .
the teenagers are given a borrowed baby to care for over several days and tv crews document their struggles to change diapers and quiet temper tantrums .
the show poses the question : are these teenagers really ready to take on parenthood ?
children " at risk " criticism from child advocates has been building in recent weeks .
german child advocates say the show exploits the young children who are being loaned out to inexperienced teenagers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen says the show could harm the children involved “ one asks oneself the entire time : what about the children ?
where are their rights ? ” von der leyen told spiegel magazine .
the german parliament 's commission for children issued a statement in which it chastised rtl for using children as guinea pigs and for “ exploiting children in an irresponsible manner . ”
the commission urged rtl not to air the series .
germany 's federation for the protection of children has also weighed in , saying it is " furious " at the concept , which it claims puts children at " high risk . "
the show has cleared all necessary regulatory hurdles .
rtl has pointed out that the babies are monitored around the clock by child psychologists and doctors to ensure that the inexperienced caregivers do no harm and that the parents are also just off camera .
“ we have kept the well-being of the children , couples and parents who are participating in mind as well as the effect on our viewers , ” rtl ceo anke schaeferkordt said .
“ we have taken our responsibility very seriously . ”
teen pregnancy in the spotlight in response to recent criticism , rtl published an interview with one mother , identified as katrin , who lent her 10-month-old son lasse to the program .
the woman said she did not fear for her son 's safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show 's planners say they intend to spark a discussion about teen pregnancy “ the trial parents managed very well , lasse managed very well and there was always a pediatrician or someone else nearby … lasse had so much fun during the project , ” the mother said .
rtl views the show , which is an adaptation of the bbc 's " the baby borrowers " , as helping to usher in an important discussion over teen pregnancy .
von der leyen dismissed this rationale , saying that teen pregnancy is a topic well covered by german schools .
she told spiegel that , while teenage pregnancy is a pressing issue in the uk , it is much less of a problem in germany .
according to unicef statistics , german teenagers account for 13 out of each 1,000 births .
in comparison , british teenagers account for 30 of 1,000 births and the united states has 52 per 1,000 births. th / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the north conducted the test early on monday , detonating a bomb some 10 kilometers underground in the same area where it conducted an initial nuclear test in october , 2006 .
pyongyang test-fired three short-range , ground-to-air missiles later on monday from the site from which it launched a rocket last month , a south korean news agency reported , citing unnamed sources .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , condemned the test , saying it further threatened peace and security in northeast asia .
" these irresponsible acts by north korea warrant a firm response by the international community .
the european union will be in contact with its partners to discuss appropriate measures , " solana said in a statement .
the czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he was " very much disturbed " by north korea 's announcement that it had " successfully " carried out a nuclear test .
british prime minister gordon brown described the decision to carry out the tests as " erroneous , misguided and a danger to the world " .
" this act will undermine prospects for peace on the korean peninsula and will do nothing for north korea 's security .
the international community will treat north korea as a partner if it behaves responsibly .
if it does not then it can expect only renewed isolation , " brown said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans have demanded that north korea 's kim jong il step down asian neighbors condemn test reactions to the test in asia were also swift .
in south korea , president lee myung-bak has called an emergency meeting of the country 's security council , and in japan officials have set up a task force in the crisis management center of prime minister taro aso 's office .
" it is an act that we can never tolerate , " japanese foreign minister hirofumi nakasone said in hanoi on the sidelines of talks between asian and european ministers .
" as it is a violation of un security council resolutions , japan condemns and protests it strongly .
we , as the only nation to have had a nuclear bomb used against us , feel the need to take stern action . "
second test “ much more ” powerful the united states geological survey -lrb- usgs -rrb- initially reported that it had detected a 4.5-magnitude earthquake in the northeast of north korea . ´ the north korean central news agency confirmed the test shortly after the usgs registered the quake .
the force of the blast was reported to be between 10 and 20 kilotons , a size comparable to that of the atomic bomb explosions in nagasaki and hiroshima at the close of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : monday 's underground blast was as powerful as the atomic bomb the us dropped on hiroshima this second north korean nuclear test was much more powerful than the first in 2006 , which registered a force not greater than one kiloton .
the north vows to continue tests " the test will contribute to safeguarding our sovereignty and socialism and guaranteeing peace and safety on the korean peninsula and the surrounding region . " said the statement from north korea 's official news agency .
a senior official at pyongyang 's embassy in moscow told the itar-tass news agency on monday that north korea will continue to carry out nuclear tests until western nations , led by the united states , bring an end to policies of " intimidation .

the north conducted the test early on monday , detonating a bomb some 10 kilometers underground in the same area where it conducted an initial nuclear test in october , 2006 .
pyongyang test-fired three short-range , ground-to-air missiles later on monday from the site from which it launched a rocket last month , a south korean news agency reported , citing unnamed sources .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , condemned the test , saying it further threatened peace and security in northeast asia .
" these irresponsible acts by north korea warrant a firm response by the international community .
the european union will be in contact with its partners to discuss appropriate measures , " solana said in a statement .
the czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he was " very much disturbed " by north korea 's announcement that it had " successfully " carried out a nuclear test .
british prime minister gordon brown described the decision to carry out the tests as " erroneous , misguided and a danger to the world " .
" this act will undermine prospects for peace on the korean peninsula and will do nothing for north korea 's security .
the international community will treat north korea as a partner if it behaves responsibly .
if it does not then it can expect only renewed isolation , " brown said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans have demanded that north korea 's kim jong il step down asian neighbors condemn test reactions to the test in asia were also swift .
in south korea , president lee myung-bak has called an emergency meeting of the country 's security council , and in japan officials have set up a task force in the crisis management center of prime minister taro aso 's office .
" it is an act that we can never tolerate , " japanese foreign minister hirofumi nakasone said in hanoi on the sidelines of talks between asian and european ministers .
" as it is a violation of un security council resolutions , japan condemns and protests it strongly .
we , as the only nation to have had a nuclear bomb used against us , feel the need to take stern action . "
second test “ much more ” powerful the united states geological survey -lrb- usgs -rrb- initially reported that it had detected a 4.5-magnitude earthquake in the northeast of north korea . ´ the north korean central news agency confirmed the test shortly after the usgs registered the quake .
the force of the blast was reported to be between 10 and 20 kilotons , a size comparable to that of the atomic bomb explosions in nagasaki and hiroshima at the close of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : monday 's underground blast was as powerful as the atomic bomb the us dropped on hiroshima this second north korean nuclear test was much more powerful than the first in 2006 , which registered a force not greater than one kiloton .
the north vows to continue tests " the test will contribute to safeguarding our sovereignty and socialism and guaranteeing peace and safety on the korean peninsula and the surrounding region . " said the statement from north korea 's official news agency .
a senior official at pyongyang 's embassy in moscow told the itar-tass news agency on monday that north korea will continue to carry out nuclear tests until western nations , led by the united states , bring an end to policies of " intimidation .

ministers meeting in brussels on monday also adopted a set of common standards and sanctions against employers who hire illegal foreign immigrants .
these include making it mandatory for businesses to ensure that non-eu workers hold a valid residence permit and that a copy of such permits be kept on record should inspectors demand to see it .
eu-wide penalties would consist of fines , which would increase according to the number of illegally employed foreigners , and the possible exclusion of guilty businesses from accessing public funds or taking part in public tenders .
new rules designed to end abuses on the other hand , signing up to the blue card scheme would give foreign workers limited social welfare rights and benefits , and allow them to bring in their families while they work in an eu country .
the new rules are designed to end abuses by unscrupulous employers who hire illegal immigrants and then pay them sub-standard wages under poor working conditions .
the european commission 's far more ambitious initial proposal was watered down significantly by national governments , which insisted that it should be up to them to decide how many migrants should enter their countries and what qualifications eligible workers should have .

ministers meeting in brussels on monday also adopted a set of common standards and sanctions against employers who hire illegal foreign immigrants .
these include making it mandatory for businesses to ensure that non-eu workers hold a valid residence permit and that a copy of such permits be kept on record should inspectors demand to see it .
eu-wide penalties would consist of fines , which would increase according to the number of illegally employed foreigners , and the possible exclusion of guilty businesses from accessing public funds or taking part in public tenders .
new rules designed to end abuses on the other hand , signing up to the blue card scheme would give foreign workers limited social welfare rights and benefits , and allow them to bring in their families while they work in an eu country .
the new rules are designed to end abuses by unscrupulous employers who hire illegal immigrants and then pay them sub-standard wages under poor working conditions .
the european commission 's far more ambitious initial proposal was watered down significantly by national governments , which insisted that it should be up to them to decide how many migrants should enter their countries and what qualifications eligible workers should have .
three eu members - britain , ireland and denmark - are not participating in the blue card program , preferring instead to set their own guidelines. gb / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the north conducted the test early on monday , detonating a bomb some 10 kilometers underground in the same area where it conducted an initial nuclear test in october , 2006 .
pyongyang test-fired three short-range , ground-to-air missiles later on monday from the site from which it launched a rocket last month , a south korean news agency reported , citing unnamed sources .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , condemned the test , saying it further threatened peace and security in northeast asia .
" these irresponsible acts by north korea warrant a firm response by the international community .
the european union will be in contact with its partners to discuss appropriate measures , " solana said in a statement .
the czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he was " very much disturbed " by north korea 's announcement that it had " successfully " carried out a nuclear test .
british prime minister gordon brown described the decision to carry out the tests as " erroneous , misguided and a danger to the world " .
" this act will undermine prospects for peace on the korean peninsula and will do nothing for north korea 's security .
the international community will treat north korea as a partner if it behaves responsibly .
if it does not then it can expect only renewed isolation , " brown said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.05.2009 voter apathy reflects lack of interest in eu affairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentary elections are a pretty dull affair the latest poll into who will vote in the upcoming european parliamentary elections on june 4-7 makes for some pretty grim reading .
it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink . a study carried out across the eu on behalf of the french political innovation foundation shows that 18 percent of those surveyed said they were ' not at all interested ' in the june poll , whilst 35 percent said they were ' rather not interested ' .
the same number said they were ' rather interested ' but only a meager 11 percent said they were ' very interested ' . the data coming in on voter apathy across the european union is turning unspoken but common knowledge into hard facts : the eu elections hold no interest for a huge number of the bloc 's citizens . what is less clear are the reasons why .
attempts have been made to connect the expected dramatically low turn-out with frustration over the incompetence of ministers , the mounting corruption scandals and the perceived idleness that voters associate with the overblown bureaucracy many believe the eu has become . but to equate the apparent refusal of so many europeans to head to the polls with an act of protest assumes that many people actually know or care what happens in brussels and strasbourg .
election experts believe it 's a lot simpler than that . " the european parliament is very important and the people who work there have an important role , but no-one has bothered to explain this to the voters , " professor mark franklin , chair of the european election studies steering group , told deutsche welle .
" it 's not clear what the european parliament does , it 's certainly not clear as to what difference it makes and it regularly throws up electoral lists full of unrecognizable names and faces .
it all adds up to the opinion that there 's no point to any of it . " boring election with no pay-off dr. hermann schmitt , project director at the mannheim center for european social research , told deutsche welle that he thought the lack of a tangible end product was turning voters off . " we know that people are disinterested , even to the degree that they don ’ t even know what 's going on , " he said .
" the main reason for this is that the european elections are seen to be quite unimportant .
this is because , in the european parliament election , the thing that characterizes a normal election is not going to happen – that is , a government is not going to be formed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are not immune from election lethargy " it 's not that people are staying away from these elections because they are critical of the european union and its political process ; it 's just that these elections are so boring and one does n't know why one should participate because not much is going to happen as a result of it , " he added . european parliamentary election turnout has fallen steadily from 66 percent in 1979 to just over 45 percent in 2004 , and in most member states is amongst the lowest for any form of poll . professor franklin is not surprised at all by the predicted voting figures .
he is , if anything , surprised that so many are saying that they intend to take part in this election . " the most amazing thing is that anyone votes at all , " he said .
" why would anyone vote in an election where they have no idea what 's at stake , what the issues are and what , if any , difference the election will have on their lives ?
that ’ s the case with all european elections . " three voting groups make up the numbers franklin believes that those who will vote will come from three groups which can always be relied upon to take part in elections .
these groups vote out of loyalty , habit or just because they want a change of pace . bildunterschrift : the greens traditionally benefit from expressive votes " we have the party loyalists who react to calls from their leaders to vote and save their party humiliation ; then there are those who vote out of habit , who generally believe that voting is a good thing and that they should exercise that right to vote , and then there are the expressive voters who tend to vote for parties , such as the greens , for whom they would n't normally vote in national elections , " he said . " these expressive votes usually come about because the voters know that it doesn ’ t matter who they vote for , because they think it wo n't matter anyway , it just gives them a chance to support someone different . " while eurocrats may be worried about keeping their jobs , a more serious concern is that the expected low turn-out could have unpleasant consequences for the make-up of the future parliament and the political spectrum in europe . lower turn-out plays into extremist hands the lower the turnout , the easier it will be for more radical parties to do well .
as in the 1930s , rising extremism is seen as a key potential risk from the financial crisis and resulting rise in unemployment and hardship . that could potentially see a rise both for far-left parties and right-wingers , including those angry at rising immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's extremist bnp could benefit from voter apathy anti-foreigner rhetoric , and in some cases violence , have increased in several countries in recent months .
analysts are watching the potential rise of the far-right in hungary and the nationalist british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , amongst others . " a low turn-out would certainly have implications in terms of niche or radical fringe parties , " professor franklin said .
" this is where the expressive voters come in .
they may make a choice to vote for a far-right or far-left party because of the reasons i gave before , that they believe that it wo n't make a difference .
they wouldn ’ t do this in national elections because it may have an impact , but in europe – who cares ? " what could happen , though , is that these extremist parties , for example an anti-eu party , may take seats away from others and then make the passing of legislation almost impossible , freezing the political process , " he added . franklin also believes that politics on a national level may suffer across europe as a result . eu elections could color the national voting experience " this european election experience may be the first time that around 50 percent of voters in the eu vote for the first time , " he said .
" if this is their first experience of an electoral vote , imagine what that can do to their opinion of the democratic process !
the next time there 's a national vote , the domestic parties may say , ' those eu elections were n't that important but these ones are ' – but by then an opinion is already starting to form that all elections are pointless , especially among young voters .
this is one of the reasons why national turn-outs are also on the wane across europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign fight involving barroso might excite voters both franklin and schmitt say that a change in the process where electable figureheads are campaigning for office – be it the president of the commission or a future european president – could help encourage people to vote in european elections . " if the parliament would elect the president of the commission and two or three competing candidates would run in these elections , things would be different and turn-out would increase , " schmitt said .
" elections are about horse races , elections are about who is going to govern , elections are about people and faces and whether you like them or you do n't . " a real race - but who would want to run ? " to make the european elections more attractive , the process could include a number of presidential candidates who are running against each other , " franklin said .
" then there will be other politicians who will stand and say ' i support such and such because of this and that ' .
we might then get a debate about what these people intend to do .
it will be a real election with electable faces and personalities . " however , franklin believes that turning european elections into a sexy presidential race will probably not happen any time soon . " someone once said that electing a european president would relegate people , like the president of france , into a role no more important than the governor of texas , " he said .
" real elections for a european president would make national leaders even less relevant , and which politician would want that ? " author : nick amies editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include making it mandatory for businesses to ensure that non-eu workers hold a valid residence permit and that a copy of such permits be kept on record should inspectors demand to see it .
eu-wide penalties would consist of fines , which would increase according to the number of illegally employed foreigners , and the possible exclusion of guilty businesses from accessing public funds or taking part in public tenders .
new rules designed to end abuses on the other hand , signing up to the blue card scheme would give foreign workers limited social welfare rights and benefits , and allow them to bring in their families while they work in an eu country .
the new rules are designed to end abuses by unscrupulous employers who hire illegal immigrants and then pay them sub-standard wages under poor working conditions .

" maturity test " follows teenagers as they struggle to care for borrowed babies .
germany 's family minister has also weighed in against the show . german family minister ursula von der leyen is the latest and most prominent german child advocate to speak out against private television channel rtl 's decision to go ahead with “ erwachsen auf probe ” , or " grown-up on probation " . von der leyen urged rtl to either “ stop the show or thoroughly re-work it . ”
yet rtl has said it will do no such thing and intends to air the first episode on june 3 as planned .
the show follows four teenage couples who have said they want to become parents .
the teenagers are given a borrowed baby to care for over several days and tv crews document their struggles to change diapers and quiet temper tantrums .
the show poses the question : are these teenagers really ready to take on parenthood ?
children " at risk " criticism from child advocates has been building in recent weeks .
german child advocates say the show exploits the young children who are being loaned out to inexperienced teenagers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen says the show could harm the children involved “ one asks oneself the entire time : what about the children ?
where are their rights ? ” von der leyen told spiegel magazine .
the german parliament 's commission for children issued a statement in which it chastised rtl for using children as guinea pigs and for “ exploiting children in an irresponsible manner . ”
the commission urged rtl not to air the series .
germany 's federation for the protection of children has also weighed in , saying it is " furious " at the concept , which it claims puts children at " high risk . "
the show has cleared all necessary regulatory hurdles .
rtl has pointed out that the babies are monitored around the clock by child psychologists and doctors to ensure that the inexperienced caregivers do no harm and that the parents are also just off camera .
“ we have kept the well-being of the children , couples and parents who are participating in mind as well as the effect on our viewers , ” rtl ceo anke schaeferkordt said .
“ we have taken our responsibility very seriously . ”
teen pregnancy in the spotlight in response to recent criticism , rtl published an interview with one mother , identified as katrin , who lent her 10-month-old son lasse to the program .
the woman said she did not fear for her son 's safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show 's planners say they intend to spark a discussion about teen pregnancy “ the trial parents managed very well , lasse managed very well and there was always a pediatrician or someone else nearby … lasse had so much fun during the project , ” the mother said .
rtl views the show , which is an adaptation of the bbc 's " the baby borrowers " , as helping to usher in an important discussion over teen pregnancy .
von der leyen dismissed this rationale , saying that teen pregnancy is a topic well covered by german schools .
she told spiegel that , while teenage pregnancy is a pressing issue in the uk , it is much less of a problem in germany .
according to unicef statistics , german teenagers account for 13 out of each 1,000 births .
in comparison , british teenagers account for 30 of 1,000 births and the united states has 52 per 1,000 births. th / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 25.05.2009 international german archive recounts jazz ' turbulent history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american jazz traveled swiftly across the atlantic in the 20th century frowned upon and even banned under the nazi and communist regimes , jazz has had a rough time in 20th-century germany .
the international jazz archive in eisenach which documents it all is celebrating its 10th anniversary . it 's not beginning that 's rewarded , but persevering , said reinhard lorenz .
as one of the co-founders of the international jazz archive in eisenach , lorenz , the head of the town 's culture department , knows what he 's talking about : he 's helped develop the archive over the past decade . located just a few steps from the town center , the archive is located in the historic old malthouse .
downstairs in the vaulted cellar , live jazz is performed at club called " posaune " - or trombone . founded in 1959 , the jazz club has n't had an easy path , but without it , the archive would have been impossible .
eisenach is in what used to be east germany and , during the communist period , jazz was defamed because it came from the american " class enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive is housed in eisenach 's historic old malthouse but jazz fans in eisenach employed a small political trick to establish the " subversive " style of music - they said that jazz and folk were the voice of the american proletariat , which would have appealed to the communists . jewels of jazz " what there is to find under eisenach skies is unbelievable , " filmmaker wim wenders wrote in the guestbook at the international jazz archive while he was there doing research for his film " the soul of a man . " indeed , the archive is a treasure chest : 80,000 records and sound files , just as many photographs and negatives , 60,000 magazines , and numerous articles , posters , books , correspondence and films . the ground floor contains items that belonged to blues pianist guenter boas , who passed away in 1993 .
lorenz was fascinated by the man when he met him at a concert in former east germany . " guenter boas played with all the greats of this world - with armstrong , with fitzgerald and he corresponded with all the blues people , " said lorenz .
" we have over 1,000 letters here from his estate .
they 're music history treasures . " a life-size black-and-white picture of boas , hung over a leather sofa , greets visitors when they enter the archive . from the source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trevor richards entrusted what survived of his collection to the archive eisenach 's reputation for taking good care of jazz paraphernalia - a job done so far by volunteers - has reached all the way to new orleans . from what is considered to be the birthplace of jazz , percussionist trevor richards sent the archive a container full of records , books and percussion instruments .
a large part of his extensive collection had been damaged in hurricane katrina and what survived has been cleaned up and is now housed in eisenach . but in addition to the american articles , the archive also stays true to its local roots : a small museum portion informs visitors about jazz in former communist east germany with info boards and photographs . also in eisenach is the birth house of composer js bach has practically become a mecca for music lovers of all kinds and lorenz said he hopes the international jazz archive will soon become a significant center for jazz lovers and researchers alike . author : susanne von schenck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the international jazz archive in eisenach which documents it all is celebrating its 10th anniversary . it 's not beginning that 's rewarded , but persevering , said reinhard lorenz .
as one of the co-founders of the international jazz archive in eisenach , lorenz , the head of the town 's culture department , knows what he 's talking about : he 's helped develop the archive over the past decade . located just a few steps from the town center , the archive is located in the historic old malthouse .
downstairs in the vaulted cellar , live jazz is performed at club called " posaune " - or trombone . founded in 1959 , the jazz club has n't had an easy path , but without it , the archive would have been impossible .
eisenach is in what used to be east germany and , during the communist period , jazz was defamed because it came from the american " class enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive is housed in eisenach 's historic old malthouse but jazz fans in eisenach employed a small political trick to establish the " subversive " style of music - they said that jazz and folk were the voice of the american proletariat , which would have appealed to the communists . jewels of jazz " what there is to find under eisenach skies is unbelievable , " filmmaker wim wenders wrote in the guestbook at the international jazz archive while he was there doing research for his film " the soul of a man . " indeed , the archive is a treasure chest : 80,000 records and sound files , just as many photographs and negatives , 60,000 magazines , and numerous articles , posters , books , correspondence and films . the ground floor contains items that belonged to blues pianist guenter boas , who passed away in 1993 .
lorenz was fascinated by the man when he met him at a concert in former east germany . " guenter boas played with all the greats of this world - with armstrong , with fitzgerald and he corresponded with all the blues people , " said lorenz .
" we have over 1,000 letters here from his estate .
they 're music history treasures . " a life-size black-and-white picture of boas , hung over a leather sofa , greets visitors when they enter the archive . from the source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trevor richards entrusted what survived of his collection to the archive eisenach 's reputation for taking good care of jazz paraphernalia - a job done so far by volunteers - has reached all the way to new orleans . from what is considered to be the birthplace of jazz , percussionist trevor richards sent the archive a container full of records , books and percussion instruments .
a large part of his extensive collection had been damaged in hurricane katrina and what survived has been cleaned up and is now housed in eisenach . but in addition to the american articles , the archive also stays true to its local roots : a small museum portion informs visitors about jazz in former communist east germany with info boards and photographs . also in eisenach is the birth house of composer js bach has practically become a mecca for music lovers of all kinds and lorenz said he hopes the international jazz archive will soon become a significant center for jazz lovers and researchers alike . author : susanne von schenck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

concluding their two-day meeting on monday , the g8 nations said governments and businesses must work to keep energy prices stable or risk hampering a recovery .
in a joint declaration , the g8 nations and 15 visiting delegations from emerging economies attending the conference called on investors to improve access to energy in poor countries and develop new technologies to reduce emissions that cause climate change .
" we urge governments and energy companies to adopt a long-term view in planning their investments in energy infrastructure , " the ministers said in a closing statement .
investment , regulation needed to stabilize energy market the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said on monday that falling oil prices , tight credit markets and slumping demand had prompted oil producers to delay or scrap $ 170 billion worth of investments .
saudi arabia warned that oil prices could spike to beyond the near $ 150 record high of 2008 within three years , if there was not more investment to boost production over the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aging oil rigs need fresh capital in a speech distributed to the media , roberto poli , the ceo of italian energy group eni , said , " the persistence of high uncertainties related to oil prices up to $ 150 per barrel , or down to $ 30 , could upset the entire energy system , blocking investments both in traditional and alternative sources . "
in order to stabilize prices , poli urged governments to institute more regulation of oil financial markets , which he called " opaque and uncontrollable . "
the group of eight is looking for ways to ensure steady oil and gas supplies at reasonable prices , while allowing for moderate price increases to make it financially worthwhile for energy companies to explore for oil and gas deposits .
the energy meeting - which included the united states , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia - will present a draft energy strategy to a g8 leaders ' summit , scheduled for july in l 'aquila , italy. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

investment , regulation needed to stabilize energy market the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- said on monday that falling oil prices , tight credit markets and slumping demand had prompted oil producers to delay or scrap $ 170 billion worth of investments .
saudi arabia warned that oil prices could spike to beyond the near $ 150 record high of 2008 within three years , if there was not more investment to boost production over the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aging oil rigs need fresh capital in a speech distributed to the media , roberto poli , the ceo of italian energy group eni , said , " the persistence of high uncertainties related to oil prices up to $ 150 per barrel , or down to $ 30 , could upset the entire energy system , blocking investments both in traditional and alternative sources . "
in order to stabilize prices , poli urged governments to institute more regulation of oil financial markets , which he called " opaque and uncontrollable . "
the group of eight is looking for ways to ensure steady oil and gas supplies at reasonable prices , while allowing for moderate price increases to make it financially worthwhile for energy companies to explore for oil and gas deposits .
the energy meeting - which included the united states , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia - will present a draft energy strategy to a g8 leaders ' summit , scheduled for july in l 'aquila , italy. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in a new tack , borloo said countries such as the united states , which have said they can not implement such deep cuts by 2020 , could contribute to a new climate pact in other ways , for example by financing green technologies for developing nations .
this would give such nations the chance to catch up with emission reductions later on .
" there can be more flexibility among us , " borloo told the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in paris on monday .
" there may be some who act faster and others who do more later .
" there may be constraints on such and such a developed nation - but we must reach this 2020 objective of 25 to 40 percent , " he said .

any new pact would take effect after 2012 , when the current conventions under the kyoto protocol are due to expire .
" the world 's destiny will probably be at stake in copenhagen , " borloo said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 25.05.2009 international german archive recounts jazz ' turbulent history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american jazz traveled swiftly across the atlantic in the 20th century frowned upon and even banned under the nazi and communist regimes , jazz has had a rough time in 20th-century germany .
the international jazz archive in eisenach which documents it all is celebrating its 10th anniversary . it 's not beginning that 's rewarded , but persevering , said reinhard lorenz .
as one of the co-founders of the international jazz archive in eisenach , lorenz , the head of the town 's culture department , knows what he 's talking about : he 's helped develop the archive over the past decade . located just a few steps from the town center , the archive is located in the historic old malthouse .
downstairs in the vaulted cellar , live jazz is performed at club called " posaune " - or trombone . founded in 1959 , the jazz club has n't had an easy path , but without it , the archive would have been impossible .
eisenach is in what used to be east germany and , during the communist period , jazz was defamed because it came from the american " class enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive is housed in eisenach 's historic old malthouse but jazz fans in eisenach employed a small political trick to establish the " subversive " style of music - they said that jazz and folk were the voice of the american proletariat , which would have appealed to the communists . jewels of jazz " what there is to find under eisenach skies is unbelievable , " filmmaker wim wenders wrote in the guestbook at the international jazz archive while he was there doing research for his film " the soul of a man . " indeed , the archive is a treasure chest : 80,000 records and sound files , just as many photographs and negatives , 60,000 magazines , and numerous articles , posters , books , correspondence and films . the ground floor contains items that belonged to blues pianist guenter boas , who passed away in 1993 .
lorenz was fascinated by the man when he met him at a concert in former east germany . " guenter boas played with all the greats of this world - with armstrong , with fitzgerald and he corresponded with all the blues people , " said lorenz .
" we have over 1,000 letters here from his estate .
they 're music history treasures . " a life-size black-and-white picture of boas , hung over a leather sofa , greets visitors when they enter the archive . from the source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trevor richards entrusted what survived of his collection to the archive eisenach 's reputation for taking good care of jazz paraphernalia - a job done so far by volunteers - has reached all the way to new orleans . from what is considered to be the birthplace of jazz , percussionist trevor richards sent the archive a container full of records , books and percussion instruments .
a large part of his extensive collection had been damaged in hurricane katrina and what survived has been cleaned up and is now housed in eisenach . but in addition to the american articles , the archive also stays true to its local roots : a small museum portion informs visitors about jazz in former communist east germany with info boards and photographs . also in eisenach is the birth house of composer js bach has practically become a mecca for music lovers of all kinds and lorenz said he hopes the international jazz archive will soon become a significant center for jazz lovers and researchers alike . author : susanne von schenck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a 33-year-old german geophysicist , gerst will prepare to travel to space in september . deutsche welle : congratulations on being selected as one of the european space agency 's astronauts .
what was your first reaction when you got the news ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst said he is not afraid of being shot into space alexander gerst : it was the greatest feeling i could imagine at that time .
it was obviously a great dream of mine that i 'd had for most of my life that was fulfilled at that moment .
it 's hard to describe . you are basically living a dream ? yes , i was .
for me it is a long-standing dream to explore our planet and the space around it .
i was always a very curious person .
as a child i turned over every stone and looked behind every tree and i liked to explore .
for me now , after becoming a scientist , which allows me to do those things down here on earth , this new job offers me the chance to do the same in space which is the ultimate way for me to do science and exploration . thousands of people sent in applications to become one of europe 's astronauts .
how difficult was the selection process ? some of the tests were , obviously , quite tough - even for a successful candidate , they were n't easy at all .
i never went out of a test saying , " i 've got this one in the bag . "
i always came out with mixed feelings .
i said , " well , i did n't do so bad , but i also was n't really good at it . "
in the end it worked out , but it 's hard to tell .
some of the tests felt quite easy and natural and some others were very tough . what do you think it was that singled you out from the thousands of others during the grueling , year-long process for the role of european astronaut ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of training are necessary before stepping out into space i 'm actually not completely sure .
i think it might be a little of everything .
certainly there was some luck involved .
i considered myself lucky that my body was good enough to pass the medical test , which i 'm not fully responsible for . a very important component is fascination - fascination for the space program , fascination for the job .
that fascination leads to persistence to follow through with all the tests and all the preparations and to not give up on the way . another very important criterion is working in teams .
i 've shown through experiences i 've had in antarctica that i can perform in a team , and many others have done so as well , and i think that 's a very important criterion for the european space agency . you are a geophysicist , four of the other people chosen are pilots and the fifth works with guidance systems .
what role do you think your position as a scientist plays ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst conducted some of his research in antarctica every good team has to be a diverse one .
the charter of european astronauts says " unity through diversity , " and that 's the motto of all of europe in my opinion .
therefore , i think the european space agency did well by choosing a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences - only then can everyone contribute their experience to the bigger team experience . are you worried about what the future now holds for you ? i would n't call it worried , but it 's certainly a challenge .
i 've got a lot of press attention , but i do n't consider myself someone who has done a lot .
the european space agency puts a huge amount of trust in me and i do n't want to disappoint .
it 's a challenge and i 'm aware that i would like to perform as people expect . does the prospect of being strapped into a rocket and blasted into space frighten you ? no , not at all .
i 'm fascinated by that prospect . i do n't think fear is a helpful emotion in that respect .
i ca n't speak as an astronaut , of course , since i have n't flown yet , but as a scientist who has worked on active volcanoes i know that fear makes us irrational , which can sometimes be dangerous .

a 33-year-old german geophysicist , gerst will prepare to travel to space in september . deutsche welle : congratulations on being selected as one of the european space agency 's astronauts .
what was your first reaction when you got the news ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst said he is not afraid of being shot into space alexander gerst : it was the greatest feeling i could imagine at that time .
it was obviously a great dream of mine that i 'd had for most of my life that was fulfilled at that moment .
it 's hard to describe . you are basically living a dream ? yes , i was .
for me it is a long-standing dream to explore our planet and the space around it .
i was always a very curious person .
as a child i turned over every stone and looked behind every tree and i liked to explore .
for me now , after becoming a scientist , which allows me to do those things down here on earth , this new job offers me the chance to do the same in space which is the ultimate way for me to do science and exploration . thousands of people sent in applications to become one of europe 's astronauts .
how difficult was the selection process ? some of the tests were , obviously , quite tough - even for a successful candidate , they were n't easy at all .
i never went out of a test saying , " i 've got this one in the bag . "
i always came out with mixed feelings .
i said , " well , i did n't do so bad , but i also was n't really good at it . "
in the end it worked out , but it 's hard to tell .
some of the tests felt quite easy and natural and some others were very tough . what do you think it was that singled you out from the thousands of others during the grueling , year-long process for the role of european astronaut ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of training are necessary before stepping out into space i 'm actually not completely sure .
i think it might be a little of everything .
certainly there was some luck involved .
i considered myself lucky that my body was good enough to pass the medical test , which i 'm not fully responsible for . a very important component is fascination - fascination for the space program , fascination for the job .
that fascination leads to persistence to follow through with all the tests and all the preparations and to not give up on the way . another very important criterion is working in teams .
i 've shown through experiences i 've had in antarctica that i can perform in a team , and many others have done so as well , and i think that 's a very important criterion for the european space agency . you are a geophysicist , four of the other people chosen are pilots and the fifth works with guidance systems .
what role do you think your position as a scientist plays ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst conducted some of his research in antarctica every good team has to be a diverse one .
the charter of european astronauts says " unity through diversity , " and that 's the motto of all of europe in my opinion .
therefore , i think the european space agency did well by choosing a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences - only then can everyone contribute their experience to the bigger team experience . are you worried about what the future now holds for you ? i would n't call it worried , but it 's certainly a challenge .
i 've got a lot of press attention , but i do n't consider myself someone who has done a lot .
the european space agency puts a huge amount of trust in me and i do n't want to disappoint .
it 's a challenge and i 'm aware that i would like to perform as people expect . does the prospect of being strapped into a rocket and blasted into space frighten you ? no , not at all .
i 'm fascinated by that prospect . i do n't think fear is a helpful emotion in that respect .
i ca n't speak as an astronaut , of course , since i have n't flown yet , but as a scientist who has worked on active volcanoes i know that fear makes us irrational , which can sometimes be dangerous .
that is not a helpful feeling , but what is very important , at the same time , is to have respect for the risks involved - to minimize them and be aware of them .
so respect , yes , but fear , no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moon is a still a far-off goal for the new batch of future astronauts training for future missions to the international space station begins in september , and there is also a chance you could go to the moon in collaboration with nasa and other space agencies .

that fascination leads to persistence to follow through with all the tests and all the preparations and to not give up on the way . another very important criterion is working in teams .
i 've shown through experiences i 've had in antarctica that i can perform in a team , and many others have done so as well , and i think that 's a very important criterion for the european space agency . you are a geophysicist , four of the other people chosen are pilots and the fifth works with guidance systems .
what role do you think your position as a scientist plays ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst conducted some of his research in antarctica every good team has to be a diverse one .
the charter of european astronauts says " unity through diversity , " and that 's the motto of all of europe in my opinion .
therefore , i think the european space agency did well by choosing a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences - only then can everyone contribute their experience to the bigger team experience . are you worried about what the future now holds for you ? i would n't call it worried , but it 's certainly a challenge .
i 've got a lot of press attention , but i do n't consider myself someone who has done a lot .
the european space agency puts a huge amount of trust in me and i do n't want to disappoint .
it 's a challenge and i 'm aware that i would like to perform as people expect . does the prospect of being strapped into a rocket and blasted into space frighten you ? no , not at all .
i 'm fascinated by that prospect . i do n't think fear is a helpful emotion in that respect .
i ca n't speak as an astronaut , of course , since i have n't flown yet , but as a scientist who has worked on active volcanoes i know that fear makes us irrational , which can sometimes be dangerous .
that is not a helpful feeling , but what is very important , at the same time , is to have respect for the risks involved - to minimize them and be aware of them .
so respect , yes , but fear , no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moon is a still a far-off goal for the new batch of future astronauts training for future missions to the international space station begins in september , and there is also a chance you could go to the moon in collaboration with nasa and other space agencies .
what will you , personally , be looking forward to ? the moon program is quite far away , so i ca n't put myself in any role there because it 's certainly not clear who is going to be on that mission .
i would personally love to be there .
i know that the moon is full of treasures for us . i would rather concentrate now on closer things , like my training and , after that , flights to the international space station . there is a lot of science to be done there that is so important for us down here on earth .
in economic and scientific ways there is very important research to be done up there and that is what i would like to concentrate on most . interview : rajiv sharma -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in a new tack , borloo said countries such as the united states , which have said they can not implement such deep cuts by 2020 , could contribute to a new climate pact in other ways , for example by financing green technologies for developing nations .
this would give such nations the chance to catch up with emission reductions later on .
" there can be more flexibility among us , " borloo told the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in paris on monday .
" there may be some who act faster and others who do more later .
" there may be constraints on such and such a developed nation - but we must reach this 2020 objective of 25 to 40 percent , " he said .
finger pointing continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel says developing countries are still waiting for rich nations to act first developing nations led by china and india have accused rich nations of giving their economies greater priority than fighting climate change .
they charge that developed countries have not kept their promises to take the lead in cutting the burning of fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said , however , that developing countries were also not ready to commit to decreasing carbon emissions .
" the longer it takes for industrialized nations to have a common position , the longer we will have to wait until china and india move -lrb- on climate change -rrb- , " he said in paris .
copenhagen hopes the mef was called last month by us president barack obama .
it is the second of three preparatory gatherings ahead of another climate summit to be held in italy in july .
the role of the forums is to identify common ground between the world 's major emitters ahead of a major united nations climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
it is hoped that a new , planet-wide treaty regulating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can be agreed at the december meeting .
any new pact would take effect after 2012 , when the current conventions under the kyoto protocol are due to expire .
" the world 's destiny will probably be at stake in copenhagen , " borloo said .
" copenhagen is not a retrograde vision , it 's not the start of negative -lrb- economic -rrb- growth , but a new start for strong , sustainable , sober carbon development . "
us defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consensus is that time is running out for major polluters to ratify a new treaty a us congressional panel last week approved a bill that would cut us carbon emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 .
the european union , meanwhile , has pledged cuts of 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and 30 percent if other wealthy nations get on board .
despite the disparity , us officials maintain their country is pulling its weight .
" i do n't think it 's correct to say that europe is proposing a lot and the united states little , " todd stern , us special envoy for climate change , told tuesday 's edition of the french daily le monde .
" if you look at things from the point of view of the progress that each nation will have to make to reach its objectives , the us level of effort is probably equal , or superior , to that of europe , " stern added .
the paris mef is due to run until tuesday and will also focus on climate financing and the transfer of clean technologies. dfm / afpd / afpe / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.05.2009 voter apathy reflects lack of interest in eu affairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentary elections are a pretty dull affair the latest poll into who will vote in the upcoming european parliamentary elections on june 4-7 makes for some pretty grim reading .
it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink . a study carried out across the eu on behalf of the french political innovation foundation shows that 18 percent of those surveyed said they were ' not at all interested ' in the june poll , whilst 35 percent said they were ' rather not interested ' .
the same number said they were ' rather interested ' but only a meager 11 percent said they were ' very interested ' . the data coming in on voter apathy across the european union is turning unspoken but common knowledge into hard facts : the eu elections hold no interest for a huge number of the bloc 's citizens . what is less clear are the reasons why .
attempts have been made to connect the expected dramatically low turn-out with frustration over the incompetence of ministers , the mounting corruption scandals and the perceived idleness that voters associate with the overblown bureaucracy many believe the eu has become . but to equate the apparent refusal of so many europeans to head to the polls with an act of protest assumes that many people actually know or care what happens in brussels and strasbourg .
election experts believe it 's a lot simpler than that . " the european parliament is very important and the people who work there have an important role , but no-one has bothered to explain this to the voters , " professor mark franklin , chair of the european election studies steering group , told deutsche welle .
" it 's not clear what the european parliament does , it 's certainly not clear as to what difference it makes and it regularly throws up electoral lists full of unrecognizable names and faces .
it all adds up to the opinion that there 's no point to any of it . " boring election with no pay-off dr. hermann schmitt , project director at the mannheim center for european social research , told deutsche welle that he thought the lack of a tangible end product was turning voters off . " we know that people are disinterested , even to the degree that they don ’ t even know what 's going on , " he said .
" the main reason for this is that the european elections are seen to be quite unimportant .
this is because , in the european parliament election , the thing that characterizes a normal election is not going to happen – that is , a government is not going to be formed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are not immune from election lethargy " it 's not that people are staying away from these elections because they are critical of the european union and its political process ; it 's just that these elections are so boring and one does n't know why one should participate because not much is going to happen as a result of it , " he added . european parliamentary election turnout has fallen steadily from 66 percent in 1979 to just over 45 percent in 2004 , and in most member states is amongst the lowest for any form of poll . professor franklin is not surprised at all by the predicted voting figures .
he is , if anything , surprised that so many are saying that they intend to take part in this election . " the most amazing thing is that anyone votes at all , " he said .
" why would anyone vote in an election where they have no idea what 's at stake , what the issues are and what , if any , difference the election will have on their lives ?
that ’ s the case with all european elections . " three voting groups make up the numbers franklin believes that those who will vote will come from three groups which can always be relied upon to take part in elections .
these groups vote out of loyalty , habit or just because they want a change of pace . bildunterschrift : the greens traditionally benefit from expressive votes " we have the party loyalists who react to calls from their leaders to vote and save their party humiliation ; then there are those who vote out of habit , who generally believe that voting is a good thing and that they should exercise that right to vote , and then there are the expressive voters who tend to vote for parties , such as the greens , for whom they would n't normally vote in national elections , " he said . " these expressive votes usually come about because the voters know that it doesn ’ t matter who they vote for , because they think it wo n't matter anyway , it just gives them a chance to support someone different . " while eurocrats may be worried about keeping their jobs , a more serious concern is that the expected low turn-out could have unpleasant consequences for the make-up of the future parliament and the political spectrum in europe . lower turn-out plays into extremist hands the lower the turnout , the easier it will be for more radical parties to do well .
as in the 1930s , rising extremism is seen as a key potential risk from the financial crisis and resulting rise in unemployment and hardship . that could potentially see a rise both for far-left parties and right-wingers , including those angry at rising immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's extremist bnp could benefit from voter apathy anti-foreigner rhetoric , and in some cases violence , have increased in several countries in recent months .
analysts are watching the potential rise of the far-right in hungary and the nationalist british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , amongst others . " a low turn-out would certainly have implications in terms of niche or radical fringe parties , " professor franklin said .
" this is where the expressive voters come in .
they may make a choice to vote for a far-right or far-left party because of the reasons i gave before , that they believe that it wo n't make a difference .
they wouldn ’ t do this in national elections because it may have an impact , but in europe – who cares ? " what could happen , though , is that these extremist parties , for example an anti-eu party , may take seats away from others and then make the passing of legislation almost impossible , freezing the political process , " he added . franklin also believes that politics on a national level may suffer across europe as a result . eu elections could color the national voting experience " this european election experience may be the first time that around 50 percent of voters in the eu vote for the first time , " he said .
" if this is their first experience of an electoral vote , imagine what that can do to their opinion of the democratic process !

it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink . a study carried out across the eu on behalf of the french political innovation foundation shows that 18 percent of those surveyed said they were ' not at all interested ' in the june poll , whilst 35 percent said they were ' rather not interested ' .
the same number said they were ' rather interested ' but only a meager 11 percent said they were ' very interested ' . the data coming in on voter apathy across the european union is turning unspoken but common knowledge into hard facts : the eu elections hold no interest for a huge number of the bloc 's citizens . what is less clear are the reasons why .
attempts have been made to connect the expected dramatically low turn-out with frustration over the incompetence of ministers , the mounting corruption scandals and the perceived idleness that voters associate with the overblown bureaucracy many believe the eu has become . but to equate the apparent refusal of so many europeans to head to the polls with an act of protest assumes that many people actually know or care what happens in brussels and strasbourg .
election experts believe it 's a lot simpler than that . " the european parliament is very important and the people who work there have an important role , but no-one has bothered to explain this to the voters , " professor mark franklin , chair of the european election studies steering group , told deutsche welle .
" it 's not clear what the european parliament does , it 's certainly not clear as to what difference it makes and it regularly throws up electoral lists full of unrecognizable names and faces .
it all adds up to the opinion that there 's no point to any of it . " boring election with no pay-off dr. hermann schmitt , project director at the mannheim center for european social research , told deutsche welle that he thought the lack of a tangible end product was turning voters off . " we know that people are disinterested , even to the degree that they don ’ t even know what 's going on , " he said .
" the main reason for this is that the european elections are seen to be quite unimportant .
this is because , in the european parliament election , the thing that characterizes a normal election is not going to happen – that is , a government is not going to be formed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are not immune from election lethargy " it 's not that people are staying away from these elections because they are critical of the european union and its political process ; it 's just that these elections are so boring and one does n't know why one should participate because not much is going to happen as a result of it , " he added . european parliamentary election turnout has fallen steadily from 66 percent in 1979 to just over 45 percent in 2004 , and in most member states is amongst the lowest for any form of poll . professor franklin is not surprised at all by the predicted voting figures .
he is , if anything , surprised that so many are saying that they intend to take part in this election . " the most amazing thing is that anyone votes at all , " he said .
" why would anyone vote in an election where they have no idea what 's at stake , what the issues are and what , if any , difference the election will have on their lives ?
that ’ s the case with all european elections . " three voting groups make up the numbers franklin believes that those who will vote will come from three groups which can always be relied upon to take part in elections .
these groups vote out of loyalty , habit or just because they want a change of pace . bildunterschrift : the greens traditionally benefit from expressive votes " we have the party loyalists who react to calls from their leaders to vote and save their party humiliation ; then there are those who vote out of habit , who generally believe that voting is a good thing and that they should exercise that right to vote , and then there are the expressive voters who tend to vote for parties , such as the greens , for whom they would n't normally vote in national elections , " he said . " these expressive votes usually come about because the voters know that it doesn ’ t matter who they vote for , because they think it wo n't matter anyway , it just gives them a chance to support someone different . " while eurocrats may be worried about keeping their jobs , a more serious concern is that the expected low turn-out could have unpleasant consequences for the make-up of the future parliament and the political spectrum in europe . lower turn-out plays into extremist hands the lower the turnout , the easier it will be for more radical parties to do well .
as in the 1930s , rising extremism is seen as a key potential risk from the financial crisis and resulting rise in unemployment and hardship . that could potentially see a rise both for far-left parties and right-wingers , including those angry at rising immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's extremist bnp could benefit from voter apathy anti-foreigner rhetoric , and in some cases violence , have increased in several countries in recent months .
analysts are watching the potential rise of the far-right in hungary and the nationalist british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , amongst others . " a low turn-out would certainly have implications in terms of niche or radical fringe parties , " professor franklin said .
" this is where the expressive voters come in .
they may make a choice to vote for a far-right or far-left party because of the reasons i gave before , that they believe that it wo n't make a difference .
they wouldn ’ t do this in national elections because it may have an impact , but in europe – who cares ? " what could happen , though , is that these extremist parties , for example an anti-eu party , may take seats away from others and then make the passing of legislation almost impossible , freezing the political process , " he added . franklin also believes that politics on a national level may suffer across europe as a result . eu elections could color the national voting experience " this european election experience may be the first time that around 50 percent of voters in the eu vote for the first time , " he said .
" if this is their first experience of an electoral vote , imagine what that can do to their opinion of the democratic process !
the next time there 's a national vote , the domestic parties may say , ' those eu elections were n't that important but these ones are ' – but by then an opinion is already starting to form that all elections are pointless , especially among young voters .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign fight involving barroso might excite voters both franklin and schmitt say that a change in the process where electable figureheads are campaigning for office – be it the president of the commission or a future european president – could help encourage people to vote in european elections . " if the parliament would elect the president of the commission and two or three competing candidates would run in these elections , things would be different and turn-out would increase , " schmitt said .
" elections are about horse races , elections are about who is going to govern , elections are about people and faces and whether you like them or you do n't . " a real race - but who would want to run ? " to make the european elections more attractive , the process could include a number of presidential candidates who are running against each other , " franklin said .
" then there will be other politicians who will stand and say ' i support such and such because of this and that ' .
we might then get a debate about what these people intend to do .
it will be a real election with electable faces and personalities . " however , franklin believes that turning european elections into a sexy presidential race will probably not happen any time soon . " someone once said that electing a european president would relegate people , like the president of france , into a role no more important than the governor of texas , " he said .
" real elections for a european president would make national leaders even less relevant , and which politician would want that ? " author : nick amies editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.05.2009 france , germany push for more flexible climate pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any new climate deal must be flexible , france and germany say rich nations should collectively sign up to carbon emission cuts of up to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , germany and france told ministers from nations accounting for around 80 percent of global carbon emissions . french environment minister jean-louis borloo told the gathering of 17 top greenhouse gas emitters including china , the us , russia and india that developed nations should aim for cuts of between 25 and 40 percent .
but in a new tack , borloo said countries such as the united states , which have said they can not implement such deep cuts by 2020 , could contribute to a new climate pact in other ways , for example by financing green technologies for developing nations .
this would give such nations the chance to catch up with emission reductions later on .
" there can be more flexibility among us , " borloo told the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in paris on monday .
" there may be some who act faster and others who do more later .
" there may be constraints on such and such a developed nation - but we must reach this 2020 objective of 25 to 40 percent , " he said .
finger pointing continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel says developing countries are still waiting for rich nations to act first developing nations led by china and india have accused rich nations of giving their economies greater priority than fighting climate change .
they charge that developed countries have not kept their promises to take the lead in cutting the burning of fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said , however , that developing countries were also not ready to commit to decreasing carbon emissions .
" the longer it takes for industrialized nations to have a common position , the longer we will have to wait until china and india move -lrb- on climate change -rrb- , " he said in paris .
copenhagen hopes the mef was called last month by us president barack obama .
it is the second of three preparatory gatherings ahead of another climate summit to be held in italy in july .
the role of the forums is to identify common ground between the world 's major emitters ahead of a major united nations climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
it is hoped that a new , planet-wide treaty regulating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can be agreed at the december meeting .
any new pact would take effect after 2012 , when the current conventions under the kyoto protocol are due to expire .
" the world 's destiny will probably be at stake in copenhagen , " borloo said .
" copenhagen is not a retrograde vision , it 's not the start of negative -lrb- economic -rrb- growth , but a new start for strong , sustainable , sober carbon development . "
us defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consensus is that time is running out for major polluters to ratify a new treaty a us congressional panel last week approved a bill that would cut us carbon emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 .
the european union , meanwhile , has pledged cuts of 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and 30 percent if other wealthy nations get on board .
despite the disparity , us officials maintain their country is pulling its weight .
" i do n't think it 's correct to say that europe is proposing a lot and the united states little , " todd stern , us special envoy for climate change , told tuesday 's edition of the french daily le monde .
" if you look at things from the point of view of the progress that each nation will have to make to reach its objectives , the us level of effort is probably equal , or superior , to that of europe , " stern added .
the paris mef is due to run until tuesday and will also focus on climate financing and the transfer of clean technologies. dfm / afpd / afpe / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet rtl has said it will do no such thing and intends to air the first episode on june 3 as planned .
the show follows four teenage couples who have said they want to become parents .
the teenagers are given a borrowed baby to care for over several days and tv crews document their struggles to change diapers and quiet temper tantrums .
the show poses the question : are these teenagers really ready to take on parenthood ?
children " at risk " criticism from child advocates has been building in recent weeks .

german child advocates say the show exploits the young children who are being loaned out to inexperienced teenagers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen says the show could harm the children involved “ one asks oneself the entire time : what about the children ?
where are their rights ? ” von der leyen told spiegel magazine .
the german parliament 's commission for children issued a statement in which it chastised rtl for using children as guinea pigs and for “ exploiting children in an irresponsible manner . ”
the commission urged rtl not to air the series .
germany 's federation for the protection of children has also weighed in , saying it is " furious " at the concept , which it claims puts children at " high risk . "
the show has cleared all necessary regulatory hurdles .
rtl has pointed out that the babies are monitored around the clock by child psychologists and doctors to ensure that the inexperienced caregivers do no harm and that the parents are also just off camera .
“ we have kept the well-being of the children , couples and parents who are participating in mind as well as the effect on our viewers , ” rtl ceo anke schaeferkordt said .
“ we have taken our responsibility very seriously . ”
teen pregnancy in the spotlight in response to recent criticism , rtl published an interview with one mother , identified as katrin , who lent her 10-month-old son lasse to the program .
the woman said she did not fear for her son 's safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show 's planners say they intend to spark a discussion about teen pregnancy “ the trial parents managed very well , lasse managed very well and there was always a pediatrician or someone else nearby … lasse had so much fun during the project , ” the mother said .
rtl views the show , which is an adaptation of the bbc 's " the baby borrowers " , as helping to usher in an important discussion over teen pregnancy .
von der leyen dismissed this rationale , saying that teen pregnancy is a topic well covered by german schools .
she told spiegel that , while teenage pregnancy is a pressing issue in the uk , it is much less of a problem in germany .
according to unicef statistics , german teenagers account for 13 out of each 1,000 births .
in comparison , british teenagers account for 30 of 1,000 births and the united states has 52 per 1,000 births. th / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a 33-year-old german geophysicist , gerst will prepare to travel to space in september . deutsche welle : congratulations on being selected as one of the european space agency 's astronauts .
what was your first reaction when you got the news ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst said he is not afraid of being shot into space alexander gerst : it was the greatest feeling i could imagine at that time .
it was obviously a great dream of mine that i 'd had for most of my life that was fulfilled at that moment .
it 's hard to describe . you are basically living a dream ? yes , i was .
for me it is a long-standing dream to explore our planet and the space around it .
i was always a very curious person .
as a child i turned over every stone and looked behind every tree and i liked to explore .
for me now , after becoming a scientist , which allows me to do those things down here on earth , this new job offers me the chance to do the same in space which is the ultimate way for me to do science and exploration . thousands of people sent in applications to become one of europe 's astronauts .
how difficult was the selection process ? some of the tests were , obviously , quite tough - even for a successful candidate , they were n't easy at all .
i never went out of a test saying , " i 've got this one in the bag . "
i always came out with mixed feelings .
i said , " well , i did n't do so bad , but i also was n't really good at it . "
in the end it worked out , but it 's hard to tell .
some of the tests felt quite easy and natural and some others were very tough . what do you think it was that singled you out from the thousands of others during the grueling , year-long process for the role of european astronaut ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of training are necessary before stepping out into space i 'm actually not completely sure .
i think it might be a little of everything .
certainly there was some luck involved .
i considered myself lucky that my body was good enough to pass the medical test , which i 'm not fully responsible for . a very important component is fascination - fascination for the space program , fascination for the job .
that fascination leads to persistence to follow through with all the tests and all the preparations and to not give up on the way . another very important criterion is working in teams .
i 've shown through experiences i 've had in antarctica that i can perform in a team , and many others have done so as well , and i think that 's a very important criterion for the european space agency . you are a geophysicist , four of the other people chosen are pilots and the fifth works with guidance systems .
what role do you think your position as a scientist plays ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst conducted some of his research in antarctica every good team has to be a diverse one .
the charter of european astronauts says " unity through diversity , " and that 's the motto of all of europe in my opinion .
therefore , i think the european space agency did well by choosing a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences - only then can everyone contribute their experience to the bigger team experience . are you worried about what the future now holds for you ? i would n't call it worried , but it 's certainly a challenge .
i 've got a lot of press attention , but i do n't consider myself someone who has done a lot .
the european space agency puts a huge amount of trust in me and i do n't want to disappoint .
it 's a challenge and i 'm aware that i would like to perform as people expect . does the prospect of being strapped into a rocket and blasted into space frighten you ? no , not at all .
i 'm fascinated by that prospect . i do n't think fear is a helpful emotion in that respect .
i ca n't speak as an astronaut , of course , since i have n't flown yet , but as a scientist who has worked on active volcanoes i know that fear makes us irrational , which can sometimes be dangerous .
that is not a helpful feeling , but what is very important , at the same time , is to have respect for the risks involved - to minimize them and be aware of them .
so respect , yes , but fear , no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moon is a still a far-off goal for the new batch of future astronauts training for future missions to the international space station begins in september , and there is also a chance you could go to the moon in collaboration with nasa and other space agencies .
what will you , personally , be looking forward to ? the moon program is quite far away , so i ca n't put myself in any role there because it 's certainly not clear who is going to be on that mission .
i would personally love to be there .
i know that the moon is full of treasures for us . i would rather concentrate now on closer things , like my training and , after that , flights to the international space station . there is a lot of science to be done there that is so important for us down here on earth .
in economic and scientific ways there is very important research to be done up there and that is what i would like to concentrate on most . interview : rajiv sharma -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the north conducted the test early on monday , detonating a bomb some 10 kilometers underground in the same area where it conducted an initial nuclear test in october , 2006 .
pyongyang test-fired three short-range , ground-to-air missiles later on monday from the site from which it launched a rocket last month , a south korean news agency reported , citing unnamed sources .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , condemned the test , saying it further threatened peace and security in northeast asia .
" these irresponsible acts by north korea warrant a firm response by the international community .
the european union will be in contact with its partners to discuss appropriate measures , " solana said in a statement .
the czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he was " very much disturbed " by north korea 's announcement that it had " successfully " carried out a nuclear test .
british prime minister gordon brown described the decision to carry out the tests as " erroneous , misguided and a danger to the world " .
" this act will undermine prospects for peace on the korean peninsula and will do nothing for north korea 's security .
the international community will treat north korea as a partner if it behaves responsibly .
if it does not then it can expect only renewed isolation , " brown said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans have demanded that north korea 's kim jong il step down asian neighbors condemn test reactions to the test in asia were also swift .
in south korea , president lee myung-bak has called an emergency meeting of the country 's security council , and in japan officials have set up a task force in the crisis management center of prime minister taro aso 's office .
" it is an act that we can never tolerate , " japanese foreign minister hirofumi nakasone said in hanoi on the sidelines of talks between asian and european ministers .
" as it is a violation of un security council resolutions , japan condemns and protests it strongly .
we , as the only nation to have had a nuclear bomb used against us , feel the need to take stern action . "
second test “ much more ” powerful the united states geological survey -lrb- usgs -rrb- initially reported that it had detected a 4.5-magnitude earthquake in the northeast of north korea . ´ the north korean central news agency confirmed the test shortly after the usgs registered the quake .
the force of the blast was reported to be between 10 and 20 kilotons , a size comparable to that of the atomic bomb explosions in nagasaki and hiroshima at the close of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : monday 's underground blast was as powerful as the atomic bomb the us dropped on hiroshima this second north korean nuclear test was much more powerful than the first in 2006 , which registered a force not greater than one kiloton .
the north vows to continue tests " the test will contribute to safeguarding our sovereignty and socialism and guaranteeing peace and safety on the korean peninsula and the surrounding region . " said the statement from north korea 's official news agency .
a senior official at pyongyang 's embassy in moscow told the itar-tass news agency on monday that north korea will continue to carry out nuclear tests until western nations , led by the united states , bring an end to policies of " intimidation .

the north conducted the test early on monday , detonating a bomb some 10 kilometers underground in the same area where it conducted an initial nuclear test in october , 2006 .
pyongyang test-fired three short-range , ground-to-air missiles later on monday from the site from which it launched a rocket last month , a south korean news agency reported , citing unnamed sources .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , condemned the test , saying it further threatened peace and security in northeast asia .
" these irresponsible acts by north korea warrant a firm response by the international community .
the european union will be in contact with its partners to discuss appropriate measures , " solana said in a statement .
the czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he was " very much disturbed " by north korea 's announcement that it had " successfully " carried out a nuclear test .
british prime minister gordon brown described the decision to carry out the tests as " erroneous , misguided and a danger to the world " .
" this act will undermine prospects for peace on the korean peninsula and will do nothing for north korea 's security .
the international community will treat north korea as a partner if it behaves responsibly .

the international community will treat north korea as a partner if it behaves responsibly .
if it does not then it can expect only renewed isolation , " brown said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans have demanded that north korea 's kim jong il step down asian neighbors condemn test reactions to the test in asia were also swift .
in south korea , president lee myung-bak has called an emergency meeting of the country 's security council , and in japan officials have set up a task force in the crisis management center of prime minister taro aso 's office .
" it is an act that we can never tolerate , " japanese foreign minister hirofumi nakasone said in hanoi on the sidelines of talks between asian and european ministers .
" as it is a violation of un security council resolutions , japan condemns and protests it strongly .
we , as the only nation to have had a nuclear bomb used against us , feel the need to take stern action . "
second test “ much more ” powerful the united states geological survey -lrb- usgs -rrb- initially reported that it had detected a 4.5-magnitude earthquake in the northeast of north korea . ´ the north korean central news agency confirmed the test shortly after the usgs registered the quake .
the force of the blast was reported to be between 10 and 20 kilotons , a size comparable to that of the atomic bomb explosions in nagasaki and hiroshima at the close of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : monday 's underground blast was as powerful as the atomic bomb the us dropped on hiroshima this second north korean nuclear test was much more powerful than the first in 2006 , which registered a force not greater than one kiloton .
the north vows to continue tests " the test will contribute to safeguarding our sovereignty and socialism and guaranteeing peace and safety on the korean peninsula and the surrounding region . " said the statement from north korea 's official news agency .
a senior official at pyongyang 's embassy in moscow told the itar-tass news agency on monday that north korea will continue to carry out nuclear tests until western nations , led by the united states , bring an end to policies of " intimidation .

ministers meeting in brussels on monday also adopted a set of common standards and sanctions against employers who hire illegal foreign immigrants .
these include making it mandatory for businesses to ensure that non-eu workers hold a valid residence permit and that a copy of such permits be kept on record should inspectors demand to see it .
eu-wide penalties would consist of fines , which would increase according to the number of illegally employed foreigners , and the possible exclusion of guilty businesses from accessing public funds or taking part in public tenders .
new rules designed to end abuses on the other hand , signing up to the blue card scheme would give foreign workers limited social welfare rights and benefits , and allow them to bring in their families while they work in an eu country .
the new rules are designed to end abuses by unscrupulous employers who hire illegal immigrants and then pay them sub-standard wages under poor working conditions .
the european commission 's far more ambitious initial proposal was watered down significantly by national governments , which insisted that it should be up to them to decide how many migrants should enter their countries and what qualifications eligible workers should have .
three eu members - britain , ireland and denmark - are not participating in the blue card program , preferring instead to set their own guidelines. gb / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the parent company of troubled german department store karstadt is warning that it could go bankrupt if the government does n't provide aid .
but competitors say such a move would be unfair . arcandor has stepped up pressure on the german government to lend it a helping hand .
in interviews over the weekend , the heads of arcandor and its karstadt department store unit warned that without taxpayer assistance to the tune of 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- some 50,000 jobs would be threatened .
arcandor runs not only the karstadt department store chain , but also the mail-order retailer quelle and the thomas cook travel company .
bankruptcy threat " there is no private economic solution .
there is no alternative to state aid , " arcandor ceo karl-gerhard eick told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
he repeated his demand for 650 million euros in loan guarantees and a 200-million-euro credit in saturday 's edition of the bild newspaper .
" without guarantees we have to find a new route , and that could include bankruptcy , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt rejects the idea of a kaufhof merger meanwhile , karstadt ceo stefan herzberg told the sunday edition of bild : " the lives of more than 50,000 workers could be disrupted . "
furthermore , he warned , a bankruptcy could have an effect on suppliers and ulitmately it could be " a catastrophe for germany 's downtown shopping zones . "
cool response from politicians so far , politicians appear to be unmoved by the threats .
to date , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has reacted cautiously to the arcandor warnings .
and volker kauder , a leading member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , rejected the notion of state aid for karstadt , noting that the firm was already in trouble before the current banking crisis began .
furthermore , one of arcandor 's competitors , tengelmann , has loudly rejected the company 's bid for public funding .
in an interview with wirtschaftswoche magazine , tengelmann ceo karl-erivan haub said state aid for karstadt " would be a slap in the face for all the companies that had done a good management job " in the past .
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung newspaper has also raised the question of whether karstadt is n't simply stuck in financial turmoil of its own making .
the paper said suppliers had already recalled wares due to lack of payment , and that employee pay is only secured through may .
retailers suffering arcandor 's eick also rejected the idea of a recently discussed merger between karstadt and kaufhof , germany 's other major department store , saying it would be insufficient to prevent the collapse of arcandor .
the merger is merely a poorly disguised attempt by kaufhof to drive karstadt into bankruptcy and to pick off individual karstadt department stores , according to eick .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.05.2009 voter apathy reflects lack of interest in eu affairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentary elections are a pretty dull affair the latest poll into who will vote in the upcoming european parliamentary elections on june 4-7 makes for some pretty grim reading .
it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink . a study carried out across the eu on behalf of the french political innovation foundation shows that 18 percent of those surveyed said they were ' not at all interested ' in the june poll , whilst 35 percent said they were ' rather not interested ' .
the same number said they were ' rather interested ' but only a meager 11 percent said they were ' very interested ' . the data coming in on voter apathy across the european union is turning unspoken but common knowledge into hard facts : the eu elections hold no interest for a huge number of the bloc 's citizens . what is less clear are the reasons why .
attempts have been made to connect the expected dramatically low turn-out with frustration over the incompetence of ministers , the mounting corruption scandals and the perceived idleness that voters associate with the overblown bureaucracy many believe the eu has become . but to equate the apparent refusal of so many europeans to head to the polls with an act of protest assumes that many people actually know or care what happens in brussels and strasbourg .
election experts believe it 's a lot simpler than that . " the european parliament is very important and the people who work there have an important role , but no-one has bothered to explain this to the voters , " professor mark franklin , chair of the european election studies steering group , told deutsche welle .
" it 's not clear what the european parliament does , it 's certainly not clear as to what difference it makes and it regularly throws up electoral lists full of unrecognizable names and faces .
it all adds up to the opinion that there 's no point to any of it . " boring election with no pay-off dr. hermann schmitt , project director at the mannheim center for european social research , told deutsche welle that he thought the lack of a tangible end product was turning voters off . " we know that people are disinterested , even to the degree that they don ’ t even know what 's going on , " he said .
" the main reason for this is that the european elections are seen to be quite unimportant .
this is because , in the european parliament election , the thing that characterizes a normal election is not going to happen – that is , a government is not going to be formed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are not immune from election lethargy " it 's not that people are staying away from these elections because they are critical of the european union and its political process ; it 's just that these elections are so boring and one does n't know why one should participate because not much is going to happen as a result of it , " he added . european parliamentary election turnout has fallen steadily from 66 percent in 1979 to just over 45 percent in 2004 , and in most member states is amongst the lowest for any form of poll . professor franklin is not surprised at all by the predicted voting figures .
he is , if anything , surprised that so many are saying that they intend to take part in this election . " the most amazing thing is that anyone votes at all , " he said .
" why would anyone vote in an election where they have no idea what 's at stake , what the issues are and what , if any , difference the election will have on their lives ?
that ’ s the case with all european elections . " three voting groups make up the numbers franklin believes that those who will vote will come from three groups which can always be relied upon to take part in elections .
these groups vote out of loyalty , habit or just because they want a change of pace . bildunterschrift : the greens traditionally benefit from expressive votes " we have the party loyalists who react to calls from their leaders to vote and save their party humiliation ; then there are those who vote out of habit , who generally believe that voting is a good thing and that they should exercise that right to vote , and then there are the expressive voters who tend to vote for parties , such as the greens , for whom they would n't normally vote in national elections , " he said . " these expressive votes usually come about because the voters know that it doesn ’ t matter who they vote for , because they think it wo n't matter anyway , it just gives them a chance to support someone different . " while eurocrats may be worried about keeping their jobs , a more serious concern is that the expected low turn-out could have unpleasant consequences for the make-up of the future parliament and the political spectrum in europe . lower turn-out plays into extremist hands the lower the turnout , the easier it will be for more radical parties to do well .
as in the 1930s , rising extremism is seen as a key potential risk from the financial crisis and resulting rise in unemployment and hardship . that could potentially see a rise both for far-left parties and right-wingers , including those angry at rising immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's extremist bnp could benefit from voter apathy anti-foreigner rhetoric , and in some cases violence , have increased in several countries in recent months .
analysts are watching the potential rise of the far-right in hungary and the nationalist british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , amongst others . " a low turn-out would certainly have implications in terms of niche or radical fringe parties , " professor franklin said .
" this is where the expressive voters come in .
they may make a choice to vote for a far-right or far-left party because of the reasons i gave before , that they believe that it wo n't make a difference .
they wouldn ’ t do this in national elections because it may have an impact , but in europe – who cares ? " what could happen , though , is that these extremist parties , for example an anti-eu party , may take seats away from others and then make the passing of legislation almost impossible , freezing the political process , " he added . franklin also believes that politics on a national level may suffer across europe as a result . eu elections could color the national voting experience " this european election experience may be the first time that around 50 percent of voters in the eu vote for the first time , " he said .
" if this is their first experience of an electoral vote , imagine what that can do to their opinion of the democratic process !
the next time there 's a national vote , the domestic parties may say , ' those eu elections were n't that important but these ones are ' – but by then an opinion is already starting to form that all elections are pointless , especially among young voters .
this is one of the reasons why national turn-outs are also on the wane across europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign fight involving barroso might excite voters both franklin and schmitt say that a change in the process where electable figureheads are campaigning for office – be it the president of the commission or a future european president – could help encourage people to vote in european elections . " if the parliament would elect the president of the commission and two or three competing candidates would run in these elections , things would be different and turn-out would increase , " schmitt said .
" elections are about horse races , elections are about who is going to govern , elections are about people and faces and whether you like them or you do n't . " a real race - but who would want to run ? " to make the european elections more attractive , the process could include a number of presidential candidates who are running against each other , " franklin said .
" then there will be other politicians who will stand and say ' i support such and such because of this and that ' .
we might then get a debate about what these people intend to do .
it will be a real election with electable faces and personalities . " however , franklin believes that turning european elections into a sexy presidential race will probably not happen any time soon . " someone once said that electing a european president would relegate people , like the president of france , into a role no more important than the governor of texas , " he said .
" real elections for a european president would make national leaders even less relevant , and which politician would want that ? " author : nick amies editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ministers meeting in brussels on monday also adopted a set of common standards and sanctions against employers who hire illegal foreign immigrants .
these include making it mandatory for businesses to ensure that non-eu workers hold a valid residence permit and that a copy of such permits be kept on record should inspectors demand to see it .
eu-wide penalties would consist of fines , which would increase according to the number of illegally employed foreigners , and the possible exclusion of guilty businesses from accessing public funds or taking part in public tenders .
new rules designed to end abuses on the other hand , signing up to the blue card scheme would give foreign workers limited social welfare rights and benefits , and allow them to bring in their families while they work in an eu country .
the new rules are designed to end abuses by unscrupulous employers who hire illegal immigrants and then pay them sub-standard wages under poor working conditions .
the european commission 's far more ambitious initial proposal was watered down significantly by national governments , which insisted that it should be up to them to decide how many migrants should enter their countries and what qualifications eligible workers should have .
three eu members - britain , ireland and denmark - are not participating in the blue card program , preferring instead to set their own guidelines. gb / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 25.05.2009 international german archive recounts jazz ' turbulent history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american jazz traveled swiftly across the atlantic in the 20th century frowned upon and even banned under the nazi and communist regimes , jazz has had a rough time in 20th-century germany .
the international jazz archive in eisenach which documents it all is celebrating its 10th anniversary . it 's not beginning that 's rewarded , but persevering , said reinhard lorenz .
as one of the co-founders of the international jazz archive in eisenach , lorenz , the head of the town 's culture department , knows what he 's talking about : he 's helped develop the archive over the past decade . located just a few steps from the town center , the archive is located in the historic old malthouse .
downstairs in the vaulted cellar , live jazz is performed at club called " posaune " - or trombone . founded in 1959 , the jazz club has n't had an easy path , but without it , the archive would have been impossible .
eisenach is in what used to be east germany and , during the communist period , jazz was defamed because it came from the american " class enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive is housed in eisenach 's historic old malthouse but jazz fans in eisenach employed a small political trick to establish the " subversive " style of music - they said that jazz and folk were the voice of the american proletariat , which would have appealed to the communists . jewels of jazz " what there is to find under eisenach skies is unbelievable , " filmmaker wim wenders wrote in the guestbook at the international jazz archive while he was there doing research for his film " the soul of a man . " indeed , the archive is a treasure chest : 80,000 records and sound files , just as many photographs and negatives , 60,000 magazines , and numerous articles , posters , books , correspondence and films . the ground floor contains items that belonged to blues pianist guenter boas , who passed away in 1993 .
lorenz was fascinated by the man when he met him at a concert in former east germany . " guenter boas played with all the greats of this world - with armstrong , with fitzgerald and he corresponded with all the blues people , " said lorenz .
" we have over 1,000 letters here from his estate .
they 're music history treasures . " a life-size black-and-white picture of boas , hung over a leather sofa , greets visitors when they enter the archive . from the source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trevor richards entrusted what survived of his collection to the archive eisenach 's reputation for taking good care of jazz paraphernalia - a job done so far by volunteers - has reached all the way to new orleans . from what is considered to be the birthplace of jazz , percussionist trevor richards sent the archive a container full of records , books and percussion instruments .
a large part of his extensive collection had been damaged in hurricane katrina and what survived has been cleaned up and is now housed in eisenach . but in addition to the american articles , the archive also stays true to its local roots : a small museum portion informs visitors about jazz in former communist east germany with info boards and photographs . also in eisenach is the birth house of composer js bach has practically become a mecca for music lovers of all kinds and lorenz said he hopes the international jazz archive will soon become a significant center for jazz lovers and researchers alike . author : susanne von schenck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german business confidence rose in may for the second time in a row .
but observers say that the increase was less than forecast , and that the recession is far from over in germany . the munich-based ifo research institute said its closely-watched business-confidence index climbed to 84.2 points from 83.7 points in april .
this was the second increase in a row for the poll of 7,000 business leaders . but a reuters poll showed respondents had expected the index to increase to 85 points , and so reaction to the news was mixed .
mixed signal economists take the ifo reading as a serious measure of germany 's economic outlook .
some read the poll as a sign of a rosy future .
analyst joerg kraemer from commerzbank told reuters the measure was a " further clear signal that the plunging german economy is a thing of the past .
the recession is losing speed , and could be over by the autumn . "
' anemic ' improvement still , he warned that the coming improvements should n't be overestimated .
any improvements after that will be " anemic . "
other analysts saw the data in a less positive light .
despite the general improvement in sentiment , leading economic forecasters see germany facing six percent contraction in its economy this year , which is likely to trigger an increase in unemployment. jen / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a 33-year-old german geophysicist , gerst will prepare to travel to space in september . deutsche welle : congratulations on being selected as one of the european space agency 's astronauts .
what was your first reaction when you got the news ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst said he is not afraid of being shot into space alexander gerst : it was the greatest feeling i could imagine at that time .
it was obviously a great dream of mine that i 'd had for most of my life that was fulfilled at that moment .
it 's hard to describe . you are basically living a dream ? yes , i was .
for me it is a long-standing dream to explore our planet and the space around it .
i was always a very curious person .
as a child i turned over every stone and looked behind every tree and i liked to explore .
for me now , after becoming a scientist , which allows me to do those things down here on earth , this new job offers me the chance to do the same in space which is the ultimate way for me to do science and exploration . thousands of people sent in applications to become one of europe 's astronauts .
how difficult was the selection process ? some of the tests were , obviously , quite tough - even for a successful candidate , they were n't easy at all .
i never went out of a test saying , " i 've got this one in the bag . "
i always came out with mixed feelings .
i said , " well , i did n't do so bad , but i also was n't really good at it . "
in the end it worked out , but it 's hard to tell .
some of the tests felt quite easy and natural and some others were very tough . what do you think it was that singled you out from the thousands of others during the grueling , year-long process for the role of european astronaut ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of training are necessary before stepping out into space i 'm actually not completely sure .
i think it might be a little of everything .
certainly there was some luck involved .
i considered myself lucky that my body was good enough to pass the medical test , which i 'm not fully responsible for . a very important component is fascination - fascination for the space program , fascination for the job .
that fascination leads to persistence to follow through with all the tests and all the preparations and to not give up on the way . another very important criterion is working in teams .
i 've shown through experiences i 've had in antarctica that i can perform in a team , and many others have done so as well , and i think that 's a very important criterion for the european space agency . you are a geophysicist , four of the other people chosen are pilots and the fifth works with guidance systems .
what role do you think your position as a scientist plays ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst conducted some of his research in antarctica every good team has to be a diverse one .
the charter of european astronauts says " unity through diversity , " and that 's the motto of all of europe in my opinion .
therefore , i think the european space agency did well by choosing a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences - only then can everyone contribute their experience to the bigger team experience . are you worried about what the future now holds for you ? i would n't call it worried , but it 's certainly a challenge .
i 've got a lot of press attention , but i do n't consider myself someone who has done a lot .
the european space agency puts a huge amount of trust in me and i do n't want to disappoint .
it 's a challenge and i 'm aware that i would like to perform as people expect . does the prospect of being strapped into a rocket and blasted into space frighten you ? no , not at all .
i 'm fascinated by that prospect . i do n't think fear is a helpful emotion in that respect .
i ca n't speak as an astronaut , of course , since i have n't flown yet , but as a scientist who has worked on active volcanoes i know that fear makes us irrational , which can sometimes be dangerous .
that is not a helpful feeling , but what is very important , at the same time , is to have respect for the risks involved - to minimize them and be aware of them .
so respect , yes , but fear , no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moon is a still a far-off goal for the new batch of future astronauts training for future missions to the international space station begins in september , and there is also a chance you could go to the moon in collaboration with nasa and other space agencies .

the trial of burmese pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi , and north korea 's nuclear test crowded other issues off the agenda . two unexpected topics , from asia 's most secretive regimes , led the agenda on monday . instead of focusing on how to fight the economic crisis , or global warming , asem participants were up in arms over the trial of burmese pro-democracy activist aung san suu kyi , as well as the underground nuclear test by north korea on monday .
" the two hottest subjects on the agenda are these two problems , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country currently holds the european union presidency .
delegations from 45 asian and european countries are in hanoi , vietnam , for the ninth annual asia-europe meeting of foreign ministers , or asem .
representatives came from the european union , the association of southeast asian nations , china , japan , south korea , india and pakistan .
eu demands suu kyi 's release suu kyi is scheduled to testify on tuesday and is expected to deny that she broke the terms of her long-time house arrest after a protester from the us broke into her compound earlier this month .
the nobel peace prize winner could face five years in prison for the offense .
the eu repeated its demands for her release during a meeting with the burmese foreign minister , kohout said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is expected to complain about the trial of aung san suu kyi the eu would " clearly state its view of the necessity to release all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi , " eu external relations commissioner ferrero-waldner said .
the asem meeting had also been expected to make a reference to the north korean situation as part of its overall closing statement , but the nuclear detonation on monday , just as the conference opened , sent diplomats scrambling for a more forceful response .
north korea is not among the members of asem , a group that accounts for nearly 60 percent of the world 's population and 60 percent of global trade .
japan seeks statement on north korean test the japanese delegation pressed for asem to issue a separate statement on the test .
speaking at the conference , japanese ministry of foreign affairs spokesman kazuo kodama called the nuclear test " a grave threat to peace and stability . "
" we believe this nuclear test violates existing un security council resolutions , " kodama said .
" we also believe it poses a grave challenge to the -lrb- nuclear proliferation treaty -rrb- regime . "
pyongyang 's delegation met separately with representatives from south korea and china at the asem meeting. jen / th / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu officials condemn north korean nuclear test several eu ministers have joined the international community in condemning monday ’ s test , which has prompted the un security council to call an emergency meeting to discuss further sanctions on north korea .
-lrb- 25.05.2009 -rrb- suu kyi trial to dominate eu-asia summit european foreign ministers will be putting pressure on burma at an asia-europe meeting next week to end the trial of opposition leader aung san suu kyi .

berlusconi said the accusations were part of a political smear campaign against him . on monday , 72-year-old berlusconi promised that there was " nothing , nothing at all " going on between himself and noemi letizia , despite the fact that he attended the young woman 's birthday party last month .
berlusconi 's wife veronica lario said she wanted a divorce after it was reported that her husband gave letizia a gold and diamond necklace .
berlusconi said he attended the birthday party because he knows the model 's father and that he happened to be in naples that day .
berlusconi said the allegations that he is romantically involved with the teenager were part of a political smear campaign against him .
" those who use a private matter as a motive to launch a political attack are behaving in an undignified manner , " berlusconi told cnn on monday .
he promised that the accusations would " boomerang against those who have started -lrb- them -rrb- . "
the scandal comes as berlusconi 's center-right people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party is campaigning for next month 's european parliament elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.05.2009 voter apathy reflects lack of interest in eu affairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentary elections are a pretty dull affair the latest poll into who will vote in the upcoming european parliamentary elections on june 4-7 makes for some pretty grim reading .
it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink . a study carried out across the eu on behalf of the french political innovation foundation shows that 18 percent of those surveyed said they were ' not at all interested ' in the june poll , whilst 35 percent said they were ' rather not interested ' .
the same number said they were ' rather interested ' but only a meager 11 percent said they were ' very interested ' . the data coming in on voter apathy across the european union is turning unspoken but common knowledge into hard facts : the eu elections hold no interest for a huge number of the bloc 's citizens . what is less clear are the reasons why .
attempts have been made to connect the expected dramatically low turn-out with frustration over the incompetence of ministers , the mounting corruption scandals and the perceived idleness that voters associate with the overblown bureaucracy many believe the eu has become . but to equate the apparent refusal of so many europeans to head to the polls with an act of protest assumes that many people actually know or care what happens in brussels and strasbourg .
election experts believe it 's a lot simpler than that . " the european parliament is very important and the people who work there have an important role , but no-one has bothered to explain this to the voters , " professor mark franklin , chair of the european election studies steering group , told deutsche welle .
" it 's not clear what the european parliament does , it 's certainly not clear as to what difference it makes and it regularly throws up electoral lists full of unrecognizable names and faces .
it all adds up to the opinion that there 's no point to any of it . " boring election with no pay-off dr. hermann schmitt , project director at the mannheim center for european social research , told deutsche welle that he thought the lack of a tangible end product was turning voters off . " we know that people are disinterested , even to the degree that they don ’ t even know what 's going on , " he said .
" the main reason for this is that the european elections are seen to be quite unimportant .
this is because , in the european parliament election , the thing that characterizes a normal election is not going to happen – that is , a government is not going to be formed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are not immune from election lethargy " it 's not that people are staying away from these elections because they are critical of the european union and its political process ; it 's just that these elections are so boring and one does n't know why one should participate because not much is going to happen as a result of it , " he added . european parliamentary election turnout has fallen steadily from 66 percent in 1979 to just over 45 percent in 2004 , and in most member states is amongst the lowest for any form of poll . professor franklin is not surprised at all by the predicted voting figures .
he is , if anything , surprised that so many are saying that they intend to take part in this election . " the most amazing thing is that anyone votes at all , " he said .
" why would anyone vote in an election where they have no idea what 's at stake , what the issues are and what , if any , difference the election will have on their lives ?
that ’ s the case with all european elections . " three voting groups make up the numbers franklin believes that those who will vote will come from three groups which can always be relied upon to take part in elections .
these groups vote out of loyalty , habit or just because they want a change of pace . bildunterschrift : the greens traditionally benefit from expressive votes " we have the party loyalists who react to calls from their leaders to vote and save their party humiliation ; then there are those who vote out of habit , who generally believe that voting is a good thing and that they should exercise that right to vote , and then there are the expressive voters who tend to vote for parties , such as the greens , for whom they would n't normally vote in national elections , " he said . " these expressive votes usually come about because the voters know that it doesn ’ t matter who they vote for , because they think it wo n't matter anyway , it just gives them a chance to support someone different . " while eurocrats may be worried about keeping their jobs , a more serious concern is that the expected low turn-out could have unpleasant consequences for the make-up of the future parliament and the political spectrum in europe . lower turn-out plays into extremist hands the lower the turnout , the easier it will be for more radical parties to do well .
as in the 1930s , rising extremism is seen as a key potential risk from the financial crisis and resulting rise in unemployment and hardship . that could potentially see a rise both for far-left parties and right-wingers , including those angry at rising immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's extremist bnp could benefit from voter apathy anti-foreigner rhetoric , and in some cases violence , have increased in several countries in recent months .
analysts are watching the potential rise of the far-right in hungary and the nationalist british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , amongst others . " a low turn-out would certainly have implications in terms of niche or radical fringe parties , " professor franklin said .
" this is where the expressive voters come in .
they may make a choice to vote for a far-right or far-left party because of the reasons i gave before , that they believe that it wo n't make a difference .
they wouldn ’ t do this in national elections because it may have an impact , but in europe – who cares ? " what could happen , though , is that these extremist parties , for example an anti-eu party , may take seats away from others and then make the passing of legislation almost impossible , freezing the political process , " he added . franklin also believes that politics on a national level may suffer across europe as a result . eu elections could color the national voting experience " this european election experience may be the first time that around 50 percent of voters in the eu vote for the first time , " he said .
" if this is their first experience of an electoral vote , imagine what that can do to their opinion of the democratic process !
the next time there 's a national vote , the domestic parties may say , ' those eu elections were n't that important but these ones are ' – but by then an opinion is already starting to form that all elections are pointless , especially among young voters .
this is one of the reasons why national turn-outs are also on the wane across europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign fight involving barroso might excite voters both franklin and schmitt say that a change in the process where electable figureheads are campaigning for office – be it the president of the commission or a future european president – could help encourage people to vote in european elections . " if the parliament would elect the president of the commission and two or three competing candidates would run in these elections , things would be different and turn-out would increase , " schmitt said .
" elections are about horse races , elections are about who is going to govern , elections are about people and faces and whether you like them or you do n't . " a real race - but who would want to run ? " to make the european elections more attractive , the process could include a number of presidential candidates who are running against each other , " franklin said .
" then there will be other politicians who will stand and say ' i support such and such because of this and that ' .
we might then get a debate about what these people intend to do .
it will be a real election with electable faces and personalities . " however , franklin believes that turning european elections into a sexy presidential race will probably not happen any time soon . " someone once said that electing a european president would relegate people , like the president of france , into a role no more important than the governor of texas , " he said .

it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink . a study carried out across the eu on behalf of the french political innovation foundation shows that 18 percent of those surveyed said they were ' not at all interested ' in the june poll , whilst 35 percent said they were ' rather not interested ' .
the same number said they were ' rather interested ' but only a meager 11 percent said they were ' very interested ' . the data coming in on voter apathy across the european union is turning unspoken but common knowledge into hard facts : the eu elections hold no interest for a huge number of the bloc 's citizens . what is less clear are the reasons why .
attempts have been made to connect the expected dramatically low turn-out with frustration over the incompetence of ministers , the mounting corruption scandals and the perceived idleness that voters associate with the overblown bureaucracy many believe the eu has become . but to equate the apparent refusal of so many europeans to head to the polls with an act of protest assumes that many people actually know or care what happens in brussels and strasbourg .
election experts believe it 's a lot simpler than that . " the european parliament is very important and the people who work there have an important role , but no-one has bothered to explain this to the voters , " professor mark franklin , chair of the european election studies steering group , told deutsche welle .
" it 's not clear what the european parliament does , it 's certainly not clear as to what difference it makes and it regularly throws up electoral lists full of unrecognizable names and faces .
it all adds up to the opinion that there 's no point to any of it . " boring election with no pay-off dr. hermann schmitt , project director at the mannheim center for european social research , told deutsche welle that he thought the lack of a tangible end product was turning voters off . " we know that people are disinterested , even to the degree that they don ’ t even know what 's going on , " he said .
" the main reason for this is that the european elections are seen to be quite unimportant .
this is because , in the european parliament election , the thing that characterizes a normal election is not going to happen – that is , a government is not going to be formed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are not immune from election lethargy " it 's not that people are staying away from these elections because they are critical of the european union and its political process ; it 's just that these elections are so boring and one does n't know why one should participate because not much is going to happen as a result of it , " he added . european parliamentary election turnout has fallen steadily from 66 percent in 1979 to just over 45 percent in 2004 , and in most member states is amongst the lowest for any form of poll . professor franklin is not surprised at all by the predicted voting figures .
he is , if anything , surprised that so many are saying that they intend to take part in this election . " the most amazing thing is that anyone votes at all , " he said .
" why would anyone vote in an election where they have no idea what 's at stake , what the issues are and what , if any , difference the election will have on their lives ?
that ’ s the case with all european elections . " three voting groups make up the numbers franklin believes that those who will vote will come from three groups which can always be relied upon to take part in elections .
these groups vote out of loyalty , habit or just because they want a change of pace . bildunterschrift : the greens traditionally benefit from expressive votes " we have the party loyalists who react to calls from their leaders to vote and save their party humiliation ; then there are those who vote out of habit , who generally believe that voting is a good thing and that they should exercise that right to vote , and then there are the expressive voters who tend to vote for parties , such as the greens , for whom they would n't normally vote in national elections , " he said . " these expressive votes usually come about because the voters know that it doesn ’ t matter who they vote for , because they think it wo n't matter anyway , it just gives them a chance to support someone different . " while eurocrats may be worried about keeping their jobs , a more serious concern is that the expected low turn-out could have unpleasant consequences for the make-up of the future parliament and the political spectrum in europe . lower turn-out plays into extremist hands the lower the turnout , the easier it will be for more radical parties to do well .
as in the 1930s , rising extremism is seen as a key potential risk from the financial crisis and resulting rise in unemployment and hardship . that could potentially see a rise both for far-left parties and right-wingers , including those angry at rising immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's extremist bnp could benefit from voter apathy anti-foreigner rhetoric , and in some cases violence , have increased in several countries in recent months .
analysts are watching the potential rise of the far-right in hungary and the nationalist british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , amongst others . " a low turn-out would certainly have implications in terms of niche or radical fringe parties , " professor franklin said .
" this is where the expressive voters come in .
they may make a choice to vote for a far-right or far-left party because of the reasons i gave before , that they believe that it wo n't make a difference .
they wouldn ’ t do this in national elections because it may have an impact , but in europe – who cares ? " what could happen , though , is that these extremist parties , for example an anti-eu party , may take seats away from others and then make the passing of legislation almost impossible , freezing the political process , " he added . franklin also believes that politics on a national level may suffer across europe as a result . eu elections could color the national voting experience " this european election experience may be the first time that around 50 percent of voters in the eu vote for the first time , " he said .
" if this is their first experience of an electoral vote , imagine what that can do to their opinion of the democratic process !
the next time there 's a national vote , the domestic parties may say , ' those eu elections were n't that important but these ones are ' – but by then an opinion is already starting to form that all elections are pointless , especially among young voters .
this is one of the reasons why national turn-outs are also on the wane across europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign fight involving barroso might excite voters both franklin and schmitt say that a change in the process where electable figureheads are campaigning for office – be it the president of the commission or a future european president – could help encourage people to vote in european elections .

" if the parliament would elect the president of the commission and two or three competing candidates would run in these elections , things would be different and turn-out would increase , " schmitt said .
" elections are about horse races , elections are about who is going to govern , elections are about people and faces and whether you like them or you do n't . " a real race - but who would want to run ? " to make the european elections more attractive , the process could include a number of presidential candidates who are running against each other , " franklin said .
" then there will be other politicians who will stand and say ' i support such and such because of this and that ' .
we might then get a debate about what these people intend to do .
it will be a real election with electable faces and personalities . " however , franklin believes that turning european elections into a sexy presidential race will probably not happen any time soon . " someone once said that electing a european president would relegate people , like the president of france , into a role no more important than the governor of texas , " he said .
" real elections for a european president would make national leaders even less relevant , and which politician would want that ? " author : nick amies editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the north conducted the test early on monday , detonating a bomb some 10 kilometers underground in the same area where it conducted an initial nuclear test in october , 2006 .
pyongyang test-fired three short-range , ground-to-air missiles later on monday from the site from which it launched a rocket last month , a south korean news agency reported , citing unnamed sources .

" these irresponsible acts by north korea warrant a firm response by the international community .
the european union will be in contact with its partners to discuss appropriate measures , " solana said in a statement .
the czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he was " very much disturbed " by north korea 's announcement that it had " successfully " carried out a nuclear test .
british prime minister gordon brown described the decision to carry out the tests as " erroneous , misguided and a danger to the world " .

the north conducted the test early on monday , detonating a bomb some 10 kilometers underground in the same area where it conducted an initial nuclear test in october , 2006 .
pyongyang test-fired three short-range , ground-to-air missiles later on monday from the site from which it launched a rocket last month , a south korean news agency reported , citing unnamed sources .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , condemned the test , saying it further threatened peace and security in northeast asia .
" these irresponsible acts by north korea warrant a firm response by the international community .
the european union will be in contact with its partners to discuss appropriate measures , " solana said in a statement .
the czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he was " very much disturbed " by north korea 's announcement that it had " successfully " carried out a nuclear test .
british prime minister gordon brown described the decision to carry out the tests as " erroneous , misguided and a danger to the world " .
" this act will undermine prospects for peace on the korean peninsula and will do nothing for north korea 's security .
the international community will treat north korea as a partner if it behaves responsibly .
if it does not then it can expect only renewed isolation , " brown said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans have demanded that north korea 's kim jong il step down asian neighbors condemn test reactions to the test in asia were also swift .
in south korea , president lee myung-bak has called an emergency meeting of the country 's security council , and in japan officials have set up a task force in the crisis management center of prime minister taro aso 's office .
" it is an act that we can never tolerate , " japanese foreign minister hirofumi nakasone said in hanoi on the sidelines of talks between asian and european ministers .
" as it is a violation of un security council resolutions , japan condemns and protests it strongly .
we , as the only nation to have had a nuclear bomb used against us , feel the need to take stern action . "

the force of the blast was reported to be between 10 and 20 kilotons , a size comparable to that of the atomic bomb explosions in nagasaki and hiroshima at the close of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : monday 's underground blast was as powerful as the atomic bomb the us dropped on hiroshima this second north korean nuclear test was much more powerful than the first in 2006 , which registered a force not greater than one kiloton .
the north vows to continue tests " the test will contribute to safeguarding our sovereignty and socialism and guaranteeing peace and safety on the korean peninsula and the surrounding region . " said the statement from north korea 's official news agency .

the parent company of troubled german department store karstadt is warning that it could go bankrupt if the government does n't provide aid .
but competitors say such a move would be unfair . arcandor has stepped up pressure on the german government to lend it a helping hand .
in interviews over the weekend , the heads of arcandor and its karstadt department store unit warned that without taxpayer assistance to the tune of 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- some 50,000 jobs would be threatened .
arcandor runs not only the karstadt department store chain , but also the mail-order retailer quelle and the thomas cook travel company .
bankruptcy threat " there is no private economic solution .
there is no alternative to state aid , " arcandor ceo karl-gerhard eick told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
he repeated his demand for 650 million euros in loan guarantees and a 200-million-euro credit in saturday 's edition of the bild newspaper .

furthermore , one of arcandor 's competitors , tengelmann , has loudly rejected the company 's bid for public funding .
in an interview with wirtschaftswoche magazine , tengelmann ceo karl-erivan haub said state aid for karstadt " would be a slap in the face for all the companies that had done a good management job " in the past .
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung newspaper has also raised the question of whether karstadt is n't simply stuck in financial turmoil of its own making .
the paper said suppliers had already recalled wares due to lack of payment , and that employee pay is only secured through may .
retailers suffering arcandor 's eick also rejected the idea of a recently discussed merger between karstadt and kaufhof , germany 's other major department store , saying it would be insufficient to prevent the collapse of arcandor .

the parent company of troubled german department store karstadt is warning that it could go bankrupt if the government does n't provide aid .
but competitors say such a move would be unfair . arcandor has stepped up pressure on the german government to lend it a helping hand .
in interviews over the weekend , the heads of arcandor and its karstadt department store unit warned that without taxpayer assistance to the tune of 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- some 50,000 jobs would be threatened .
arcandor runs not only the karstadt department store chain , but also the mail-order retailer quelle and the thomas cook travel company .
bankruptcy threat " there is no private economic solution .
there is no alternative to state aid , " arcandor ceo karl-gerhard eick told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
he repeated his demand for 650 million euros in loan guarantees and a 200-million-euro credit in saturday 's edition of the bild newspaper .
" without guarantees we have to find a new route , and that could include bankruptcy , " he told the paper .

furthermore , he warned , a bankruptcy could have an effect on suppliers and ulitmately it could be " a catastrophe for germany 's downtown shopping zones . "
cool response from politicians so far , politicians appear to be unmoved by the threats .
to date , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has reacted cautiously to the arcandor warnings .
and volker kauder , a leading member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , rejected the notion of state aid for karstadt , noting that the firm was already in trouble before the current banking crisis began .
furthermore , one of arcandor 's competitors , tengelmann , has loudly rejected the company 's bid for public funding .
in an interview with wirtschaftswoche magazine , tengelmann ceo karl-erivan haub said state aid for karstadt " would be a slap in the face for all the companies that had done a good management job " in the past .
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung newspaper has also raised the question of whether karstadt is n't simply stuck in financial turmoil of its own making .
the paper said suppliers had already recalled wares due to lack of payment , and that employee pay is only secured through may .
retailers suffering arcandor 's eick also rejected the idea of a recently discussed merger between karstadt and kaufhof , germany 's other major department store , saying it would be insufficient to prevent the collapse of arcandor .
the merger is merely a poorly disguised attempt by kaufhof to drive karstadt into bankruptcy and to pick off individual karstadt department stores , according to eick .

" maturity test " follows teenagers as they struggle to care for borrowed babies .
germany 's family minister has also weighed in against the show . german family minister ursula von der leyen is the latest and most prominent german child advocate to speak out against private television channel rtl 's decision to go ahead with “ erwachsen auf probe ” , or " grown-up on probation " . von der leyen urged rtl to either “ stop the show or thoroughly re-work it . ”
yet rtl has said it will do no such thing and intends to air the first episode on june 3 as planned .
the show follows four teenage couples who have said they want to become parents .
the teenagers are given a borrowed baby to care for over several days and tv crews document their struggles to change diapers and quiet temper tantrums .
the show poses the question : are these teenagers really ready to take on parenthood ?
children " at risk " criticism from child advocates has been building in recent weeks .
german child advocates say the show exploits the young children who are being loaned out to inexperienced teenagers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen says the show could harm the children involved “ one asks oneself the entire time : what about the children ?
where are their rights ? ” von der leyen told spiegel magazine .
the german parliament 's commission for children issued a statement in which it chastised rtl for using children as guinea pigs and for “ exploiting children in an irresponsible manner . ”
the commission urged rtl not to air the series .
germany 's federation for the protection of children has also weighed in , saying it is " furious " at the concept , which it claims puts children at " high risk . "
the show has cleared all necessary regulatory hurdles .
rtl has pointed out that the babies are monitored around the clock by child psychologists and doctors to ensure that the inexperienced caregivers do no harm and that the parents are also just off camera .
“ we have kept the well-being of the children , couples and parents who are participating in mind as well as the effect on our viewers , ” rtl ceo anke schaeferkordt said .
“ we have taken our responsibility very seriously . ”
teen pregnancy in the spotlight in response to recent criticism , rtl published an interview with one mother , identified as katrin , who lent her 10-month-old son lasse to the program .
the woman said she did not fear for her son 's safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show 's planners say they intend to spark a discussion about teen pregnancy “ the trial parents managed very well , lasse managed very well and there was always a pediatrician or someone else nearby … lasse had so much fun during the project , ” the mother said .
rtl views the show , which is an adaptation of the bbc 's " the baby borrowers " , as helping to usher in an important discussion over teen pregnancy .
von der leyen dismissed this rationale , saying that teen pregnancy is a topic well covered by german schools .
she told spiegel that , while teenage pregnancy is a pressing issue in the uk , it is much less of a problem in germany .

" maturity test " follows teenagers as they struggle to care for borrowed babies .
germany 's family minister has also weighed in against the show . german family minister ursula von der leyen is the latest and most prominent german child advocate to speak out against private television channel rtl 's decision to go ahead with “ erwachsen auf probe ” , or " grown-up on probation " . von der leyen urged rtl to either “ stop the show or thoroughly re-work it . ”
yet rtl has said it will do no such thing and intends to air the first episode on june 3 as planned .
the show follows four teenage couples who have said they want to become parents .
the teenagers are given a borrowed baby to care for over several days and tv crews document their struggles to change diapers and quiet temper tantrums .
the show poses the question : are these teenagers really ready to take on parenthood ?
children " at risk " criticism from child advocates has been building in recent weeks .
german child advocates say the show exploits the young children who are being loaned out to inexperienced teenagers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen says the show could harm the children involved “ one asks oneself the entire time : what about the children ?
where are their rights ? ” von der leyen told spiegel magazine .
the german parliament 's commission for children issued a statement in which it chastised rtl for using children as guinea pigs and for “ exploiting children in an irresponsible manner . ”
the commission urged rtl not to air the series .
germany 's federation for the protection of children has also weighed in , saying it is " furious " at the concept , which it claims puts children at " high risk . "
the show has cleared all necessary regulatory hurdles .
rtl has pointed out that the babies are monitored around the clock by child psychologists and doctors to ensure that the inexperienced caregivers do no harm and that the parents are also just off camera .
“ we have kept the well-being of the children , couples and parents who are participating in mind as well as the effect on our viewers , ” rtl ceo anke schaeferkordt said .
“ we have taken our responsibility very seriously . ”
teen pregnancy in the spotlight in response to recent criticism , rtl published an interview with one mother , identified as katrin , who lent her 10-month-old son lasse to the program .
the woman said she did not fear for her son 's safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show 's planners say they intend to spark a discussion about teen pregnancy “ the trial parents managed very well , lasse managed very well and there was always a pediatrician or someone else nearby … lasse had so much fun during the project , ” the mother said .
rtl views the show , which is an adaptation of the bbc 's " the baby borrowers " , as helping to usher in an important discussion over teen pregnancy .
von der leyen dismissed this rationale , saying that teen pregnancy is a topic well covered by german schools .
she told spiegel that , while teenage pregnancy is a pressing issue in the uk , it is much less of a problem in germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show 's planners say they intend to spark a discussion about teen pregnancy “ the trial parents managed very well , lasse managed very well and there was always a pediatrician or someone else nearby … lasse had so much fun during the project , ” the mother said .
rtl views the show , which is an adaptation of the bbc 's " the baby borrowers " , as helping to usher in an important discussion over teen pregnancy .
von der leyen dismissed this rationale , saying that teen pregnancy is a topic well covered by german schools .
she told spiegel that , while teenage pregnancy is a pressing issue in the uk , it is much less of a problem in germany .
according to unicef statistics , german teenagers account for 13 out of each 1,000 births .
in comparison , british teenagers account for 30 of 1,000 births and the united states has 52 per 1,000 births. th / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aging oil rigs need fresh capital in a speech distributed to the media , roberto poli , the ceo of italian energy group eni , said , " the persistence of high uncertainties related to oil prices up to $ 150 per barrel , or down to $ 30 , could upset the entire energy system , blocking investments both in traditional and alternative sources . "
in order to stabilize prices , poli urged governments to institute more regulation of oil financial markets , which he called " opaque and uncontrollable . "
the group of eight is looking for ways to ensure steady oil and gas supplies at reasonable prices , while allowing for moderate price increases to make it financially worthwhile for energy companies to explore for oil and gas deposits .
the energy meeting - which included the united states , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia - will present a draft energy strategy to a g8 leaders ' summit , scheduled for july in l 'aquila , italy. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in a new tack , borloo said countries such as the united states , which have said they can not implement such deep cuts by 2020 , could contribute to a new climate pact in other ways , for example by financing green technologies for developing nations .
this would give such nations the chance to catch up with emission reductions later on .
" there can be more flexibility among us , " borloo told the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in paris on monday .
" there may be some who act faster and others who do more later .
" there may be constraints on such and such a developed nation - but we must reach this 2020 objective of 25 to 40 percent , " he said .
finger pointing continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel says developing countries are still waiting for rich nations to act first developing nations led by china and india have accused rich nations of giving their economies greater priority than fighting climate change .
they charge that developed countries have not kept their promises to take the lead in cutting the burning of fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said , however , that developing countries were also not ready to commit to decreasing carbon emissions .
" the longer it takes for industrialized nations to have a common position , the longer we will have to wait until china and india move -lrb- on climate change -rrb- , " he said in paris .
copenhagen hopes the mef was called last month by us president barack obama .
it is the second of three preparatory gatherings ahead of another climate summit to be held in italy in july .
the role of the forums is to identify common ground between the world 's major emitters ahead of a major united nations climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
it is hoped that a new , planet-wide treaty regulating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can be agreed at the december meeting .
any new pact would take effect after 2012 , when the current conventions under the kyoto protocol are due to expire .
" the world 's destiny will probably be at stake in copenhagen , " borloo said .
" copenhagen is not a retrograde vision , it 's not the start of negative -lrb- economic -rrb- growth , but a new start for strong , sustainable , sober carbon development . "
us defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consensus is that time is running out for major polluters to ratify a new treaty a us congressional panel last week approved a bill that would cut us carbon emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 .
the european union , meanwhile , has pledged cuts of 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and 30 percent if other wealthy nations get on board .
despite the disparity , us officials maintain their country is pulling its weight .
" i do n't think it 's correct to say that europe is proposing a lot and the united states little , " todd stern , us special envoy for climate change , told tuesday 's edition of the french daily le monde .
" if you look at things from the point of view of the progress that each nation will have to make to reach its objectives , the us level of effort is probably equal , or superior , to that of europe , " stern added .

" there can be more flexibility among us , " borloo told the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in paris on monday .
" there may be some who act faster and others who do more later .
" there may be constraints on such and such a developed nation - but we must reach this 2020 objective of 25 to 40 percent , " he said .

they charge that developed countries have not kept their promises to take the lead in cutting the burning of fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said , however , that developing countries were also not ready to commit to decreasing carbon emissions .
" the longer it takes for industrialized nations to have a common position , the longer we will have to wait until china and india move -lrb- on climate change -rrb- , " he said in paris .
copenhagen hopes the mef was called last month by us president barack obama .
it is the second of three preparatory gatherings ahead of another climate summit to be held in italy in july .
the role of the forums is to identify common ground between the world 's major emitters ahead of a major united nations climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
it is hoped that a new , planet-wide treaty regulating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can be agreed at the december meeting .
any new pact would take effect after 2012 , when the current conventions under the kyoto protocol are due to expire .
" the world 's destiny will probably be at stake in copenhagen , " borloo said .
" copenhagen is not a retrograde vision , it 's not the start of negative -lrb- economic -rrb- growth , but a new start for strong , sustainable , sober carbon development . "

berlusconi said the accusations were part of a political smear campaign against him . on monday , 72-year-old berlusconi promised that there was " nothing , nothing at all " going on between himself and noemi letizia , despite the fact that he attended the young woman 's birthday party last month .

the international jazz archive in eisenach which documents it all is celebrating its 10th anniversary . it 's not beginning that 's rewarded , but persevering , said reinhard lorenz .
as one of the co-founders of the international jazz archive in eisenach , lorenz , the head of the town 's culture department , knows what he 's talking about : he 's helped develop the archive over the past decade . located just a few steps from the town center , the archive is located in the historic old malthouse .
downstairs in the vaulted cellar , live jazz is performed at club called " posaune " - or trombone . founded in 1959 , the jazz club has n't had an easy path , but without it , the archive would have been impossible .
eisenach is in what used to be east germany and , during the communist period , jazz was defamed because it came from the american " class enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive is housed in eisenach 's historic old malthouse but jazz fans in eisenach employed a small political trick to establish the " subversive " style of music - they said that jazz and folk were the voice of the american proletariat , which would have appealed to the communists . jewels of jazz " what there is to find under eisenach skies is unbelievable , " filmmaker wim wenders wrote in the guestbook at the international jazz archive while he was there doing research for his film " the soul of a man . " indeed , the archive is a treasure chest : 80,000 records and sound files , just as many photographs and negatives , 60,000 magazines , and numerous articles , posters , books , correspondence and films . the ground floor contains items that belonged to blues pianist guenter boas , who passed away in 1993 .
lorenz was fascinated by the man when he met him at a concert in former east germany . " guenter boas played with all the greats of this world - with armstrong , with fitzgerald and he corresponded with all the blues people , " said lorenz .
" we have over 1,000 letters here from his estate .
they 're music history treasures . " a life-size black-and-white picture of boas , hung over a leather sofa , greets visitors when they enter the archive . from the source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trevor richards entrusted what survived of his collection to the archive eisenach 's reputation for taking good care of jazz paraphernalia - a job done so far by volunteers - has reached all the way to new orleans . from what is considered to be the birthplace of jazz , percussionist trevor richards sent the archive a container full of records , books and percussion instruments .
a large part of his extensive collection had been damaged in hurricane katrina and what survived has been cleaned up and is now housed in eisenach . but in addition to the american articles , the archive also stays true to its local roots : a small museum portion informs visitors about jazz in former communist east germany with info boards and photographs . also in eisenach is the birth house of composer js bach has practically become a mecca for music lovers of all kinds and lorenz said he hopes the international jazz archive will soon become a significant center for jazz lovers and researchers alike . author : susanne von schenck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a 33-year-old german geophysicist , gerst will prepare to travel to space in september . deutsche welle : congratulations on being selected as one of the european space agency 's astronauts .
what was your first reaction when you got the news ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst said he is not afraid of being shot into space alexander gerst : it was the greatest feeling i could imagine at that time .
it was obviously a great dream of mine that i 'd had for most of my life that was fulfilled at that moment .
it 's hard to describe . you are basically living a dream ? yes , i was .
for me it is a long-standing dream to explore our planet and the space around it .
i was always a very curious person .
as a child i turned over every stone and looked behind every tree and i liked to explore .
for me now , after becoming a scientist , which allows me to do those things down here on earth , this new job offers me the chance to do the same in space which is the ultimate way for me to do science and exploration . thousands of people sent in applications to become one of europe 's astronauts .
how difficult was the selection process ? some of the tests were , obviously , quite tough - even for a successful candidate , they were n't easy at all .
i never went out of a test saying , " i 've got this one in the bag . "
i always came out with mixed feelings .
i said , " well , i did n't do so bad , but i also was n't really good at it . "
in the end it worked out , but it 's hard to tell .
some of the tests felt quite easy and natural and some others were very tough . what do you think it was that singled you out from the thousands of others during the grueling , year-long process for the role of european astronaut ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of training are necessary before stepping out into space i 'm actually not completely sure .
i think it might be a little of everything .
certainly there was some luck involved .
i considered myself lucky that my body was good enough to pass the medical test , which i 'm not fully responsible for . a very important component is fascination - fascination for the space program , fascination for the job .
that fascination leads to persistence to follow through with all the tests and all the preparations and to not give up on the way . another very important criterion is working in teams .
i 've shown through experiences i 've had in antarctica that i can perform in a team , and many others have done so as well , and i think that 's a very important criterion for the european space agency . you are a geophysicist , four of the other people chosen are pilots and the fifth works with guidance systems .
what role do you think your position as a scientist plays ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst conducted some of his research in antarctica every good team has to be a diverse one .
the charter of european astronauts says " unity through diversity , " and that 's the motto of all of europe in my opinion .
therefore , i think the european space agency did well by choosing a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences - only then can everyone contribute their experience to the bigger team experience . are you worried about what the future now holds for you ? i would n't call it worried , but it 's certainly a challenge .
i 've got a lot of press attention , but i do n't consider myself someone who has done a lot .
the european space agency puts a huge amount of trust in me and i do n't want to disappoint .
it 's a challenge and i 'm aware that i would like to perform as people expect . does the prospect of being strapped into a rocket and blasted into space frighten you ? no , not at all .
i 'm fascinated by that prospect . i do n't think fear is a helpful emotion in that respect .
i ca n't speak as an astronaut , of course , since i have n't flown yet , but as a scientist who has worked on active volcanoes i know that fear makes us irrational , which can sometimes be dangerous .
that is not a helpful feeling , but what is very important , at the same time , is to have respect for the risks involved - to minimize them and be aware of them .
so respect , yes , but fear , no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moon is a still a far-off goal for the new batch of future astronauts training for future missions to the international space station begins in september , and there is also a chance you could go to the moon in collaboration with nasa and other space agencies .
what will you , personally , be looking forward to ? the moon program is quite far away , so i ca n't put myself in any role there because it 's certainly not clear who is going to be on that mission .
i would personally love to be there .
i know that the moon is full of treasures for us . i would rather concentrate now on closer things , like my training and , after that , flights to the international space station . there is a lot of science to be done there that is so important for us down here on earth .
in economic and scientific ways there is very important research to be done up there and that is what i would like to concentrate on most . interview : rajiv sharma -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" maturity test " follows teenagers as they struggle to care for borrowed babies .
germany 's family minister has also weighed in against the show . german family minister ursula von der leyen is the latest and most prominent german child advocate to speak out against private television channel rtl 's decision to go ahead with “ erwachsen auf probe ” , or " grown-up on probation " . von der leyen urged rtl to either “ stop the show or thoroughly re-work it . ”
yet rtl has said it will do no such thing and intends to air the first episode on june 3 as planned .
the show follows four teenage couples who have said they want to become parents .
the teenagers are given a borrowed baby to care for over several days and tv crews document their struggles to change diapers and quiet temper tantrums .
the show poses the question : are these teenagers really ready to take on parenthood ?
children " at risk " criticism from child advocates has been building in recent weeks .
german child advocates say the show exploits the young children who are being loaned out to inexperienced teenagers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen says the show could harm the children involved “ one asks oneself the entire time : what about the children ?
where are their rights ? ” von der leyen told spiegel magazine .
the german parliament 's commission for children issued a statement in which it chastised rtl for using children as guinea pigs and for “ exploiting children in an irresponsible manner . ”
the commission urged rtl not to air the series .
germany 's federation for the protection of children has also weighed in , saying it is " furious " at the concept , which it claims puts children at " high risk . "
the show has cleared all necessary regulatory hurdles .
rtl has pointed out that the babies are monitored around the clock by child psychologists and doctors to ensure that the inexperienced caregivers do no harm and that the parents are also just off camera .
“ we have kept the well-being of the children , couples and parents who are participating in mind as well as the effect on our viewers , ” rtl ceo anke schaeferkordt said .
“ we have taken our responsibility very seriously . ”
teen pregnancy in the spotlight in response to recent criticism , rtl published an interview with one mother , identified as katrin , who lent her 10-month-old son lasse to the program .
the woman said she did not fear for her son 's safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show 's planners say they intend to spark a discussion about teen pregnancy “ the trial parents managed very well , lasse managed very well and there was always a pediatrician or someone else nearby … lasse had so much fun during the project , ” the mother said .
rtl views the show , which is an adaptation of the bbc 's " the baby borrowers " , as helping to usher in an important discussion over teen pregnancy .
von der leyen dismissed this rationale , saying that teen pregnancy is a topic well covered by german schools .
she told spiegel that , while teenage pregnancy is a pressing issue in the uk , it is much less of a problem in germany .
according to unicef statistics , german teenagers account for 13 out of each 1,000 births .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 25.05.2009 france , germany push for more flexible climate pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any new climate deal must be flexible , france and germany say rich nations should collectively sign up to carbon emission cuts of up to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , germany and france told ministers from nations accounting for around 80 percent of global carbon emissions . french environment minister jean-louis borloo told the gathering of 17 top greenhouse gas emitters including china , the us , russia and india that developed nations should aim for cuts of between 25 and 40 percent .
but in a new tack , borloo said countries such as the united states , which have said they can not implement such deep cuts by 2020 , could contribute to a new climate pact in other ways , for example by financing green technologies for developing nations .
this would give such nations the chance to catch up with emission reductions later on .
" there can be more flexibility among us , " borloo told the major economies forum -lrb- mef -rrb- in paris on monday .
" there may be some who act faster and others who do more later .
" there may be constraints on such and such a developed nation - but we must reach this 2020 objective of 25 to 40 percent , " he said .
finger pointing continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel says developing countries are still waiting for rich nations to act first developing nations led by china and india have accused rich nations of giving their economies greater priority than fighting climate change .
they charge that developed countries have not kept their promises to take the lead in cutting the burning of fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said , however , that developing countries were also not ready to commit to decreasing carbon emissions .
" the longer it takes for industrialized nations to have a common position , the longer we will have to wait until china and india move -lrb- on climate change -rrb- , " he said in paris .
copenhagen hopes the mef was called last month by us president barack obama .
it is the second of three preparatory gatherings ahead of another climate summit to be held in italy in july .
the role of the forums is to identify common ground between the world 's major emitters ahead of a major united nations climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
it is hoped that a new , planet-wide treaty regulating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can be agreed at the december meeting .
any new pact would take effect after 2012 , when the current conventions under the kyoto protocol are due to expire .
" the world 's destiny will probably be at stake in copenhagen , " borloo said .
" copenhagen is not a retrograde vision , it 's not the start of negative -lrb- economic -rrb- growth , but a new start for strong , sustainable , sober carbon development . "
us defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consensus is that time is running out for major polluters to ratify a new treaty a us congressional panel last week approved a bill that would cut us carbon emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 .
the european union , meanwhile , has pledged cuts of 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , and 30 percent if other wealthy nations get on board .
despite the disparity , us officials maintain their country is pulling its weight .
" i do n't think it 's correct to say that europe is proposing a lot and the united states little , " todd stern , us special envoy for climate change , told tuesday 's edition of the french daily le monde .
" if you look at things from the point of view of the progress that each nation will have to make to reach its objectives , the us level of effort is probably equal , or superior , to that of europe , " stern added .
the paris mef is due to run until tuesday and will also focus on climate financing and the transfer of clean technologies. dfm / afpd / afpe / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german environment minister sigmar gabriel said , however , that developing countries were also not ready to commit to decreasing carbon emissions .

it is the second of three preparatory gatherings ahead of another climate summit to be held in italy in july .
the role of the forums is to identify common ground between the world 's major emitters ahead of a major united nations climate meeting in copenhagen in december .
it is hoped that a new , planet-wide treaty regulating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can be agreed at the december meeting .
any new pact would take effect after 2012 , when the current conventions under the kyoto protocol are due to expire .
" the world 's destiny will probably be at stake in copenhagen , " borloo said .

concluding their two-day meeting on monday , the g8 nations said governments and businesses must work to keep energy prices stable or risk hampering a recovery .

ministers meeting in brussels on monday also adopted a set of common standards and sanctions against employers who hire illegal foreign immigrants .
these include making it mandatory for businesses to ensure that non-eu workers hold a valid residence permit and that a copy of such permits be kept on record should inspectors demand to see it .
eu-wide penalties would consist of fines , which would increase according to the number of illegally employed foreigners , and the possible exclusion of guilty businesses from accessing public funds or taking part in public tenders .
new rules designed to end abuses on the other hand , signing up to the blue card scheme would give foreign workers limited social welfare rights and benefits , and allow them to bring in their families while they work in an eu country .
the new rules are designed to end abuses by unscrupulous employers who hire illegal immigrants and then pay them sub-standard wages under poor working conditions .
the european commission 's far more ambitious initial proposal was watered down significantly by national governments , which insisted that it should be up to them to decide how many migrants should enter their countries and what qualifications eligible workers should have .
three eu members - britain , ireland and denmark - are not participating in the blue card program , preferring instead to set their own guidelines. gb / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the international jazz archive in eisenach which documents it all is celebrating its 10th anniversary . it 's not beginning that 's rewarded , but persevering , said reinhard lorenz .
as one of the co-founders of the international jazz archive in eisenach , lorenz , the head of the town 's culture department , knows what he 's talking about : he 's helped develop the archive over the past decade . located just a few steps from the town center , the archive is located in the historic old malthouse .
downstairs in the vaulted cellar , live jazz is performed at club called " posaune " - or trombone . founded in 1959 , the jazz club has n't had an easy path , but without it , the archive would have been impossible .
eisenach is in what used to be east germany and , during the communist period , jazz was defamed because it came from the american " class enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive is housed in eisenach 's historic old malthouse but jazz fans in eisenach employed a small political trick to establish the " subversive " style of music - they said that jazz and folk were the voice of the american proletariat , which would have appealed to the communists . jewels of jazz " what there is to find under eisenach skies is unbelievable , " filmmaker wim wenders wrote in the guestbook at the international jazz archive while he was there doing research for his film " the soul of a man . " indeed , the archive is a treasure chest : 80,000 records and sound files , just as many photographs and negatives , 60,000 magazines , and numerous articles , posters , books , correspondence and films . the ground floor contains items that belonged to blues pianist guenter boas , who passed away in 1993 .
lorenz was fascinated by the man when he met him at a concert in former east germany . " guenter boas played with all the greats of this world - with armstrong , with fitzgerald and he corresponded with all the blues people , " said lorenz .
" we have over 1,000 letters here from his estate .
they 're music history treasures . " a life-size black-and-white picture of boas , hung over a leather sofa , greets visitors when they enter the archive . from the source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trevor richards entrusted what survived of his collection to the archive eisenach 's reputation for taking good care of jazz paraphernalia - a job done so far by volunteers - has reached all the way to new orleans . from what is considered to be the birthplace of jazz , percussionist trevor richards sent the archive a container full of records , books and percussion instruments .
a large part of his extensive collection had been damaged in hurricane katrina and what survived has been cleaned up and is now housed in eisenach . but in addition to the american articles , the archive also stays true to its local roots : a small museum portion informs visitors about jazz in former communist east germany with info boards and photographs . also in eisenach is the birth house of composer js bach has practically become a mecca for music lovers of all kinds and lorenz said he hopes the international jazz archive will soon become a significant center for jazz lovers and researchers alike . author : susanne von schenck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 25.05.2009 international german archive recounts jazz ' turbulent history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american jazz traveled swiftly across the atlantic in the 20th century frowned upon and even banned under the nazi and communist regimes , jazz has had a rough time in 20th-century germany .
the international jazz archive in eisenach which documents it all is celebrating its 10th anniversary . it 's not beginning that 's rewarded , but persevering , said reinhard lorenz .
as one of the co-founders of the international jazz archive in eisenach , lorenz , the head of the town 's culture department , knows what he 's talking about : he 's helped develop the archive over the past decade . located just a few steps from the town center , the archive is located in the historic old malthouse .
downstairs in the vaulted cellar , live jazz is performed at club called " posaune " - or trombone . founded in 1959 , the jazz club has n't had an easy path , but without it , the archive would have been impossible .
eisenach is in what used to be east germany and , during the communist period , jazz was defamed because it came from the american " class enemy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the archive is housed in eisenach 's historic old malthouse but jazz fans in eisenach employed a small political trick to establish the " subversive " style of music - they said that jazz and folk were the voice of the american proletariat , which would have appealed to the communists . jewels of jazz " what there is to find under eisenach skies is unbelievable , " filmmaker wim wenders wrote in the guestbook at the international jazz archive while he was there doing research for his film " the soul of a man . " indeed , the archive is a treasure chest : 80,000 records and sound files , just as many photographs and negatives , 60,000 magazines , and numerous articles , posters , books , correspondence and films . the ground floor contains items that belonged to blues pianist guenter boas , who passed away in 1993 .
lorenz was fascinated by the man when he met him at a concert in former east germany . " guenter boas played with all the greats of this world - with armstrong , with fitzgerald and he corresponded with all the blues people , " said lorenz .
" we have over 1,000 letters here from his estate .
they 're music history treasures . " a life-size black-and-white picture of boas , hung over a leather sofa , greets visitors when they enter the archive . from the source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trevor richards entrusted what survived of his collection to the archive eisenach 's reputation for taking good care of jazz paraphernalia - a job done so far by volunteers - has reached all the way to new orleans . from what is considered to be the birthplace of jazz , percussionist trevor richards sent the archive a container full of records , books and percussion instruments .

german business confidence rose in may for the second time in a row .

this was the second increase in a row for the poll of 7,000 business leaders . but a reuters poll showed respondents had expected the index to increase to 85 points , and so reaction to the news was mixed .

some read the poll as a sign of a rosy future .

the recession is losing speed , and could be over by the autumn . "
' anemic ' improvement still , he warned that the coming improvements should n't be overestimated .
any improvements after that will be " anemic . "

german business confidence rose in may for the second time in a row .
but observers say that the increase was less than forecast , and that the recession is far from over in germany . the munich-based ifo research institute said its closely-watched business-confidence index climbed to 84.2 points from 83.7 points in april .
this was the second increase in a row for the poll of 7,000 business leaders . but a reuters poll showed respondents had expected the index to increase to 85 points , and so reaction to the news was mixed .
mixed signal economists take the ifo reading as a serious measure of germany 's economic outlook .
some read the poll as a sign of a rosy future .
analyst joerg kraemer from commerzbank told reuters the measure was a " further clear signal that the plunging german economy is a thing of the past .
the recession is losing speed , and could be over by the autumn . "
' anemic ' improvement still , he warned that the coming improvements should n't be overestimated .
any improvements after that will be " anemic . "
other analysts saw the data in a less positive light .
despite the general improvement in sentiment , leading economic forecasters see germany facing six percent contraction in its economy this year , which is likely to trigger an increase in unemployment. jen / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a 33-year-old german geophysicist , gerst will prepare to travel to space in september . deutsche welle : congratulations on being selected as one of the european space agency 's astronauts .
what was your first reaction when you got the news ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst said he is not afraid of being shot into space alexander gerst : it was the greatest feeling i could imagine at that time .
it was obviously a great dream of mine that i 'd had for most of my life that was fulfilled at that moment .
it 's hard to describe . you are basically living a dream ? yes , i was .
for me it is a long-standing dream to explore our planet and the space around it .
i was always a very curious person .
as a child i turned over every stone and looked behind every tree and i liked to explore .
for me now , after becoming a scientist , which allows me to do those things down here on earth , this new job offers me the chance to do the same in space which is the ultimate way for me to do science and exploration . thousands of people sent in applications to become one of europe 's astronauts .
how difficult was the selection process ? some of the tests were , obviously , quite tough - even for a successful candidate , they were n't easy at all .
i never went out of a test saying , " i 've got this one in the bag . "
i always came out with mixed feelings .
i said , " well , i did n't do so bad , but i also was n't really good at it . "
in the end it worked out , but it 's hard to tell .
some of the tests felt quite easy and natural and some others were very tough . what do you think it was that singled you out from the thousands of others during the grueling , year-long process for the role of european astronaut ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of training are necessary before stepping out into space i 'm actually not completely sure .
i think it might be a little of everything .
certainly there was some luck involved .
i considered myself lucky that my body was good enough to pass the medical test , which i 'm not fully responsible for . a very important component is fascination - fascination for the space program , fascination for the job .
that fascination leads to persistence to follow through with all the tests and all the preparations and to not give up on the way . another very important criterion is working in teams .
i 've shown through experiences i 've had in antarctica that i can perform in a team , and many others have done so as well , and i think that 's a very important criterion for the european space agency . you are a geophysicist , four of the other people chosen are pilots and the fifth works with guidance systems .
what role do you think your position as a scientist plays ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerst conducted some of his research in antarctica every good team has to be a diverse one .
the charter of european astronauts says " unity through diversity , " and that 's the motto of all of europe in my opinion .
therefore , i think the european space agency did well by choosing a diverse team with different backgrounds and experiences - only then can everyone contribute their experience to the bigger team experience . are you worried about what the future now holds for you ? i would n't call it worried , but it 's certainly a challenge .
i 've got a lot of press attention , but i do n't consider myself someone who has done a lot .
the european space agency puts a huge amount of trust in me and i do n't want to disappoint .
it 's a challenge and i 'm aware that i would like to perform as people expect . does the prospect of being strapped into a rocket and blasted into space frighten you ? no , not at all .
i 'm fascinated by that prospect . i do n't think fear is a helpful emotion in that respect .
i ca n't speak as an astronaut , of course , since i have n't flown yet , but as a scientist who has worked on active volcanoes i know that fear makes us irrational , which can sometimes be dangerous .
that is not a helpful feeling , but what is very important , at the same time , is to have respect for the risks involved - to minimize them and be aware of them .
so respect , yes , but fear , no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moon is a still a far-off goal for the new batch of future astronauts training for future missions to the international space station begins in september , and there is also a chance you could go to the moon in collaboration with nasa and other space agencies .
what will you , personally , be looking forward to ? the moon program is quite far away , so i ca n't put myself in any role there because it 's certainly not clear who is going to be on that mission .
i would personally love to be there .
i know that the moon is full of treasures for us . i would rather concentrate now on closer things , like my training and , after that , flights to the international space station . there is a lot of science to be done there that is so important for us down here on earth .
in economic and scientific ways there is very important research to be done up there and that is what i would like to concentrate on most . interview : rajiv sharma -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was obviously a great dream of mine that i 'd had for most of my life that was fulfilled at that moment .
it 's hard to describe . you are basically living a dream ? yes , i was .
for me it is a long-standing dream to explore our planet and the space around it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 25.05.2009 hezbollah denies german media reports of involvement in hariri death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese police at the scene of the hariri bombing the lebanon-based militant group hezbollah has been forced on to the back foot over allegations made by a german news magazine that it was behind the assassination of former prime minister rafik al-hariri in 2005 . in a statement posted on its web site , hezbollah rejected the allegations , calling them " fabrications " that were intended to affect the outcome of lebanese general elections on june 7 .
" publishing these accusations and attributing them to sources close to the international court dents the credibility of the tribunal and its work and requires firm and clear action towards the publishers of these evil fabrications , " it added .
german weekly news magazine der spiegel quoted sources close to the united nations special tribunal for lebanon – which is tasked with investigating the assassination of hariri – saying that lebanese investigators had , for the first time , linked hezbollah ’ s " operational arm " with a number of cell phones used in the area at the time of hariri ’ s death . on february 14 , 2005 , a truck filled with explosives blew up near hariri 's motorcade , killing him and 22 others .
initial un investigations implicated syrian and lebanese military officers but these details were later withheld pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster of slain former lebanese prime minister rafik al-hariri " the investigation … is ongoing , work is continuing , unfortunately for purposes of maintaining the confidentiality of our work this is an investigation that looks like any police investigation throughout the world and it can not be debated throughout the media , " said radhia achouri , spokesperson for daniel bellemare , chief prosecutor for the un special tribunal . " we do n't know where -lrb- spiegel is -rrb- getting the story from , " she added . mixed reactions russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , who was meeting with lebanese government officials in beirut , denounced the german report as provocative , while syria ’ s foreign minister said the article undermined the international investigation into hariri ’ s death . saying that un investigators had not questioned anyone from hezbollah , lebanese foreign minister fawzi salloukh said that der spiegel 's article was " totally false . " in israel , however , foreign minister avigdor lieberman is reported to have told a weekly cabinet meeting that the article " just proves who we are dealing with . " political consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saad al-hariri and his supporters could stand to earn the vote of lebanese christians the latest twist in the hariri investigation comes at a time when the two factions contesting the upcoming general election are locked in a dead heat .
on one side are the us-backed so-called " march 14 " forces , led by saad al-hariri - the son of rafik al-hariri – which holds a parliamentary majority .
on the other side is hezbollah , which is supported by iran and syria . gil yaron , a middle east analyst and journalist working in the region , says that if the allegations were confirmed , that could cause lebanese christian swing voters to turn their backs on hezbollah in support of the sunni forces under saad al-hariri , thus delivering his party victory . " in addition to this , these allegations could have international repercussions .
the arab states will certainly be very upset with hezbollah , would it turn out that hezbollah has killed a sunni , very prominent politician , " yaron said . " but also the new policy of rapprochement that the uk and other european states have formulated trying to talk to hezbollah , would certainly see a revaluation , should it turn out that hezbollah is a terrorist organization which also kills arab politicians .

the parent company of troubled german department store karstadt is warning that it could go bankrupt if the government does n't provide aid .
but competitors say such a move would be unfair . arcandor has stepped up pressure on the german government to lend it a helping hand .
in interviews over the weekend , the heads of arcandor and its karstadt department store unit warned that without taxpayer assistance to the tune of 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- some 50,000 jobs would be threatened .
arcandor runs not only the karstadt department store chain , but also the mail-order retailer quelle and the thomas cook travel company .
bankruptcy threat " there is no private economic solution .
there is no alternative to state aid , " arcandor ceo karl-gerhard eick told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .

furthermore , he warned , a bankruptcy could have an effect on suppliers and ulitmately it could be " a catastrophe for germany 's downtown shopping zones . "
cool response from politicians so far , politicians appear to be unmoved by the threats .
to date , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has reacted cautiously to the arcandor warnings .

furthermore , one of arcandor 's competitors , tengelmann , has loudly rejected the company 's bid for public funding .
in an interview with wirtschaftswoche magazine , tengelmann ceo karl-erivan haub said state aid for karstadt " would be a slap in the face for all the companies that had done a good management job " in the past .
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung newspaper has also raised the question of whether karstadt is n't simply stuck in financial turmoil of its own making .
the paper said suppliers had already recalled wares due to lack of payment , and that employee pay is only secured through may .
retailers suffering arcandor 's eick also rejected the idea of a recently discussed merger between karstadt and kaufhof , germany 's other major department store , saying it would be insufficient to prevent the collapse of arcandor .

the parent company of troubled german department store karstadt is warning that it could go bankrupt if the government does n't provide aid .
but competitors say such a move would be unfair . arcandor has stepped up pressure on the german government to lend it a helping hand .
in interviews over the weekend , the heads of arcandor and its karstadt department store unit warned that without taxpayer assistance to the tune of 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- some 50,000 jobs would be threatened .
arcandor runs not only the karstadt department store chain , but also the mail-order retailer quelle and the thomas cook travel company .
bankruptcy threat " there is no private economic solution .
there is no alternative to state aid , " arcandor ceo karl-gerhard eick told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
he repeated his demand for 650 million euros in loan guarantees and a 200-million-euro credit in saturday 's edition of the bild newspaper .
" without guarantees we have to find a new route , and that could include bankruptcy , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt rejects the idea of a kaufhof merger meanwhile , karstadt ceo stefan herzberg told the sunday edition of bild : " the lives of more than 50,000 workers could be disrupted . "
furthermore , he warned , a bankruptcy could have an effect on suppliers and ulitmately it could be " a catastrophe for germany 's downtown shopping zones . "
cool response from politicians so far , politicians appear to be unmoved by the threats .
to date , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has reacted cautiously to the arcandor warnings .
and volker kauder , a leading member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , rejected the notion of state aid for karstadt , noting that the firm was already in trouble before the current banking crisis began .
furthermore , one of arcandor 's competitors , tengelmann , has loudly rejected the company 's bid for public funding .
in an interview with wirtschaftswoche magazine , tengelmann ceo karl-erivan haub said state aid for karstadt " would be a slap in the face for all the companies that had done a good management job " in the past .
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung newspaper has also raised the question of whether karstadt is n't simply stuck in financial turmoil of its own making .
the paper said suppliers had already recalled wares due to lack of payment , and that employee pay is only secured through may .
retailers suffering arcandor 's eick also rejected the idea of a recently discussed merger between karstadt and kaufhof , germany 's other major department store , saying it would be insufficient to prevent the collapse of arcandor .
the merger is merely a poorly disguised attempt by kaufhof to drive karstadt into bankruptcy and to pick off individual karstadt department stores , according to eick .

the north conducted the test early on monday , detonating a bomb some 10 kilometers underground in the same area where it conducted an initial nuclear test in october , 2006 .
pyongyang test-fired three short-range , ground-to-air missiles later on monday from the site from which it launched a rocket last month , a south korean news agency reported , citing unnamed sources .
the eu 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , condemned the test , saying it further threatened peace and security in northeast asia .
" these irresponsible acts by north korea warrant a firm response by the international community .
the european union will be in contact with its partners to discuss appropriate measures , " solana said in a statement .
the czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he was " very much disturbed " by north korea 's announcement that it had " successfully " carried out a nuclear test .
british prime minister gordon brown described the decision to carry out the tests as " erroneous , misguided and a danger to the world " .
" this act will undermine prospects for peace on the korean peninsula and will do nothing for north korea 's security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 25.05.2009 north korea , burma overshadow ministers ' meeting in asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea 's test enraged the international community the asem meeting of foreign ministers from asia and europe opened in vietnam on monday .
the trial of burmese pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi , and north korea 's nuclear test crowded other issues off the agenda . two unexpected topics , from asia 's most secretive regimes , led the agenda on monday . instead of focusing on how to fight the economic crisis , or global warming , asem participants were up in arms over the trial of burmese pro-democracy activist aung san suu kyi , as well as the underground nuclear test by north korea on monday .
" the two hottest subjects on the agenda are these two problems , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country currently holds the european union presidency .
delegations from 45 asian and european countries are in hanoi , vietnam , for the ninth annual asia-europe meeting of foreign ministers , or asem .
representatives came from the european union , the association of southeast asian nations , china , japan , south korea , india and pakistan .
eu demands suu kyi 's release suu kyi is scheduled to testify on tuesday and is expected to deny that she broke the terms of her long-time house arrest after a protester from the us broke into her compound earlier this month .
the nobel peace prize winner could face five years in prison for the offense .
the eu repeated its demands for her release during a meeting with the burmese foreign minister , kohout said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is expected to complain about the trial of aung san suu kyi the eu would " clearly state its view of the necessity to release all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi , " eu external relations commissioner ferrero-waldner said .
the asem meeting had also been expected to make a reference to the north korean situation as part of its overall closing statement , but the nuclear detonation on monday , just as the conference opened , sent diplomats scrambling for a more forceful response .
north korea is not among the members of asem , a group that accounts for nearly 60 percent of the world 's population and 60 percent of global trade .
japan seeks statement on north korean test the japanese delegation pressed for asem to issue a separate statement on the test .
speaking at the conference , japanese ministry of foreign affairs spokesman kazuo kodama called the nuclear test " a grave threat to peace and stability . "

german business confidence rose in may for the second time in a row .
but observers say that the increase was less than forecast , and that the recession is far from over in germany . the munich-based ifo research institute said its closely-watched business-confidence index climbed to 84.2 points from 83.7 points in april .
this was the second increase in a row for the poll of 7,000 business leaders . but a reuters poll showed respondents had expected the index to increase to 85 points , and so reaction to the news was mixed .
mixed signal economists take the ifo reading as a serious measure of germany 's economic outlook .
some read the poll as a sign of a rosy future .
analyst joerg kraemer from commerzbank told reuters the measure was a " further clear signal that the plunging german economy is a thing of the past .
the recession is losing speed , and could be over by the autumn . "
' anemic ' improvement still , he warned that the coming improvements should n't be overestimated .
any improvements after that will be " anemic . "
other analysts saw the data in a less positive light .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.05.2009 voter apathy reflects lack of interest in eu affairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliamentary elections are a pretty dull affair the latest poll into who will vote in the upcoming european parliamentary elections on june 4-7 makes for some pretty grim reading .
it seems that voter apathy is growing as knowledge and interest in the eu shrink . a study carried out across the eu on behalf of the french political innovation foundation shows that 18 percent of those surveyed said they were ' not at all interested ' in the june poll , whilst 35 percent said they were ' rather not interested ' .
the same number said they were ' rather interested ' but only a meager 11 percent said they were ' very interested ' . the data coming in on voter apathy across the european union is turning unspoken but common knowledge into hard facts : the eu elections hold no interest for a huge number of the bloc 's citizens . what is less clear are the reasons why .
attempts have been made to connect the expected dramatically low turn-out with frustration over the incompetence of ministers , the mounting corruption scandals and the perceived idleness that voters associate with the overblown bureaucracy many believe the eu has become . but to equate the apparent refusal of so many europeans to head to the polls with an act of protest assumes that many people actually know or care what happens in brussels and strasbourg .
election experts believe it 's a lot simpler than that . " the european parliament is very important and the people who work there have an important role , but no-one has bothered to explain this to the voters , " professor mark franklin , chair of the european election studies steering group , told deutsche welle .
" it 's not clear what the european parliament does , it 's certainly not clear as to what difference it makes and it regularly throws up electoral lists full of unrecognizable names and faces .
it all adds up to the opinion that there 's no point to any of it . " boring election with no pay-off dr. hermann schmitt , project director at the mannheim center for european social research , told deutsche welle that he thought the lack of a tangible end product was turning voters off . " we know that people are disinterested , even to the degree that they don ’ t even know what 's going on , " he said .
" the main reason for this is that the european elections are seen to be quite unimportant .
this is because , in the european parliament election , the thing that characterizes a normal election is not going to happen – that is , a government is not going to be formed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are not immune from election lethargy " it 's not that people are staying away from these elections because they are critical of the european union and its political process ; it 's just that these elections are so boring and one does n't know why one should participate because not much is going to happen as a result of it , " he added . european parliamentary election turnout has fallen steadily from 66 percent in 1979 to just over 45 percent in 2004 , and in most member states is amongst the lowest for any form of poll . professor franklin is not surprised at all by the predicted voting figures .
he is , if anything , surprised that so many are saying that they intend to take part in this election . " the most amazing thing is that anyone votes at all , " he said .
" why would anyone vote in an election where they have no idea what 's at stake , what the issues are and what , if any , difference the election will have on their lives ?
that ’ s the case with all european elections . " three voting groups make up the numbers franklin believes that those who will vote will come from three groups which can always be relied upon to take part in elections .
these groups vote out of loyalty , habit or just because they want a change of pace . bildunterschrift : the greens traditionally benefit from expressive votes " we have the party loyalists who react to calls from their leaders to vote and save their party humiliation ; then there are those who vote out of habit , who generally believe that voting is a good thing and that they should exercise that right to vote , and then there are the expressive voters who tend to vote for parties , such as the greens , for whom they would n't normally vote in national elections , " he said . " these expressive votes usually come about because the voters know that it doesn ’ t matter who they vote for , because they think it wo n't matter anyway , it just gives them a chance to support someone different . " while eurocrats may be worried about keeping their jobs , a more serious concern is that the expected low turn-out could have unpleasant consequences for the make-up of the future parliament and the political spectrum in europe . lower turn-out plays into extremist hands the lower the turnout , the easier it will be for more radical parties to do well .
as in the 1930s , rising extremism is seen as a key potential risk from the financial crisis and resulting rise in unemployment and hardship . that could potentially see a rise both for far-left parties and right-wingers , including those angry at rising immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's extremist bnp could benefit from voter apathy anti-foreigner rhetoric , and in some cases violence , have increased in several countries in recent months .
analysts are watching the potential rise of the far-right in hungary and the nationalist british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , amongst others . " a low turn-out would certainly have implications in terms of niche or radical fringe parties , " professor franklin said .
" this is where the expressive voters come in .
they may make a choice to vote for a far-right or far-left party because of the reasons i gave before , that they believe that it wo n't make a difference .
they wouldn ’ t do this in national elections because it may have an impact , but in europe – who cares ? " what could happen , though , is that these extremist parties , for example an anti-eu party , may take seats away from others and then make the passing of legislation almost impossible , freezing the political process , " he added . franklin also believes that politics on a national level may suffer across europe as a result . eu elections could color the national voting experience " this european election experience may be the first time that around 50 percent of voters in the eu vote for the first time , " he said .
" if this is their first experience of an electoral vote , imagine what that can do to their opinion of the democratic process !
the next time there 's a national vote , the domestic parties may say , ' those eu elections were n't that important but these ones are ' – but by then an opinion is already starting to form that all elections are pointless , especially among young voters .
this is one of the reasons why national turn-outs are also on the wane across europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign fight involving barroso might excite voters both franklin and schmitt say that a change in the process where electable figureheads are campaigning for office – be it the president of the commission or a future european president – could help encourage people to vote in european elections . " if the parliament would elect the president of the commission and two or three competing candidates would run in these elections , things would be different and turn-out would increase , " schmitt said .
" elections are about horse races , elections are about who is going to govern , elections are about people and faces and whether you like them or you do n't . " a real race - but who would want to run ? " to make the european elections more attractive , the process could include a number of presidential candidates who are running against each other , " franklin said .
" then there will be other politicians who will stand and say ' i support such and such because of this and that ' .
we might then get a debate about what these people intend to do .
it will be a real election with electable faces and personalities . " however , franklin believes that turning european elections into a sexy presidential race will probably not happen any time soon . " someone once said that electing a european president would relegate people , like the president of france , into a role no more important than the governor of texas , " he said .
" real elections for a european president would make national leaders even less relevant , and which politician would want that ? " author : nick amies editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the leader of the democratic party and two-time former prime minister , tsakhiagiin elbegdorj , had campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket .
incumbent president nambaryn enkhbayar - of the former communist party - admitted a " narrow " defeat .
official results are yet to be released .
the election campaign was dominated by the issue of distributing the country 's vast mineral wealth .
president nambaryn enkhbayar admitted defeat in sunday 's poll , saying he respected the result , according to chinese state media .
he said that , according to parties ' counting of the votes , tsakhiagiin elbegdorj - his only rival in the election - had won a narrow victory .
mongolian media are also reporting that mr elbegdorj has won .
widespread poverty speaking earlier , the democratic party chairman told supporters that mongolia was " meeting a new morning , with a new president " .
the bbc 's quentin sommerville in beijing says there were fears that a close result could lead to civil unrest .
allegations of vote rigging during last year 's parliamentary poll sparked protests in which five people died and hundreds were hurt .
reports from the capital ulan bator say that the streets are calm but police and troops are on stand-by in case of trouble .
in 1990 , mongolia abandoned its 70-year-old soviet-style one-party state and embraced political and economic reforms .
