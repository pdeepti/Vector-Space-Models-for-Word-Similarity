program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 01.02.2009 german government fails to agree on proposed environmental law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-activists fear the consequences of the failed law a law aimed at streamlining germany 's environmental legislation - one of the coalition government 's core projects - will not be adopted in the current legislative period , said the german environment minister . " germany will still have no straightforward , transparent and unbureaucratic environmental law in one piece , " environment minister sigmar gabriel said in a statement on sunday .
" the existing fragmentation will remain in place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister gabriel has blamed his coalition partners each of germany 's 16 states has its own set of regulations on issues such as pollution , which makes the approval process for firms planning new projects like roads or factories highly bureaucratic and complex .
the environment minister , of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , was critical of the internal political wranglings inherent to the process by which individual state approval is sought for proposals to pass .
bavaria , led by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- sister party of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ultimately did n't approve the draft law , criticizing it for adding another layer of bureaucracy for companies seeking environmental certification .
the project failed " due to a hollow lack of reform and blind blocking policies of the union , " gabriel said .
states are in charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel proposed a new set of regulations two decades ago in the 1980s , a decision was made to try and simplify the country 's environmental regulations .
in 1997 , then environment minister angela merkel - now chancellor - proposed a new , one-size-fits-all set of regulations to speed things up .
when merkel 's conservatives and the social democrats formed the ruling " grand coalition " in 2005 , it was something both parties promised they would make happen .
the government was also hoping that less red tape would help speed up the billions of euros worth of infrastructure projects with which berlin aims to pull europe 's biggest economy out of its worst post-war recession .
party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2009 parliamentary elections pose a major problem for the coalition government with seven months to go before general elections - when both parties aim to ditch the other and form a coalition with another party - gabriel said that the agreement was impossible in the current legislative period .
gabriel , who is from the spd , said that with a lack of readiness to compromise the cdu / csu - which in turn blamed gabriel - was " damaging the economy and the environment at the same time . "
the german branch of friends of the earth , bund , said there was now a danger of a " race to the bottom " among german states to relax environmental regulations in order to attract investment . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one young , religious german family has left their homeland for the united states so that they could teach their children as they see fit . for damaris , christian , josua , lydia and daniel romeike , a school day starts at the table with their father reading the bible to them - in english then explaining the words and expressions in german . uwe and hannelore romeike are educating their children , aged 3 to 11 , at home .
that 's illegal in germany , so last august they moved to a small town in the us state of tennessee . germany is one of the few countries in europe not to allow home education .
sometimes german authorities turn a blind eye toward parents who teach their children themselves , but the romeikes say they had no choice but to move abroad after authorities came to their home to enforce the law . " the police were knocking at the door , and one day they took the children to school , and the children were crying because the policemen took the schoolbags by force , " uwe romeike told dw-radio .
" they were really rude - especially to my wife . " in addition to noticing daniel and lydia become quiet and more prone to crying for the few years they attended a german school , the deeply religious romeikes say they objected to the content of the instruction their children received . " we noticed that the school books always reflect certain values , that education can not be neutral , " hannelore romeike said .
" we communicate our values , the teachers communicate theirs , and if the kids are at school , we can not have an influence on what they learn . " at home , the romeikes decide which books the children read and which lessons they learn .
they do not let their children read harry potter novels , for instance , because they are about witchcraft and the occult . but parents who maintain an influence on what their children learn by ignoring german rules on mandatory school education can face hefty fines and even jail sentences .
that 's why the family now hopes that their application for political asylum will be successful and that they will be granted permanent residence and work permits in the united states . controversial option bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the romeikes are hoping to start a new life in tennessee the romeikes have a well-organized support network that centers around the home school legal defense association -lrb- hslda -rrb- , which supports their application for asylum . the united states offers political asylum to people who have a well-founded fear of persecution for being a member of a religious , political or social group if they were to return to their home country , according to hslda staff council mike donnelly . " we believe that homeschoolers in germany represent a social group and so we think that they definitely have a fear of persecution because the fines -lsb- can be -rsb- anywhere from a 1,000 up to 50,000 euros , " donnelly said .
" they threaten parents with custody actions by getting the family court involved and they also threaten them with prison . " in 2007 , an estimated 1.5 million children in the us - equal to 2.9 percent of the school-age population - were educated at home , according to a december 2008 report from the us national center for education statistics .
the national home education research institute puts the number of home schooled pupils at over 2 million . providing religious or moral instruction was the most important reason why parents chose to home school their children with concerns about the school environment placing second , the nces report said . home schooling proponents point to studies showing home schooled students perform better on standardized tests and have high college attendance rates .
opponents , however , doubt the studies are representative of all home schooled students and have called for some state oversight of the practice . christina bergmann / dw staff -lrb- jc / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one young , religious german family has left their homeland for the united states so that they could teach their children as they see fit . for damaris , christian , josua , lydia and daniel romeike , a school day starts at the table with their father reading the bible to them - in english then explaining the words and expressions in german . uwe and hannelore romeike are educating their children , aged 3 to 11 , at home .
that 's illegal in germany , so last august they moved to a small town in the us state of tennessee . germany is one of the few countries in europe not to allow home education .
sometimes german authorities turn a blind eye toward parents who teach their children themselves , but the romeikes say they had no choice but to move abroad after authorities came to their home to enforce the law . " the police were knocking at the door , and one day they took the children to school , and the children were crying because the policemen took the schoolbags by force , " uwe romeike told dw-radio .
" they were really rude - especially to my wife . " in addition to noticing daniel and lydia become quiet and more prone to crying for the few years they attended a german school , the deeply religious romeikes say they objected to the content of the instruction their children received . " we noticed that the school books always reflect certain values , that education can not be neutral , " hannelore romeike said .
" we communicate our values , the teachers communicate theirs , and if the kids are at school , we can not have an influence on what they learn . " at home , the romeikes decide which books the children read and which lessons they learn .
they do not let their children read harry potter novels , for instance , because they are about witchcraft and the occult . but parents who maintain an influence on what their children learn by ignoring german rules on mandatory school education can face hefty fines and even jail sentences .

" we believe that homeschoolers in germany represent a social group and so we think that they definitely have a fear of persecution because the fines -lsb- can be -rsb- anywhere from a 1,000 up to 50,000 euros , " donnelly said .
" they threaten parents with custody actions by getting the family court involved and they also threaten them with prison . " in 2007 , an estimated 1.5 million children in the us - equal to 2.9 percent of the school-age population - were educated at home , according to a december 2008 report from the us national center for education statistics .
the national home education research institute puts the number of home schooled pupils at over 2 million . providing religious or moral instruction was the most important reason why parents chose to home school their children with concerns about the school environment placing second , the nces report said . home schooling proponents point to studies showing home schooled students perform better on standardized tests and have high college attendance rates .

" we will start a global redesign initiative in next few weeks , " schwab said in an impromptu statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab says the overhaul of the global financial system will take time " it has the support of almost every political leader who was here " at davos in the past five days , said schwab , naming specifically un secretary general ban ki-moon and chinese prime minister wen jiabao as backers .
he said the upcoming meeting in april of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- would not be enough to solve the global economic crisis .
" it wo n't address the totality of the issues , " schwab said , adding it could at best deal with " technical " matters .
he said there needed to be a systemic redesign of the global banking system , financial regulation and corporate governance .
" the key is global cooperation , " schwab stated later , " not only among government but among all the stakeholders of our society . "
what happened at davos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davos is the world 's foremost gathering of business and government leaders the world economic forum for 2009 ended with many asking what was really accomplished during the five days many of the world 's political and economic leaders gathered in the frigid swiss village of davos .
in his concluding remarks at the end of an engaging session on the future of the economy with key economic players , the journalist martin wolf summed up many people 's thought by saying that while no one knew exactly what needed to be done , something needed to be done and fast .
it was also apparent that things were - in the mantra of our times - about to change .
the financial and economic systems would look different , more regulated and controlled , and with better governance .
while people would still get rich , the scale of wealth would diminish .
fitting for what britain 's gordon brown termed the first crisis of the global era , the importance of international institutions and global cooperation were emphasized as key components to getting the world out of the economic downturn .
blaming the bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalists see davos as part of the problem there was anger at the bankers and the inventors of the complex derivatives that helped lead the world into the crisis and upset that the governments were being reactive and moving too slowly .
but some felt there was a unique chance for change and build a better system of economics , in part based on the concept of a " green economy , " just in time for the international meeting at the end of the year when countries will try to agree on an aggressive global environmental convention .

" we will start a global redesign initiative in next few weeks , " schwab said in an impromptu statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab says the overhaul of the global financial system will take time " it has the support of almost every political leader who was here " at davos in the past five days , said schwab , naming specifically un secretary general ban ki-moon and chinese prime minister wen jiabao as backers .
he said the upcoming meeting in april of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- would not be enough to solve the global economic crisis .
" it wo n't address the totality of the issues , " schwab said , adding it could at best deal with " technical " matters .
he said there needed to be a systemic redesign of the global banking system , financial regulation and corporate governance .
" the key is global cooperation , " schwab stated later , " not only among government but among all the stakeholders of our society . "
what happened at davos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davos is the world 's foremost gathering of business and government leaders the world economic forum for 2009 ended with many asking what was really accomplished during the five days many of the world 's political and economic leaders gathered in the frigid swiss village of davos .
in his concluding remarks at the end of an engaging session on the future of the economy with key economic players , the journalist martin wolf summed up many people 's thought by saying that while no one knew exactly what needed to be done , something needed to be done and fast .
it was also apparent that things were - in the mantra of our times - about to change .
the financial and economic systems would look different , more regulated and controlled , and with better governance .
while people would still get rich , the scale of wealth would diminish .
fitting for what britain 's gordon brown termed the first crisis of the global era , the importance of international institutions and global cooperation were emphasized as key components to getting the world out of the economic downturn .
blaming the bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalists see davos as part of the problem there was anger at the bankers and the inventors of the complex derivatives that helped lead the world into the crisis and upset that the governments were being reactive and moving too slowly .

hoffenheim did not slip up in their new environment on a return to league action after the seven-week winter break despite having league top scorer vedad ibisevic out injured for the rest of the season , chinedu obasi also sidelined and carlos eduardo suspended .
" it was very important to win the first game in the new stadium and to have a successful start into the second half of the season , " said captain selim teber .
the win sees hoffenheim move two points clear of hertha berlin and sv hamburg , who 24 hours at the top as mladen petric 's header the previous night ensured a 1-0 win over champions bayern munich in the official league restart .
" maybe we thought after the good game -lrb- tuesday 's 5-1 cup triumph at vfb stuttgart -rrb- that we would only require a half-hearted effort .
but you ca n't afford that against any team , and definitely not against hamburg , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
hoffenheim ahead by a nose hoffenheim top the table with 38 points , hertha berlin and hamburg have 36 each and munich are now fourth on 35 .
hertha defeated eintracht frankfurt 2-1 on saturday .
hoffenheim were in command against drop-zone club cottbus from the start and ba slotted home the 1-0 lead in the 28th as two defenders failed to clear his original header .
the werder bremen import sanogo wasted a first chance in the 36th but did better in the 63rd with a short-range volley for 2-0 as cottbus protested in vain that he had pushed a defender before scoring .
hoffenheim goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who returned to germany in the winter break after being released by valencia , suffered a thigh injury and had to be replaced by daniel haas during the second half .
hertha remained close to the top courtesy of a double from controversial forward marko pantelic in snowy conditions .

schalke 04 's ambition to overcome a poor first half of the season ended in defeat , 1-0 at hanover 96 from sergio pinto 's blast eight minutes into the game .
schalke wasted a host of first-rate chances as they trail hoffenheim by 11 points in mid-table .
fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who on saturday hired bayern munich teenager toni kroos on loan , drew 1-1 at borussia dortmund .

but there were few signs that a sideline meeting saturday of trade ministers from about 20 countries had managed to push ahead the long-stalled doha round of trade talks , meant to create freer markets .
" throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not right , " said world trade organization director general pascal lamy .
" trade is not the cause of crisis . "
the concerns over protectionism - measures such as tariffs which would place restrains on trade - were sparked by the harsh reminders that isolationist policies in response to the market crash of 1929 wreaked havoc and in part created the harshness of the great depression .
nations could take steps to protect their industries , but protectionism distorts markets , said lamy , adding that he would monitor legislation in various countries which might violate wto rules .
he urged the us senate to be careful when it voted on a stimulus bill , already passed in the house of representatives , which did contain some " buy american " elements .
with the international monetary fund predicting the weakest year of growth since the second world war , there was real concern over measures which might impede commerce needed to get the world economy out of the downturn .
warning of social unrest france 's finance minister christine lagarde said the two greatest concerns were social unrest and protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .
several politicians openly stated they were under pressure from businesses at home to take big steps towards protecting local enterprises .
at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .
many hopes were pinned on the upcoming meeting of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- in april in london , with expectations that the major emerging economies will have to be part of a solution in such a global crisis .
there were repeated calls , from indian to british officials , to take steps to boost the imf and other international institutions .
japan said it was ready to give 1 $ 00 billion to the fund , which itself has asked for $ 250 billion .
however , it was clear most leaders did not feel there was a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the problems and each state would have to take right steps for its economy .
an era of humility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton said making less money could be a good thing no one was willing to predict when the crisis would end , or even bottom out .
the optimists would only say that eventually things would work out , though changes would be made .
" people will still make money but not like in past decade , and that 's a good thing , " said former us president bill clinton .
regulation would likely get tougher both on existing banks and all financial institutions .
" if it walks as a bank and quacks like a bank it needs to be regulated like a bank , " said peter sands of britain 's standard chartered bank .
several business leaders said they were simply waiting for the proverbial other shoe to fall , such as when it became clear how badly hedge funds were affected .
the financial world was entering , in the words of a private investor , " a new era of humility . "
but for the already humbled , the world 's poorest or " bottom billion " people , times might get tougher as they will lack both the capital and the credit to stimulate their economies , while the industries they depend on are likely to be hard hit .
a vulnerability fund world bank president robert zoellick suggested that the industrialized world should put aside 0.7 per cent of their stimulus packages for a " vulnerability fund " for developing countries suffering in the global downturn .
he urged against leaving the weakest " out in the cold . "

like others , he also said an eye should be kept on the ball in regards to climate change , particularly with countries set to gather at the end of the year in an attempt to pass an aggressive environmental accord .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .
several politicians openly stated they were under pressure from businesses at home to take big steps towards protecting local enterprises .
at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .
many hopes were pinned on the upcoming meeting of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- in april in london , with expectations that the major emerging economies will have to be part of a solution in such a global crisis .
there were repeated calls , from indian to british officials , to take steps to boost the imf and other international institutions .
japan said it was ready to give 1 $ 00 billion to the fund , which itself has asked for $ 250 billion .
however , it was clear most leaders did not feel there was a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the problems and each state would have to take right steps for its economy .
an era of humility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton said making less money could be a good thing no one was willing to predict when the crisis would end , or even bottom out .
the optimists would only say that eventually things would work out , though changes would be made .
" people will still make money but not like in past decade , and that 's a good thing , " said former us president bill clinton .
regulation would likely get tougher both on existing banks and all financial institutions .
" if it walks as a bank and quacks like a bank it needs to be regulated like a bank , " said peter sands of britain 's standard chartered bank .
several business leaders said they were simply waiting for the proverbial other shoe to fall , such as when it became clear how badly hedge funds were affected .
the financial world was entering , in the words of a private investor , " a new era of humility . "
but for the already humbled , the world 's poorest or " bottom billion " people , times might get tougher as they will lack both the capital and the credit to stimulate their economies , while the industries they depend on are likely to be hard hit .
a vulnerability fund world bank president robert zoellick suggested that the industrialized world should put aside 0.7 per cent of their stimulus packages for a " vulnerability fund " for developing countries suffering in the global downturn .
he urged against leaving the weakest " out in the cold . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon urged for aid for the developing world to be maintained similarly , ban ki-moon , the un 's secretary general , called for maintaining aid to the developing world , even in times of crisis .
like others , he also said an eye should be kept on the ball in regards to climate change , particularly with countries set to gather at the end of the year in an attempt to pass an aggressive environmental accord .
if the economy were to " go green , " jobs could be created , spurring some recovery , many leaders including ban noted . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge certainly , there were enough suggestions : german chancellor angela merkel advocated the creation of an international economic council as the new controlling body , which - just like the security council - would be residing at the united nations .
economists nouriel roubini and nassim taleb - famous for their pessimistic but accurate forecasts - demanded the full privatization of banks .
and british prime minister gordon brown spoke up , like several other participants , in favor of strengthening the world bank and the international monetary fund .
but the question of how these ideas should be practically implemented and how long this would take remained unanswered .
and that for a good reason : many propositions contradicted each other , either in parts or fully .
this made the most important element of any solution for the world economic crisis - a global consensus on the methods - impossible to reach .
one should , nevertheless , consider the world economic forum a success .
seeing managers and politicians discussing issues and fighting each other , witnessing business bosses and ministers trying to get a grip on the roots and development of the crisis , and sensing the uncertainty of the elites about the future , one could only conclude : the time for solutions was not yet ripe .
instead of adopting a master plan with concrete steps for the future , davos delegates had systematic analysis , collective wound-licking and mutual soul-massage as the order of the day .
for the first time since the beginning of the crisis , business and political leaders could thoroughly share and exchange opinions with one another in the midst of the swiss alps .
in a certain way , the world economic forum functioned as a global psycho-couch .
that may not be satisfactory from the point of few of the people all over the world who are suffering from the economic crisis .
but without accepting and coming to terms with a crisis - that 's what any wanna-be psychologist will tell you - no breakthrough will be possible .
if an important part of getting to understand and evaluate the crisis took part in davos , then the world economic forum was a success .
a breakthrough would have to happen at the latest at the london g-20 summit in april .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 01.02.2009 criticism of pope 's rehabilitation of holocaust denier grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope is coming under increasing fire from within the catholic church over his policies a second german catholic bishop saturday raised unusual criticism of german pope benedict xvi for rehabilitating holocaust denier bishop williamson , adding his objections to the pope 's ultraconservative direction . bishop gebhard fuerst of rottenburg-stuttgart criticized as " totally unacceptable " remarks by bishop richard williamson in recent weeks that there was no historical evidence for the holocaust .
in a public declaration , fuerst charged that benedict 's rehabilitation of williamson had led to " external and internal alienation from the church on the part of many believers , to a betrayal of trust especially among jewish sisters and brothers in their relationship to the church , and to a considerable disturbance in the christian-jewish dialogue . "
to end a schism with ultraconservatives , rome last week lifted its excommunication of four men who ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- outside the church for more than 20 years .
british-born williamson , who runs a seminary in argentina , was one of them .
in related developments on saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican and the pope named an ultraconservative austrian priest as bishop in linz .
williamson being shunned by colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson could face criminal charges in germany earlier this week , gerhard ludwig mueller , the catholic bishop of the german city of regensburg which is also the pope 's home city , declared williamson persona-non-grata in his district .
williamson has denied the holocaust in recent weeks in germany and sweden .
public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany .
bishop fuerst called the pardoning of williamson " a heavy burden for me as bishop and as spiritual pastor . "
fuerst charged that the rehabilitation of all four priests undermined the " precious " unity of the church , the upholding of which was among the " highest obligations of the pope and the bishops . "
the four priests have defied changes made in the church after the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- which , among other things , loosened strict adherence to latin as the language of worship and started the ecumenical outreach to other christian churches and other religions .
by denying the council and being rehabilitated , the priests were threatening church unity , fuerst said .
" the price of such denial is that many believers will internally or externally turn away , " fuerst said .
" without exception , the theology and pastorals of our diocese , for which i am responsible as bishop , are and remain the legacy of the second vatican council and its central directives , " fuerst said .
" the desire for real unity must come from cooperation .
whoever belongs to the church may not question the basic concepts of the council . "
israel threatens suspension of rleationship with vatican bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is said to be outraged by the pope 's decision earlier saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs , yitzhak cohen , threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican following the pope 's pardoning of williamson , german news magazine spiegel reported saturday .
cohen said he recommended " completely cutting off connections to a body in which holocaust deniers and anti-semites are members . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on january 27 .
academic renounces catholic membership in protest following on from bishop fuerst 's criticism , a philosophy and ethics professor at radboud university of nijmegen , until 2004 formally a catholic university , has formally renounced his membership of the catholic church to protest the rehabilitation of the sspx . in an interview for dutch catholic internet magazine katholiek nederland , belgian-born jean-pierre wils said he refuses to associate himself any further with the church 's " anti-modern , anti-pluralistic and totalitarian " attitude . wils said he made his decision after rome revoked on january 24 the 1988 excommunication of the four clerics , who led the breakaway , ultra-traditionalist catholic group which accents prayer in latin and opposition to jewish beliefs . in the interview , professor wils , who lives in germany but teaches at the university in the south-east netherlands , called the sspx an " extremely reactionary and deeply anti-semitic " group that " sympathizes with dictators and fundamentalist rightist extremists . " according to the scholar , the sspx bishops claim jews and freemasons manipulated the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- . one of the second vatican council 's most heavily debated documents was the nostra aetate , in which the church renounced its traditional approach that all jews , including contemporary jews , were responsible for the jesus ' death . the second vatican council also lifted the obligation for all catholics to actively convert jews .
austrian catholics criticize appointment meanwhile , catholic priests in austria on sunday criticized the vatican for naming an ultraconservative priest as auxiliary bishop in linz on saturday without having consulted the local church . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has made headlines in the past when he condemned jk rowling 's harry potter books for its " satanist " content . he also suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was god 's punishment , as it destroyed five abortion clinics as well as nightclubs in new orleans . " i am not very happy about this , since i get the general impression that there was no attempt to communicate with the diocese , " hans padinger , spokesman of the priests in linz , told austrian broadcaster orf . the town of linz is the seat of one of austria 's seven dioceses , or territorial units of the catholic church . franz wild was one priest who voiced even sharper criticism .
" i am shocked by this decision , " he told the regional paper oberoesterreichische rundschau . " i hope the church realizes that we live in the 21st century and that the church must live in that period , too , " he said . a significant portion of austrian catholics see themselves as more liberal than the vatican , opposing rome 's views on abortion , homosexuality or the ban on married priests . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a public declaration , fuerst charged that benedict 's rehabilitation of williamson had led to " external and internal alienation from the church on the part of many believers , to a betrayal of trust especially among jewish sisters and brothers in their relationship to the church , and to a considerable disturbance in the christian-jewish dialogue . "
to end a schism with ultraconservatives , rome last week lifted its excommunication of four men who ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- outside the church for more than 20 years .
british-born williamson , who runs a seminary in argentina , was one of them .
in related developments on saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican and the pope named an ultraconservative austrian priest as bishop in linz .
williamson being shunned by colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson could face criminal charges in germany earlier this week , gerhard ludwig mueller , the catholic bishop of the german city of regensburg which is also the pope 's home city , declared williamson persona-non-grata in his district .
williamson has denied the holocaust in recent weeks in germany and sweden .
public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany .
bishop fuerst called the pardoning of williamson " a heavy burden for me as bishop and as spiritual pastor . "
fuerst charged that the rehabilitation of all four priests undermined the " precious " unity of the church , the upholding of which was among the " highest obligations of the pope and the bishops . "
the four priests have defied changes made in the church after the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- which , among other things , loosened strict adherence to latin as the language of worship and started the ecumenical outreach to other christian churches and other religions .
by denying the council and being rehabilitated , the priests were threatening church unity , fuerst said .
" the price of such denial is that many believers will internally or externally turn away , " fuerst said .
" without exception , the theology and pastorals of our diocese , for which i am responsible as bishop , are and remain the legacy of the second vatican council and its central directives , " fuerst said .
" the desire for real unity must come from cooperation .
whoever belongs to the church may not question the basic concepts of the council . "
israel threatens suspension of rleationship with vatican bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is said to be outraged by the pope 's decision earlier saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs , yitzhak cohen , threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican following the pope 's pardoning of williamson , german news magazine spiegel reported saturday .
cohen said he recommended " completely cutting off connections to a body in which holocaust deniers and anti-semites are members . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on january 27 .
academic renounces catholic membership in protest following on from bishop fuerst 's criticism , a philosophy and ethics professor at radboud university of nijmegen , until 2004 formally a catholic university , has formally renounced his membership of the catholic church to protest the rehabilitation of the sspx . in an interview for dutch catholic internet magazine katholiek nederland , belgian-born jean-pierre wils said he refuses to associate himself any further with the church 's " anti-modern , anti-pluralistic and totalitarian " attitude . wils said he made his decision after rome revoked on january 24 the 1988 excommunication of the four clerics , who led the breakaway , ultra-traditionalist catholic group which accents prayer in latin and opposition to jewish beliefs . in the interview , professor wils , who lives in germany but teaches at the university in the south-east netherlands , called the sspx an " extremely reactionary and deeply anti-semitic " group that " sympathizes with dictators and fundamentalist rightist extremists . " according to the scholar , the sspx bishops claim jews and freemasons manipulated the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- . one of the second vatican council 's most heavily debated documents was the nostra aetate , in which the church renounced its traditional approach that all jews , including contemporary jews , were responsible for the jesus ' death . the second vatican council also lifted the obligation for all catholics to actively convert jews .
austrian catholics criticize appointment meanwhile , catholic priests in austria on sunday criticized the vatican for naming an ultraconservative priest as auxiliary bishop in linz on saturday without having consulted the local church . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has made headlines in the past when he condemned jk rowling 's harry potter books for its " satanist " content . he also suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was god 's punishment , as it destroyed five abortion clinics as well as nightclubs in new orleans . " i am not very happy about this , since i get the general impression that there was no attempt to communicate with the diocese , " hans padinger , spokesman of the priests in linz , told austrian broadcaster orf . the town of linz is the seat of one of austria 's seven dioceses , or territorial units of the catholic church . franz wild was one priest who voiced even sharper criticism .
" i am shocked by this decision , " he told the regional paper oberoesterreichische rundschau . " i hope the church realizes that we live in the 21st century and that the church must live in that period , too , " he said . a significant portion of austrian catholics see themselves as more liberal than the vatican , opposing rome 's views on abortion , homosexuality or the ban on married priests . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a public declaration , fuerst charged that benedict 's rehabilitation of williamson had led to " external and internal alienation from the church on the part of many believers , to a betrayal of trust especially among jewish sisters and brothers in their relationship to the church , and to a considerable disturbance in the christian-jewish dialogue . "
to end a schism with ultraconservatives , rome last week lifted its excommunication of four men who ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- outside the church for more than 20 years .
british-born williamson , who runs a seminary in argentina , was one of them .
in related developments on saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican and the pope named an ultraconservative austrian priest as bishop in linz .
williamson being shunned by colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson could face criminal charges in germany earlier this week , gerhard ludwig mueller , the catholic bishop of the german city of regensburg which is also the pope 's home city , declared williamson persona-non-grata in his district .
williamson has denied the holocaust in recent weeks in germany and sweden .
public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany .
bishop fuerst called the pardoning of williamson " a heavy burden for me as bishop and as spiritual pastor . "
fuerst charged that the rehabilitation of all four priests undermined the " precious " unity of the church , the upholding of which was among the " highest obligations of the pope and the bishops . "
the four priests have defied changes made in the church after the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- which , among other things , loosened strict adherence to latin as the language of worship and started the ecumenical outreach to other christian churches and other religions .
by denying the council and being rehabilitated , the priests were threatening church unity , fuerst said .
" the price of such denial is that many believers will internally or externally turn away , " fuerst said .
" without exception , the theology and pastorals of our diocese , for which i am responsible as bishop , are and remain the legacy of the second vatican council and its central directives , " fuerst said .
" the desire for real unity must come from cooperation .
whoever belongs to the church may not question the basic concepts of the council . "
israel threatens suspension of rleationship with vatican bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is said to be outraged by the pope 's decision earlier saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs , yitzhak cohen , threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican following the pope 's pardoning of williamson , german news magazine spiegel reported saturday .
cohen said he recommended " completely cutting off connections to a body in which holocaust deniers and anti-semites are members . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on january 27 .

hoffenheim did not slip up in their new environment on a return to league action after the seven-week winter break despite having league top scorer vedad ibisevic out injured for the rest of the season , chinedu obasi also sidelined and carlos eduardo suspended .
" it was very important to win the first game in the new stadium and to have a successful start into the second half of the season , " said captain selim teber .
the win sees hoffenheim move two points clear of hertha berlin and sv hamburg , who 24 hours at the top as mladen petric 's header the previous night ensured a 1-0 win over champions bayern munich in the official league restart .
" maybe we thought after the good game -lrb- tuesday 's 5-1 cup triumph at vfb stuttgart -rrb- that we would only require a half-hearted effort .
but you ca n't afford that against any team , and definitely not against hamburg , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
hoffenheim ahead by a nose hoffenheim top the table with 38 points , hertha berlin and hamburg have 36 each and munich are now fourth on 35 .
hertha defeated eintracht frankfurt 2-1 on saturday .
hoffenheim were in command against drop-zone club cottbus from the start and ba slotted home the 1-0 lead in the 28th as two defenders failed to clear his original header .
the werder bremen import sanogo wasted a first chance in the 36th but did better in the 63rd with a short-range volley for 2-0 as cottbus protested in vain that he had pushed a defender before scoring .
hoffenheim goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who returned to germany in the winter break after being released by valencia , suffered a thigh injury and had to be replaced by daniel haas during the second half .
hertha remained close to the top courtesy of a double from controversial forward marko pantelic in snowy conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic continues his fine form to keep herta in the race the serbian poked home in a goalmouth scramble in the 17th minute and got his second in the 51st .

schalke 04 's ambition to overcome a poor first half of the season ended in defeat , 1-0 at hanover 96 from sergio pinto 's blast eight minutes into the game .
schalke wasted a host of first-rate chances as they trail hoffenheim by 11 points in mid-table .
fifth-placed bayer leverkusen , who on saturday hired bayern munich teenager toni kroos on loan , drew 1-1 at borussia dortmund .

but there were few signs that a sideline meeting saturday of trade ministers from about 20 countries had managed to push ahead the long-stalled doha round of trade talks , meant to create freer markets .
" throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not right , " said world trade organization director general pascal lamy .
" trade is not the cause of crisis . "
the concerns over protectionism - measures such as tariffs which would place restrains on trade - were sparked by the harsh reminders that isolationist policies in response to the market crash of 1929 wreaked havoc and in part created the harshness of the great depression .
nations could take steps to protect their industries , but protectionism distorts markets , said lamy , adding that he would monitor legislation in various countries which might violate wto rules .
he urged the us senate to be careful when it voted on a stimulus bill , already passed in the house of representatives , which did contain some " buy american " elements .
with the international monetary fund predicting the weakest year of growth since the second world war , there was real concern over measures which might impede commerce needed to get the world economy out of the downturn .
warning of social unrest france 's finance minister christine lagarde said the two greatest concerns were social unrest and protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .
several politicians openly stated they were under pressure from businesses at home to take big steps towards protecting local enterprises .
at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .
many hopes were pinned on the upcoming meeting of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- in april in london , with expectations that the major emerging economies will have to be part of a solution in such a global crisis .
there were repeated calls , from indian to british officials , to take steps to boost the imf and other international institutions .
japan said it was ready to give 1 $ 00 billion to the fund , which itself has asked for $ 250 billion .
however , it was clear most leaders did not feel there was a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the problems and each state would have to take right steps for its economy .
an era of humility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton said making less money could be a good thing no one was willing to predict when the crisis would end , or even bottom out .
the optimists would only say that eventually things would work out , though changes would be made .
" people will still make money but not like in past decade , and that 's a good thing , " said former us president bill clinton .
regulation would likely get tougher both on existing banks and all financial institutions .
" if it walks as a bank and quacks like a bank it needs to be regulated like a bank , " said peter sands of britain 's standard chartered bank .
several business leaders said they were simply waiting for the proverbial other shoe to fall , such as when it became clear how badly hedge funds were affected .
the financial world was entering , in the words of a private investor , " a new era of humility . "
but for the already humbled , the world 's poorest or " bottom billion " people , times might get tougher as they will lack both the capital and the credit to stimulate their economies , while the industries they depend on are likely to be hard hit .
a vulnerability fund world bank president robert zoellick suggested that the industrialized world should put aside 0.7 per cent of their stimulus packages for a " vulnerability fund " for developing countries suffering in the global downturn .
he urged against leaving the weakest " out in the cold . "

like others , he also said an eye should be kept on the ball in regards to climate change , particularly with countries set to gather at the end of the year in an attempt to pass an aggressive environmental accord .

but there were few signs that a sideline meeting saturday of trade ministers from about 20 countries had managed to push ahead the long-stalled doha round of trade talks , meant to create freer markets .
" throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not right , " said world trade organization director general pascal lamy .
" trade is not the cause of crisis . "
the concerns over protectionism - measures such as tariffs which would place restrains on trade - were sparked by the harsh reminders that isolationist policies in response to the market crash of 1929 wreaked havoc and in part created the harshness of the great depression .
nations could take steps to protect their industries , but protectionism distorts markets , said lamy , adding that he would monitor legislation in various countries which might violate wto rules .
he urged the us senate to be careful when it voted on a stimulus bill , already passed in the house of representatives , which did contain some " buy american " elements .
with the international monetary fund predicting the weakest year of growth since the second world war , there was real concern over measures which might impede commerce needed to get the world economy out of the downturn .
warning of social unrest france 's finance minister christine lagarde said the two greatest concerns were social unrest and protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .
several politicians openly stated they were under pressure from businesses at home to take big steps towards protecting local enterprises .
at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .

the lesion from the blow was just below the arrow strike .

now , they 've concluded that he died shortly after being shot with a flint-tipped arrow . " he only lived for a short time after the arrow impact , " said andreas nerlich , who headed a joint study by the ludwig maximilians university of munich and experts from bolzano , italy . shortly before he was shot in the back , the iceman suffered a non-lethal blow with a blunt object , possibly a stone from a slingshot , nerlich 's team said in a letter to the online journal intensive care medicine . explaining the death 5,000 years ago of the hunter has challenged some of the world 's best scientists . precise timeline established the team around nerlich studied chemical changes in living tissue to establish how long each of oetzi 's injuries happened before his death in the snow of the oetztal glacier in italy 's south tyrol region . they said their findings , using new immunohistochemical techniques , of a fatal shot in the back supported the hypothesis that oetzi was being chased at the time he was killed .
the lesion from the blow was just below the arrow strike . " we 're now able to provide information about the age and sequence of wounds , " said nerlich in munich . a deep cut in the iceman 's hand , which has already been studied in the past , happened several days earlier , possibly in an accident with his flint knife .

" we will start a global redesign initiative in next few weeks , " schwab said in an impromptu statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab says the overhaul of the global financial system will take time " it has the support of almost every political leader who was here " at davos in the past five days , said schwab , naming specifically un secretary general ban ki-moon and chinese prime minister wen jiabao as backers .
he said the upcoming meeting in april of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- would not be enough to solve the global economic crisis .
" it wo n't address the totality of the issues , " schwab said , adding it could at best deal with " technical " matters .
he said there needed to be a systemic redesign of the global banking system , financial regulation and corporate governance .
" the key is global cooperation , " schwab stated later , " not only among government but among all the stakeholders of our society . "
what happened at davos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davos is the world 's foremost gathering of business and government leaders the world economic forum for 2009 ended with many asking what was really accomplished during the five days many of the world 's political and economic leaders gathered in the frigid swiss village of davos .
in his concluding remarks at the end of an engaging session on the future of the economy with key economic players , the journalist martin wolf summed up many people 's thought by saying that while no one knew exactly what needed to be done , something needed to be done and fast .
it was also apparent that things were - in the mantra of our times - about to change .
the financial and economic systems would look different , more regulated and controlled , and with better governance .
while people would still get rich , the scale of wealth would diminish .
fitting for what britain 's gordon brown termed the first crisis of the global era , the importance of international institutions and global cooperation were emphasized as key components to getting the world out of the economic downturn .
blaming the bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalists see davos as part of the problem there was anger at the bankers and the inventors of the complex derivatives that helped lead the world into the crisis and upset that the governments were being reactive and moving too slowly .
but some felt there was a unique chance for change and build a better system of economics , in part based on the concept of a " green economy , " just in time for the international meeting at the end of the year when countries will try to agree on an aggressive global environmental convention .
the world 's top brass gathered at davos to conclude they did n't know what to do exactly but , possibly using some idea floated at the forum , were determined , maybe optimistically , to get the economy back on track in 2010 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab says the overhaul of the global financial system will take time " it has the support of almost every political leader who was here " at davos in the past five days , said schwab , naming specifically un secretary general ban ki-moon and chinese prime minister wen jiabao as backers .
he said the upcoming meeting in april of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- would not be enough to solve the global economic crisis .
" it wo n't address the totality of the issues , " schwab said , adding it could at best deal with " technical " matters .
he said there needed to be a systemic redesign of the global banking system , financial regulation and corporate governance .
" the key is global cooperation , " schwab stated later , " not only among government but among all the stakeholders of our society . "
what happened at davos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davos is the world 's foremost gathering of business and government leaders the world economic forum for 2009 ended with many asking what was really accomplished during the five days many of the world 's political and economic leaders gathered in the frigid swiss village of davos .
in his concluding remarks at the end of an engaging session on the future of the economy with key economic players , the journalist martin wolf summed up many people 's thought by saying that while no one knew exactly what needed to be done , something needed to be done and fast .
it was also apparent that things were - in the mantra of our times - about to change .
the financial and economic systems would look different , more regulated and controlled , and with better governance .
while people would still get rich , the scale of wealth would diminish .
fitting for what britain 's gordon brown termed the first crisis of the global era , the importance of international institutions and global cooperation were emphasized as key components to getting the world out of the economic downturn .
blaming the bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalists see davos as part of the problem there was anger at the bankers and the inventors of the complex derivatives that helped lead the world into the crisis and upset that the governments were being reactive and moving too slowly .
but some felt there was a unique chance for change and build a better system of economics , in part based on the concept of a " green economy , " just in time for the international meeting at the end of the year when countries will try to agree on an aggressive global environmental convention .
the world 's top brass gathered at davos to conclude they did n't know what to do exactly but , possibly using some idea floated at the forum , were determined , maybe optimistically , to get the economy back on track in 2010 .

the meeting was , nonetheless , a success , says deutsche welle 's michael knigge . if you expected concrete measures for the solution of the global economic crisis and a schedule for their implementation , you will have to consider the world economic forum in davos a failure .
now that the summit is over , the way out of the economic crisis is still not any clearer than it was before the meeting in switzerland .

economists nouriel roubini and nassim taleb - famous for their pessimistic but accurate forecasts - demanded the full privatization of banks .
and british prime minister gordon brown spoke up , like several other participants , in favor of strengthening the world bank and the international monetary fund .
but the question of how these ideas should be practically implemented and how long this would take remained unanswered .
and that for a good reason : many propositions contradicted each other , either in parts or fully .
this made the most important element of any solution for the world economic crisis - a global consensus on the methods - impossible to reach .
one should , nevertheless , consider the world economic forum a success .
seeing managers and politicians discussing issues and fighting each other , witnessing business bosses and ministers trying to get a grip on the roots and development of the crisis , and sensing the uncertainty of the elites about the future , one could only conclude : the time for solutions was not yet ripe .
instead of adopting a master plan with concrete steps for the future , davos delegates had systematic analysis , collective wound-licking and mutual soul-massage as the order of the day .
for the first time since the beginning of the crisis , business and political leaders could thoroughly share and exchange opinions with one another in the midst of the swiss alps .
in a certain way , the world economic forum functioned as a global psycho-couch .
that may not be satisfactory from the point of few of the people all over the world who are suffering from the economic crisis .
but without accepting and coming to terms with a crisis - that 's what any wanna-be psychologist will tell you - no breakthrough will be possible .

in a public declaration , fuerst charged that benedict 's rehabilitation of williamson had led to " external and internal alienation from the church on the part of many believers , to a betrayal of trust especially among jewish sisters and brothers in their relationship to the church , and to a considerable disturbance in the christian-jewish dialogue . "
to end a schism with ultraconservatives , rome last week lifted its excommunication of four men who ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- outside the church for more than 20 years .
british-born williamson , who runs a seminary in argentina , was one of them .
in related developments on saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican and the pope named an ultraconservative austrian priest as bishop in linz .
williamson being shunned by colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson could face criminal charges in germany earlier this week , gerhard ludwig mueller , the catholic bishop of the german city of regensburg which is also the pope 's home city , declared williamson persona-non-grata in his district .
williamson has denied the holocaust in recent weeks in germany and sweden .
public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany .
bishop fuerst called the pardoning of williamson " a heavy burden for me as bishop and as spiritual pastor . "
fuerst charged that the rehabilitation of all four priests undermined the " precious " unity of the church , the upholding of which was among the " highest obligations of the pope and the bishops . "
the four priests have defied changes made in the church after the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- which , among other things , loosened strict adherence to latin as the language of worship and started the ecumenical outreach to other christian churches and other religions .
by denying the council and being rehabilitated , the priests were threatening church unity , fuerst said .
" the price of such denial is that many believers will internally or externally turn away , " fuerst said .
" without exception , the theology and pastorals of our diocese , for which i am responsible as bishop , are and remain the legacy of the second vatican council and its central directives , " fuerst said .
" the desire for real unity must come from cooperation .
whoever belongs to the church may not question the basic concepts of the council . "
israel threatens suspension of rleationship with vatican bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is said to be outraged by the pope 's decision earlier saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs , yitzhak cohen , threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican following the pope 's pardoning of williamson , german news magazine spiegel reported saturday .
cohen said he recommended " completely cutting off connections to a body in which holocaust deniers and anti-semites are members . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on january 27 .
academic renounces catholic membership in protest following on from bishop fuerst 's criticism , a philosophy and ethics professor at radboud university of nijmegen , until 2004 formally a catholic university , has formally renounced his membership of the catholic church to protest the rehabilitation of the sspx . in an interview for dutch catholic internet magazine katholiek nederland , belgian-born jean-pierre wils said he refuses to associate himself any further with the church 's " anti-modern , anti-pluralistic and totalitarian " attitude . wils said he made his decision after rome revoked on january 24 the 1988 excommunication of the four clerics , who led the breakaway , ultra-traditionalist catholic group which accents prayer in latin and opposition to jewish beliefs . in the interview , professor wils , who lives in germany but teaches at the university in the south-east netherlands , called the sspx an " extremely reactionary and deeply anti-semitic " group that " sympathizes with dictators and fundamentalist rightist extremists . " according to the scholar , the sspx bishops claim jews and freemasons manipulated the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- . one of the second vatican council 's most heavily debated documents was the nostra aetate , in which the church renounced its traditional approach that all jews , including contemporary jews , were responsible for the jesus ' death . the second vatican council also lifted the obligation for all catholics to actively convert jews .
austrian catholics criticize appointment meanwhile , catholic priests in austria on sunday criticized the vatican for naming an ultraconservative priest as auxiliary bishop in linz on saturday without having consulted the local church . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has made headlines in the past when he condemned jk rowling 's harry potter books for its " satanist " content . he also suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was god 's punishment , as it destroyed five abortion clinics as well as nightclubs in new orleans . " i am not very happy about this , since i get the general impression that there was no attempt to communicate with the diocese , " hans padinger , spokesman of the priests in linz , told austrian broadcaster orf . the town of linz is the seat of one of austria 's seven dioceses , or territorial units of the catholic church . franz wild was one priest who voiced even sharper criticism .
" i am shocked by this decision , " he told the regional paper oberoesterreichische rundschau . " i hope the church realizes that we live in the 21st century and that the church must live in that period , too , " he said . a significant portion of austrian catholics see themselves as more liberal than the vatican , opposing rome 's views on abortion , homosexuality or the ban on married priests . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fuerst charged that the rehabilitation of all four priests undermined the " precious " unity of the church , the upholding of which was among the " highest obligations of the pope and the bishops . "
the four priests have defied changes made in the church after the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- which , among other things , loosened strict adherence to latin as the language of worship and started the ecumenical outreach to other christian churches and other religions .
by denying the council and being rehabilitated , the priests were threatening church unity , fuerst said .
" the price of such denial is that many believers will internally or externally turn away , " fuerst said .
" without exception , the theology and pastorals of our diocese , for which i am responsible as bishop , are and remain the legacy of the second vatican council and its central directives , " fuerst said .
" the desire for real unity must come from cooperation .
whoever belongs to the church may not question the basic concepts of the council . "

but there were few signs that a sideline meeting saturday of trade ministers from about 20 countries had managed to push ahead the long-stalled doha round of trade talks , meant to create freer markets .
" throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not right , " said world trade organization director general pascal lamy .
" trade is not the cause of crisis . "
the concerns over protectionism - measures such as tariffs which would place restrains on trade - were sparked by the harsh reminders that isolationist policies in response to the market crash of 1929 wreaked havoc and in part created the harshness of the great depression .
nations could take steps to protect their industries , but protectionism distorts markets , said lamy , adding that he would monitor legislation in various countries which might violate wto rules .
he urged the us senate to be careful when it voted on a stimulus bill , already passed in the house of representatives , which did contain some " buy american " elements .
with the international monetary fund predicting the weakest year of growth since the second world war , there was real concern over measures which might impede commerce needed to get the world economy out of the downturn .
warning of social unrest france 's finance minister christine lagarde said the two greatest concerns were social unrest and protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .
several politicians openly stated they were under pressure from businesses at home to take big steps towards protecting local enterprises .
at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .
many hopes were pinned on the upcoming meeting of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- in april in london , with expectations that the major emerging economies will have to be part of a solution in such a global crisis .
there were repeated calls , from indian to british officials , to take steps to boost the imf and other international institutions .
japan said it was ready to give 1 $ 00 billion to the fund , which itself has asked for $ 250 billion .
however , it was clear most leaders did not feel there was a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the problems and each state would have to take right steps for its economy .
an era of humility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton said making less money could be a good thing no one was willing to predict when the crisis would end , or even bottom out .
the optimists would only say that eventually things would work out , though changes would be made .
" people will still make money but not like in past decade , and that 's a good thing , " said former us president bill clinton .
regulation would likely get tougher both on existing banks and all financial institutions .
" if it walks as a bank and quacks like a bank it needs to be regulated like a bank , " said peter sands of britain 's standard chartered bank .
several business leaders said they were simply waiting for the proverbial other shoe to fall , such as when it became clear how badly hedge funds were affected .
the financial world was entering , in the words of a private investor , " a new era of humility . "
but for the already humbled , the world 's poorest or " bottom billion " people , times might get tougher as they will lack both the capital and the credit to stimulate their economies , while the industries they depend on are likely to be hard hit .
a vulnerability fund world bank president robert zoellick suggested that the industrialized world should put aside 0.7 per cent of their stimulus packages for a " vulnerability fund " for developing countries suffering in the global downturn .
he urged against leaving the weakest " out in the cold . "

like others , he also said an eye should be kept on the ball in regards to climate change , particularly with countries set to gather at the end of the year in an attempt to pass an aggressive environmental accord .

but there were few signs that a sideline meeting saturday of trade ministers from about 20 countries had managed to push ahead the long-stalled doha round of trade talks , meant to create freer markets .
" throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not right , " said world trade organization director general pascal lamy .
" trade is not the cause of crisis . "
the concerns over protectionism - measures such as tariffs which would place restrains on trade - were sparked by the harsh reminders that isolationist policies in response to the market crash of 1929 wreaked havoc and in part created the harshness of the great depression .
nations could take steps to protect their industries , but protectionism distorts markets , said lamy , adding that he would monitor legislation in various countries which might violate wto rules .
he urged the us senate to be careful when it voted on a stimulus bill , already passed in the house of representatives , which did contain some " buy american " elements .
with the international monetary fund predicting the weakest year of growth since the second world war , there was real concern over measures which might impede commerce needed to get the world economy out of the downturn .
warning of social unrest france 's finance minister christine lagarde said the two greatest concerns were social unrest and protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .
several politicians openly stated they were under pressure from businesses at home to take big steps towards protecting local enterprises .
at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .
many hopes were pinned on the upcoming meeting of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- in april in london , with expectations that the major emerging economies will have to be part of a solution in such a global crisis .
there were repeated calls , from indian to british officials , to take steps to boost the imf and other international institutions .
japan said it was ready to give 1 $ 00 billion to the fund , which itself has asked for $ 250 billion .
however , it was clear most leaders did not feel there was a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the problems and each state would have to take right steps for its economy .
an era of humility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton said making less money could be a good thing no one was willing to predict when the crisis would end , or even bottom out .
the optimists would only say that eventually things would work out , though changes would be made .
" people will still make money but not like in past decade , and that 's a good thing , " said former us president bill clinton .
regulation would likely get tougher both on existing banks and all financial institutions .
" if it walks as a bank and quacks like a bank it needs to be regulated like a bank , " said peter sands of britain 's standard chartered bank .

now , they 've concluded that he died shortly after being shot with a flint-tipped arrow . " he only lived for a short time after the arrow impact , " said andreas nerlich , who headed a joint study by the ludwig maximilians university of munich and experts from bolzano , italy . shortly before he was shot in the back , the iceman suffered a non-lethal blow with a blunt object , possibly a stone from a slingshot , nerlich 's team said in a letter to the online journal intensive care medicine . explaining the death 5,000 years ago of the hunter has challenged some of the world 's best scientists . precise timeline established the team around nerlich studied chemical changes in living tissue to establish how long each of oetzi 's injuries happened before his death in the snow of the oetztal glacier in italy 's south tyrol region . they said their findings , using new immunohistochemical techniques , of a fatal shot in the back supported the hypothesis that oetzi was being chased at the time he was killed .
the lesion from the blow was just below the arrow strike . " we 're now able to provide information about the age and sequence of wounds , " said nerlich in munich . a deep cut in the iceman 's hand , which has already been studied in the past , happened several days earlier , possibly in an accident with his flint knife .

but there were few signs that a sideline meeting saturday of trade ministers from about 20 countries had managed to push ahead the long-stalled doha round of trade talks , meant to create freer markets .
" throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not right , " said world trade organization director general pascal lamy .
" trade is not the cause of crisis . "
the concerns over protectionism - measures such as tariffs which would place restrains on trade - were sparked by the harsh reminders that isolationist policies in response to the market crash of 1929 wreaked havoc and in part created the harshness of the great depression .
nations could take steps to protect their industries , but protectionism distorts markets , said lamy , adding that he would monitor legislation in various countries which might violate wto rules .
he urged the us senate to be careful when it voted on a stimulus bill , already passed in the house of representatives , which did contain some " buy american " elements .
with the international monetary fund predicting the weakest year of growth since the second world war , there was real concern over measures which might impede commerce needed to get the world economy out of the downturn .
warning of social unrest france 's finance minister christine lagarde said the two greatest concerns were social unrest and protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .
several politicians openly stated they were under pressure from businesses at home to take big steps towards protecting local enterprises .
at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .
many hopes were pinned on the upcoming meeting of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- in april in london , with expectations that the major emerging economies will have to be part of a solution in such a global crisis .
there were repeated calls , from indian to british officials , to take steps to boost the imf and other international institutions .
japan said it was ready to give 1 $ 00 billion to the fund , which itself has asked for $ 250 billion .
however , it was clear most leaders did not feel there was a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the problems and each state would have to take right steps for its economy .
an era of humility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton said making less money could be a good thing no one was willing to predict when the crisis would end , or even bottom out .
the optimists would only say that eventually things would work out , though changes would be made .
" people will still make money but not like in past decade , and that 's a good thing , " said former us president bill clinton .
regulation would likely get tougher both on existing banks and all financial institutions .

but there were few signs that a sideline meeting saturday of trade ministers from about 20 countries had managed to push ahead the long-stalled doha round of trade talks , meant to create freer markets .
" throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not right , " said world trade organization director general pascal lamy .
" trade is not the cause of crisis . "
the concerns over protectionism - measures such as tariffs which would place restrains on trade - were sparked by the harsh reminders that isolationist policies in response to the market crash of 1929 wreaked havoc and in part created the harshness of the great depression .
nations could take steps to protect their industries , but protectionism distorts markets , said lamy , adding that he would monitor legislation in various countries which might violate wto rules .
he urged the us senate to be careful when it voted on a stimulus bill , already passed in the house of representatives , which did contain some " buy american " elements .
with the international monetary fund predicting the weakest year of growth since the second world war , there was real concern over measures which might impede commerce needed to get the world economy out of the downturn .
warning of social unrest france 's finance minister christine lagarde said the two greatest concerns were social unrest and protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .
several politicians openly stated they were under pressure from businesses at home to take big steps towards protecting local enterprises .
at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .
many hopes were pinned on the upcoming meeting of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- in april in london , with expectations that the major emerging economies will have to be part of a solution in such a global crisis .
there were repeated calls , from indian to british officials , to take steps to boost the imf and other international institutions .
japan said it was ready to give 1 $ 00 billion to the fund , which itself has asked for $ 250 billion .
however , it was clear most leaders did not feel there was a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the problems and each state would have to take right steps for its economy .

in a public declaration , fuerst charged that benedict 's rehabilitation of williamson had led to " external and internal alienation from the church on the part of many believers , to a betrayal of trust especially among jewish sisters and brothers in their relationship to the church , and to a considerable disturbance in the christian-jewish dialogue . "
to end a schism with ultraconservatives , rome last week lifted its excommunication of four men who ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- outside the church for more than 20 years .
british-born williamson , who runs a seminary in argentina , was one of them .
in related developments on saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican and the pope named an ultraconservative austrian priest as bishop in linz .
williamson being shunned by colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson could face criminal charges in germany earlier this week , gerhard ludwig mueller , the catholic bishop of the german city of regensburg which is also the pope 's home city , declared williamson persona-non-grata in his district .
williamson has denied the holocaust in recent weeks in germany and sweden .
public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany .
bishop fuerst called the pardoning of williamson " a heavy burden for me as bishop and as spiritual pastor . "
fuerst charged that the rehabilitation of all four priests undermined the " precious " unity of the church , the upholding of which was among the " highest obligations of the pope and the bishops . "
the four priests have defied changes made in the church after the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- which , among other things , loosened strict adherence to latin as the language of worship and started the ecumenical outreach to other christian churches and other religions .
by denying the council and being rehabilitated , the priests were threatening church unity , fuerst said .
" the price of such denial is that many believers will internally or externally turn away , " fuerst said .
" without exception , the theology and pastorals of our diocese , for which i am responsible as bishop , are and remain the legacy of the second vatican council and its central directives , " fuerst said .
" the desire for real unity must come from cooperation .
whoever belongs to the church may not question the basic concepts of the council . "
israel threatens suspension of rleationship with vatican bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is said to be outraged by the pope 's decision earlier saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs , yitzhak cohen , threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican following the pope 's pardoning of williamson , german news magazine spiegel reported saturday .
cohen said he recommended " completely cutting off connections to a body in which holocaust deniers and anti-semites are members . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on january 27 .
academic renounces catholic membership in protest following on from bishop fuerst 's criticism , a philosophy and ethics professor at radboud university of nijmegen , until 2004 formally a catholic university , has formally renounced his membership of the catholic church to protest the rehabilitation of the sspx . in an interview for dutch catholic internet magazine katholiek nederland , belgian-born jean-pierre wils said he refuses to associate himself any further with the church 's " anti-modern , anti-pluralistic and totalitarian " attitude . wils said he made his decision after rome revoked on january 24 the 1988 excommunication of the four clerics , who led the breakaway , ultra-traditionalist catholic group which accents prayer in latin and opposition to jewish beliefs . in the interview , professor wils , who lives in germany but teaches at the university in the south-east netherlands , called the sspx an " extremely reactionary and deeply anti-semitic " group that " sympathizes with dictators and fundamentalist rightist extremists . " according to the scholar , the sspx bishops claim jews and freemasons manipulated the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- . one of the second vatican council 's most heavily debated documents was the nostra aetate , in which the church renounced its traditional approach that all jews , including contemporary jews , were responsible for the jesus ' death . the second vatican council also lifted the obligation for all catholics to actively convert jews .
austrian catholics criticize appointment meanwhile , catholic priests in austria on sunday criticized the vatican for naming an ultraconservative priest as auxiliary bishop in linz on saturday without having consulted the local church . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has made headlines in the past when he condemned jk rowling 's harry potter books for its " satanist " content . he also suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was god 's punishment , as it destroyed five abortion clinics as well as nightclubs in new orleans . " i am not very happy about this , since i get the general impression that there was no attempt to communicate with the diocese , " hans padinger , spokesman of the priests in linz , told austrian broadcaster orf . the town of linz is the seat of one of austria 's seven dioceses , or territorial units of the catholic church . franz wild was one priest who voiced even sharper criticism .
" i am shocked by this decision , " he told the regional paper oberoesterreichische rundschau . " i hope the church realizes that we live in the 21st century and that the church must live in that period , too , " he said . a significant portion of austrian catholics see themselves as more liberal than the vatican , opposing rome 's views on abortion , homosexuality or the ban on married priests . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in related developments on saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican and the pope named an ultraconservative austrian priest as bishop in linz .
williamson being shunned by colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson could face criminal charges in germany earlier this week , gerhard ludwig mueller , the catholic bishop of the german city of regensburg which is also the pope 's home city , declared williamson persona-non-grata in his district .
williamson has denied the holocaust in recent weeks in germany and sweden .
public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany .
bishop fuerst called the pardoning of williamson " a heavy burden for me as bishop and as spiritual pastor . "
fuerst charged that the rehabilitation of all four priests undermined the " precious " unity of the church , the upholding of which was among the " highest obligations of the pope and the bishops . "
the four priests have defied changes made in the church after the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- which , among other things , loosened strict adherence to latin as the language of worship and started the ecumenical outreach to other christian churches and other religions .
by denying the council and being rehabilitated , the priests were threatening church unity , fuerst said .
" the price of such denial is that many believers will internally or externally turn away , " fuerst said .
" without exception , the theology and pastorals of our diocese , for which i am responsible as bishop , are and remain the legacy of the second vatican council and its central directives , " fuerst said .
" the desire for real unity must come from cooperation .
whoever belongs to the church may not question the basic concepts of the council . "
israel threatens suspension of rleationship with vatican bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is said to be outraged by the pope 's decision earlier saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs , yitzhak cohen , threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican following the pope 's pardoning of williamson , german news magazine spiegel reported saturday .
cohen said he recommended " completely cutting off connections to a body in which holocaust deniers and anti-semites are members . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on january 27 .
academic renounces catholic membership in protest following on from bishop fuerst 's criticism , a philosophy and ethics professor at radboud university of nijmegen , until 2004 formally a catholic university , has formally renounced his membership of the catholic church to protest the rehabilitation of the sspx . in an interview for dutch catholic internet magazine katholiek nederland , belgian-born jean-pierre wils said he refuses to associate himself any further with the church 's " anti-modern , anti-pluralistic and totalitarian " attitude . wils said he made his decision after rome revoked on january 24 the 1988 excommunication of the four clerics , who led the breakaway , ultra-traditionalist catholic group which accents prayer in latin and opposition to jewish beliefs . in the interview , professor wils , who lives in germany but teaches at the university in the south-east netherlands , called the sspx an " extremely reactionary and deeply anti-semitic " group that " sympathizes with dictators and fundamentalist rightist extremists . " according to the scholar , the sspx bishops claim jews and freemasons manipulated the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- . one of the second vatican council 's most heavily debated documents was the nostra aetate , in which the church renounced its traditional approach that all jews , including contemporary jews , were responsible for the jesus ' death . the second vatican council also lifted the obligation for all catholics to actively convert jews .
austrian catholics criticize appointment meanwhile , catholic priests in austria on sunday criticized the vatican for naming an ultraconservative priest as auxiliary bishop in linz on saturday without having consulted the local church . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has made headlines in the past when he condemned jk rowling 's harry potter books for its " satanist " content . he also suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was god 's punishment , as it destroyed five abortion clinics as well as nightclubs in new orleans . " i am not very happy about this , since i get the general impression that there was no attempt to communicate with the diocese , " hans padinger , spokesman of the priests in linz , told austrian broadcaster orf . the town of linz is the seat of one of austria 's seven dioceses , or territorial units of the catholic church . franz wild was one priest who voiced even sharper criticism .
" i am shocked by this decision , " he told the regional paper oberoesterreichische rundschau . " i hope the church realizes that we live in the 21st century and that the church must live in that period , too , " he said . a significant portion of austrian catholics see themselves as more liberal than the vatican , opposing rome 's views on abortion , homosexuality or the ban on married priests . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am shocked by this decision , " he told the regional paper oberoesterreichische rundschau . " i hope the church realizes that we live in the 21st century and that the church must live in that period , too , " he said . a significant portion of austrian catholics see themselves as more liberal than the vatican , opposing rome 's views on abortion , homosexuality or the ban on married priests . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a public declaration , fuerst charged that benedict 's rehabilitation of williamson had led to " external and internal alienation from the church on the part of many believers , to a betrayal of trust especially among jewish sisters and brothers in their relationship to the church , and to a considerable disturbance in the christian-jewish dialogue . "
to end a schism with ultraconservatives , rome last week lifted its excommunication of four men who ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- outside the church for more than 20 years .
british-born williamson , who runs a seminary in argentina , was one of them .
in related developments on saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican and the pope named an ultraconservative austrian priest as bishop in linz .
williamson being shunned by colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson could face criminal charges in germany earlier this week , gerhard ludwig mueller , the catholic bishop of the german city of regensburg which is also the pope 's home city , declared williamson persona-non-grata in his district .
williamson has denied the holocaust in recent weeks in germany and sweden .
public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany .
bishop fuerst called the pardoning of williamson " a heavy burden for me as bishop and as spiritual pastor . "
fuerst charged that the rehabilitation of all four priests undermined the " precious " unity of the church , the upholding of which was among the " highest obligations of the pope and the bishops . "
the four priests have defied changes made in the church after the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- which , among other things , loosened strict adherence to latin as the language of worship and started the ecumenical outreach to other christian churches and other religions .
by denying the council and being rehabilitated , the priests were threatening church unity , fuerst said .
" the price of such denial is that many believers will internally or externally turn away , " fuerst said .
" without exception , the theology and pastorals of our diocese , for which i am responsible as bishop , are and remain the legacy of the second vatican council and its central directives , " fuerst said .
" the desire for real unity must come from cooperation .
whoever belongs to the church may not question the basic concepts of the council . "
israel threatens suspension of rleationship with vatican bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is said to be outraged by the pope 's decision earlier saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs , yitzhak cohen , threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican following the pope 's pardoning of williamson , german news magazine spiegel reported saturday .
cohen said he recommended " completely cutting off connections to a body in which holocaust deniers and anti-semites are members . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on january 27 .
academic renounces catholic membership in protest following on from bishop fuerst 's criticism , a philosophy and ethics professor at radboud university of nijmegen , until 2004 formally a catholic university , has formally renounced his membership of the catholic church to protest the rehabilitation of the sspx . in an interview for dutch catholic internet magazine katholiek nederland , belgian-born jean-pierre wils said he refuses to associate himself any further with the church 's " anti-modern , anti-pluralistic and totalitarian " attitude . wils said he made his decision after rome revoked on january 24 the 1988 excommunication of the four clerics , who led the breakaway , ultra-traditionalist catholic group which accents prayer in latin and opposition to jewish beliefs . in the interview , professor wils , who lives in germany but teaches at the university in the south-east netherlands , called the sspx an " extremely reactionary and deeply anti-semitic " group that " sympathizes with dictators and fundamentalist rightist extremists . " according to the scholar , the sspx bishops claim jews and freemasons manipulated the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- . one of the second vatican council 's most heavily debated documents was the nostra aetate , in which the church renounced its traditional approach that all jews , including contemporary jews , were responsible for the jesus ' death . the second vatican council also lifted the obligation for all catholics to actively convert jews .

the meeting was , nonetheless , a success , says deutsche welle 's michael knigge . if you expected concrete measures for the solution of the global economic crisis and a schedule for their implementation , you will have to consider the world economic forum in davos a failure .
now that the summit is over , the way out of the economic crisis is still not any clearer than it was before the meeting in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge certainly , there were enough suggestions : german chancellor angela merkel advocated the creation of an international economic council as the new controlling body , which - just like the security council - would be residing at the united nations .
economists nouriel roubini and nassim taleb - famous for their pessimistic but accurate forecasts - demanded the full privatization of banks .
and british prime minister gordon brown spoke up , like several other participants , in favor of strengthening the world bank and the international monetary fund .
but the question of how these ideas should be practically implemented and how long this would take remained unanswered .
and that for a good reason : many propositions contradicted each other , either in parts or fully .
this made the most important element of any solution for the world economic crisis - a global consensus on the methods - impossible to reach .
one should , nevertheless , consider the world economic forum a success .
seeing managers and politicians discussing issues and fighting each other , witnessing business bosses and ministers trying to get a grip on the roots and development of the crisis , and sensing the uncertainty of the elites about the future , one could only conclude : the time for solutions was not yet ripe .
instead of adopting a master plan with concrete steps for the future , davos delegates had systematic analysis , collective wound-licking and mutual soul-massage as the order of the day .
for the first time since the beginning of the crisis , business and political leaders could thoroughly share and exchange opinions with one another in the midst of the swiss alps .
in a certain way , the world economic forum functioned as a global psycho-couch .
that may not be satisfactory from the point of few of the people all over the world who are suffering from the economic crisis .
but without accepting and coming to terms with a crisis - that 's what any wanna-be psychologist will tell you - no breakthrough will be possible .
if an important part of getting to understand and evaluate the crisis took part in davos , then the world economic forum was a success .
a breakthrough would have to happen at the latest at the london g-20 summit in april .

in a certain way , the world economic forum functioned as a global psycho-couch .
that may not be satisfactory from the point of few of the people all over the world who are suffering from the economic crisis .
but without accepting and coming to terms with a crisis - that 's what any wanna-be psychologist will tell you - no breakthrough will be possible .

the meeting was , nonetheless , a success , says deutsche welle 's michael knigge . if you expected concrete measures for the solution of the global economic crisis and a schedule for their implementation , you will have to consider the world economic forum in davos a failure .
now that the summit is over , the way out of the economic crisis is still not any clearer than it was before the meeting in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge certainly , there were enough suggestions : german chancellor angela merkel advocated the creation of an international economic council as the new controlling body , which - just like the security council - would be residing at the united nations .
economists nouriel roubini and nassim taleb - famous for their pessimistic but accurate forecasts - demanded the full privatization of banks .
and british prime minister gordon brown spoke up , like several other participants , in favor of strengthening the world bank and the international monetary fund .
but the question of how these ideas should be practically implemented and how long this would take remained unanswered .
and that for a good reason : many propositions contradicted each other , either in parts or fully .
this made the most important element of any solution for the world economic crisis - a global consensus on the methods - impossible to reach .
one should , nevertheless , consider the world economic forum a success .
seeing managers and politicians discussing issues and fighting each other , witnessing business bosses and ministers trying to get a grip on the roots and development of the crisis , and sensing the uncertainty of the elites about the future , one could only conclude : the time for solutions was not yet ripe .
instead of adopting a master plan with concrete steps for the future , davos delegates had systematic analysis , collective wound-licking and mutual soul-massage as the order of the day .
for the first time since the beginning of the crisis , business and political leaders could thoroughly share and exchange opinions with one another in the midst of the swiss alps .
in a certain way , the world economic forum functioned as a global psycho-couch .
that may not be satisfactory from the point of few of the people all over the world who are suffering from the economic crisis .
but without accepting and coming to terms with a crisis - that 's what any wanna-be psychologist will tell you - no breakthrough will be possible .
if an important part of getting to understand and evaluate the crisis took part in davos , then the world economic forum was a success .
a breakthrough would have to happen at the latest at the london g-20 summit in april .

" we will start a global redesign initiative in next few weeks , " schwab said in an impromptu statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab says the overhaul of the global financial system will take time " it has the support of almost every political leader who was here " at davos in the past five days , said schwab , naming specifically un secretary general ban ki-moon and chinese prime minister wen jiabao as backers .
he said the upcoming meeting in april of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- would not be enough to solve the global economic crisis .
" it wo n't address the totality of the issues , " schwab said , adding it could at best deal with " technical " matters .
he said there needed to be a systemic redesign of the global banking system , financial regulation and corporate governance .
" the key is global cooperation , " schwab stated later , " not only among government but among all the stakeholders of our society . "
what happened at davos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davos is the world 's foremost gathering of business and government leaders the world economic forum for 2009 ended with many asking what was really accomplished during the five days many of the world 's political and economic leaders gathered in the frigid swiss village of davos .
in his concluding remarks at the end of an engaging session on the future of the economy with key economic players , the journalist martin wolf summed up many people 's thought by saying that while no one knew exactly what needed to be done , something needed to be done and fast .
it was also apparent that things were - in the mantra of our times - about to change .
the financial and economic systems would look different , more regulated and controlled , and with better governance .
while people would still get rich , the scale of wealth would diminish .
fitting for what britain 's gordon brown termed the first crisis of the global era , the importance of international institutions and global cooperation were emphasized as key components to getting the world out of the economic downturn .
blaming the bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalists see davos as part of the problem there was anger at the bankers and the inventors of the complex derivatives that helped lead the world into the crisis and upset that the governments were being reactive and moving too slowly .
but some felt there was a unique chance for change and build a better system of economics , in part based on the concept of a " green economy , " just in time for the international meeting at the end of the year when countries will try to agree on an aggressive global environmental convention .
the world 's top brass gathered at davos to conclude they did n't know what to do exactly but , possibly using some idea floated at the forum , were determined , maybe optimistically , to get the economy back on track in 2010 .

" we will start a global redesign initiative in next few weeks , " schwab said in an impromptu statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab says the overhaul of the global financial system will take time " it has the support of almost every political leader who was here " at davos in the past five days , said schwab , naming specifically un secretary general ban ki-moon and chinese prime minister wen jiabao as backers .
he said the upcoming meeting in april of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- would not be enough to solve the global economic crisis .
" it wo n't address the totality of the issues , " schwab said , adding it could at best deal with " technical " matters .
he said there needed to be a systemic redesign of the global banking system , financial regulation and corporate governance .
" the key is global cooperation , " schwab stated later , " not only among government but among all the stakeholders of our society . "
what happened at davos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davos is the world 's foremost gathering of business and government leaders the world economic forum for 2009 ended with many asking what was really accomplished during the five days many of the world 's political and economic leaders gathered in the frigid swiss village of davos .
in his concluding remarks at the end of an engaging session on the future of the economy with key economic players , the journalist martin wolf summed up many people 's thought by saying that while no one knew exactly what needed to be done , something needed to be done and fast .
it was also apparent that things were - in the mantra of our times - about to change .
the financial and economic systems would look different , more regulated and controlled , and with better governance .
while people would still get rich , the scale of wealth would diminish .
fitting for what britain 's gordon brown termed the first crisis of the global era , the importance of international institutions and global cooperation were emphasized as key components to getting the world out of the economic downturn .
blaming the bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalists see davos as part of the problem there was anger at the bankers and the inventors of the complex derivatives that helped lead the world into the crisis and upset that the governments were being reactive and moving too slowly .
but some felt there was a unique chance for change and build a better system of economics , in part based on the concept of a " green economy , " just in time for the international meeting at the end of the year when countries will try to agree on an aggressive global environmental convention .
the world 's top brass gathered at davos to conclude they did n't know what to do exactly but , possibly using some idea floated at the forum , were determined , maybe optimistically , to get the economy back on track in 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 01.02.2009 german government fails to agree on proposed environmental law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-activists fear the consequences of the failed law a law aimed at streamlining germany 's environmental legislation - one of the coalition government 's core projects - will not be adopted in the current legislative period , said the german environment minister . " germany will still have no straightforward , transparent and unbureaucratic environmental law in one piece , " environment minister sigmar gabriel said in a statement on sunday .
" the existing fragmentation will remain in place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister gabriel has blamed his coalition partners each of germany 's 16 states has its own set of regulations on issues such as pollution , which makes the approval process for firms planning new projects like roads or factories highly bureaucratic and complex .
the environment minister , of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , was critical of the internal political wranglings inherent to the process by which individual state approval is sought for proposals to pass .
bavaria , led by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- sister party of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ultimately did n't approve the draft law , criticizing it for adding another layer of bureaucracy for companies seeking environmental certification .
the project failed " due to a hollow lack of reform and blind blocking policies of the union , " gabriel said .
states are in charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel proposed a new set of regulations two decades ago in the 1980s , a decision was made to try and simplify the country 's environmental regulations .
in 1997 , then environment minister angela merkel - now chancellor - proposed a new , one-size-fits-all set of regulations to speed things up .

the environment minister , of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , was critical of the internal political wranglings inherent to the process by which individual state approval is sought for proposals to pass .

but there were few signs that a sideline meeting saturday of trade ministers from about 20 countries had managed to push ahead the long-stalled doha round of trade talks , meant to create freer markets .
" throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not right , " said world trade organization director general pascal lamy .
" trade is not the cause of crisis . "
the concerns over protectionism - measures such as tariffs which would place restrains on trade - were sparked by the harsh reminders that isolationist policies in response to the market crash of 1929 wreaked havoc and in part created the harshness of the great depression .
nations could take steps to protect their industries , but protectionism distorts markets , said lamy , adding that he would monitor legislation in various countries which might violate wto rules .
he urged the us senate to be careful when it voted on a stimulus bill , already passed in the house of representatives , which did contain some " buy american " elements .
with the international monetary fund predicting the weakest year of growth since the second world war , there was real concern over measures which might impede commerce needed to get the world economy out of the downturn .
warning of social unrest france 's finance minister christine lagarde said the two greatest concerns were social unrest and protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .
several politicians openly stated they were under pressure from businesses at home to take big steps towards protecting local enterprises .
at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .
many hopes were pinned on the upcoming meeting of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- in april in london , with expectations that the major emerging economies will have to be part of a solution in such a global crisis .
there were repeated calls , from indian to british officials , to take steps to boost the imf and other international institutions .
japan said it was ready to give 1 $ 00 billion to the fund , which itself has asked for $ 250 billion .
however , it was clear most leaders did not feel there was a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the problems and each state would have to take right steps for its economy .
an era of humility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton said making less money could be a good thing no one was willing to predict when the crisis would end , or even bottom out .
the optimists would only say that eventually things would work out , though changes would be made .
" people will still make money but not like in past decade , and that 's a good thing , " said former us president bill clinton .
regulation would likely get tougher both on existing banks and all financial institutions .
" if it walks as a bank and quacks like a bank it needs to be regulated like a bank , " said peter sands of britain 's standard chartered bank .
several business leaders said they were simply waiting for the proverbial other shoe to fall , such as when it became clear how badly hedge funds were affected .
the financial world was entering , in the words of a private investor , " a new era of humility . "
but for the already humbled , the world 's poorest or " bottom billion " people , times might get tougher as they will lack both the capital and the credit to stimulate their economies , while the industries they depend on are likely to be hard hit .
a vulnerability fund world bank president robert zoellick suggested that the industrialized world should put aside 0.7 per cent of their stimulus packages for a " vulnerability fund " for developing countries suffering in the global downturn .
he urged against leaving the weakest " out in the cold . "

like others , he also said an eye should be kept on the ball in regards to climate change , particularly with countries set to gather at the end of the year in an attempt to pass an aggressive environmental accord .

but there were few signs that a sideline meeting saturday of trade ministers from about 20 countries had managed to push ahead the long-stalled doha round of trade talks , meant to create freer markets .
" throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not right , " said world trade organization director general pascal lamy .
" trade is not the cause of crisis . "
the concerns over protectionism - measures such as tariffs which would place restrains on trade - were sparked by the harsh reminders that isolationist policies in response to the market crash of 1929 wreaked havoc and in part created the harshness of the great depression .
nations could take steps to protect their industries , but protectionism distorts markets , said lamy , adding that he would monitor legislation in various countries which might violate wto rules .
he urged the us senate to be careful when it voted on a stimulus bill , already passed in the house of representatives , which did contain some " buy american " elements .
with the international monetary fund predicting the weakest year of growth since the second world war , there was real concern over measures which might impede commerce needed to get the world economy out of the downturn .
warning of social unrest france 's finance minister christine lagarde said the two greatest concerns were social unrest and protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .
several politicians openly stated they were under pressure from businesses at home to take big steps towards protecting local enterprises .
at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .
many hopes were pinned on the upcoming meeting of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- in april in london , with expectations that the major emerging economies will have to be part of a solution in such a global crisis .
there were repeated calls , from indian to british officials , to take steps to boost the imf and other international institutions .
japan said it was ready to give 1 $ 00 billion to the fund , which itself has asked for $ 250 billion .
however , it was clear most leaders did not feel there was a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the problems and each state would have to take right steps for its economy .

that 's illegal in germany , so last august they moved to a small town in the us state of tennessee . germany is one of the few countries in europe not to allow home education .
sometimes german authorities turn a blind eye toward parents who teach their children themselves , but the romeikes say they had no choice but to move abroad after authorities came to their home to enforce the law . " the police were knocking at the door , and one day they took the children to school , and the children were crying because the policemen took the schoolbags by force , " uwe romeike told dw-radio .
" they were really rude - especially to my wife .

now , they 've concluded that he died shortly after being shot with a flint-tipped arrow . " he only lived for a short time after the arrow impact , " said andreas nerlich , who headed a joint study by the ludwig maximilians university of munich and experts from bolzano , italy . shortly before he was shot in the back , the iceman suffered a non-lethal blow with a blunt object , possibly a stone from a slingshot , nerlich 's team said in a letter to the online journal intensive care medicine . explaining the death 5,000 years ago of the hunter has challenged some of the world 's best scientists . precise timeline established the team around nerlich studied chemical changes in living tissue to establish how long each of oetzi 's injuries happened before his death in the snow of the oetztal glacier in italy 's south tyrol region . they said their findings , using new immunohistochemical techniques , of a fatal shot in the back supported the hypothesis that oetzi was being chased at the time he was killed .
the lesion from the blow was just below the arrow strike . " we 're now able to provide information about the age and sequence of wounds , " said nerlich in munich . a deep cut in the iceman 's hand , which has already been studied in the past , happened several days earlier , possibly in an accident with his flint knife .

now , they 've concluded that he died shortly after being shot with a flint-tipped arrow . " he only lived for a short time after the arrow impact , " said andreas nerlich , who headed a joint study by the ludwig maximilians university of munich and experts from bolzano , italy . shortly before he was shot in the back , the iceman suffered a non-lethal blow with a blunt object , possibly a stone from a slingshot , nerlich 's team said in a letter to the online journal intensive care medicine . explaining the death 5,000 years ago of the hunter has challenged some of the world 's best scientists . precise timeline established the team around nerlich studied chemical changes in living tissue to establish how long each of oetzi 's injuries happened before his death in the snow of the oetztal glacier in italy 's south tyrol region . they said their findings , using new immunohistochemical techniques , of a fatal shot in the back supported the hypothesis that oetzi was being chased at the time he was killed .
the lesion from the blow was just below the arrow strike . " we 're now able to provide information about the age and sequence of wounds , " said nerlich in munich . a deep cut in the iceman 's hand , which has already been studied in the past , happened several days earlier , possibly in an accident with his flint knife .

but one young , religious german family has left their homeland for the united states so that they could teach their children as they see fit . for damaris , christian , josua , lydia and daniel romeike , a school day starts at the table with their father reading the bible to them - in english then explaining the words and expressions in german . uwe and hannelore romeike are educating their children , aged 3 to 11 , at home .
that 's illegal in germany , so last august they moved to a small town in the us state of tennessee . germany is one of the few countries in europe not to allow home education .
sometimes german authorities turn a blind eye toward parents who teach their children themselves , but the romeikes say they had no choice but to move abroad after authorities came to their home to enforce the law . " the police were knocking at the door , and one day they took the children to school , and the children were crying because the policemen took the schoolbags by force , " uwe romeike told dw-radio .
" they were really rude - especially to my wife . " in addition to noticing daniel and lydia become quiet and more prone to crying for the few years they attended a german school , the deeply religious romeikes say they objected to the content of the instruction their children received . " we noticed that the school books always reflect certain values , that education can not be neutral , " hannelore romeike said .
" we communicate our values , the teachers communicate theirs , and if the kids are at school , we can not have an influence on what they learn . " at home , the romeikes decide which books the children read and which lessons they learn .
they do not let their children read harry potter novels , for instance , because they are about witchcraft and the occult . but parents who maintain an influence on what their children learn by ignoring german rules on mandatory school education can face hefty fines and even jail sentences .

" we believe that homeschoolers in germany represent a social group and so we think that they definitely have a fear of persecution because the fines -lsb- can be -rsb- anywhere from a 1,000 up to 50,000 euros , " donnelly said .
" they threaten parents with custody actions by getting the family court involved and they also threaten them with prison . " in 2007 , an estimated 1.5 million children in the us - equal to 2.9 percent of the school-age population - were educated at home , according to a december 2008 report from the us national center for education statistics .
the national home education research institute puts the number of home schooled pupils at over 2 million . providing religious or moral instruction was the most important reason why parents chose to home school their children with concerns about the school environment placing second , the nces report said . home schooling proponents point to studies showing home schooled students perform better on standardized tests and have high college attendance rates .

now , they 've concluded that he died shortly after being shot with a flint-tipped arrow . " he only lived for a short time after the arrow impact , " said andreas nerlich , who headed a joint study by the ludwig maximilians university of munich and experts from bolzano , italy . shortly before he was shot in the back , the iceman suffered a non-lethal blow with a blunt object , possibly a stone from a slingshot , nerlich 's team said in a letter to the online journal intensive care medicine . explaining the death 5,000 years ago of the hunter has challenged some of the world 's best scientists . precise timeline established the team around nerlich studied chemical changes in living tissue to establish how long each of oetzi 's injuries happened before his death in the snow of the oetztal glacier in italy 's south tyrol region . they said their findings , using new immunohistochemical techniques , of a fatal shot in the back supported the hypothesis that oetzi was being chased at the time he was killed .
the lesion from the blow was just below the arrow strike . " we 're now able to provide information about the age and sequence of wounds , " said nerlich in munich . a deep cut in the iceman 's hand , which has already been studied in the past , happened several days earlier , possibly in an accident with his flint knife . " in the space of a few days he had two injury sequences , which could possibly indicate two separate attacks on him , " nerlich said . other scientists estimate oetzi , who is now on display in the south tyrol archaeology museum in bolzano , died at age 46 .

" we will start a global redesign initiative in next few weeks , " schwab said in an impromptu statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab says the overhaul of the global financial system will take time " it has the support of almost every political leader who was here " at davos in the past five days , said schwab , naming specifically un secretary general ban ki-moon and chinese prime minister wen jiabao as backers .
he said the upcoming meeting in april of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- would not be enough to solve the global economic crisis .
" it wo n't address the totality of the issues , " schwab said , adding it could at best deal with " technical " matters .
he said there needed to be a systemic redesign of the global banking system , financial regulation and corporate governance .
" the key is global cooperation , " schwab stated later , " not only among government but among all the stakeholders of our society . "
what happened at davos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davos is the world 's foremost gathering of business and government leaders the world economic forum for 2009 ended with many asking what was really accomplished during the five days many of the world 's political and economic leaders gathered in the frigid swiss village of davos .
in his concluding remarks at the end of an engaging session on the future of the economy with key economic players , the journalist martin wolf summed up many people 's thought by saying that while no one knew exactly what needed to be done , something needed to be done and fast .
it was also apparent that things were - in the mantra of our times - about to change .
the financial and economic systems would look different , more regulated and controlled , and with better governance .
while people would still get rich , the scale of wealth would diminish .
fitting for what britain 's gordon brown termed the first crisis of the global era , the importance of international institutions and global cooperation were emphasized as key components to getting the world out of the economic downturn .
blaming the bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalists see davos as part of the problem there was anger at the bankers and the inventors of the complex derivatives that helped lead the world into the crisis and upset that the governments were being reactive and moving too slowly .
but some felt there was a unique chance for change and build a better system of economics , in part based on the concept of a " green economy , " just in time for the international meeting at the end of the year when countries will try to agree on an aggressive global environmental convention .
the world 's top brass gathered at davos to conclude they did n't know what to do exactly but , possibly using some idea floated at the forum , were determined , maybe optimistically , to get the economy back on track in 2010 .
success , though , will depend on how well they perform in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the compromise calls for pay increases of 2.5 per cent as of sunday and a second increase of 2 per cent on january 1 , 2010 .
in addition , a one-time payment of 500 euros -lrb- $ 640 -rrb- in december was made as part of the 18-month contract .
panels on both the union side as well as german rail must approve the deal , but that was seen as a formality .
unions had been demanding 6.5 to 10 percent pay increases .
deutsche bahn had offered 1 percent .
german rail union transnet head alexander kirchner said the employer had made concessions , including better working conditions , and he called the agreement a good sign for the economy .

long-distance trains from the bavarian city of nuremberg to hamburg and karlsruhe had to be cancelled , but most services in the other 14 german states were operating normally . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a public declaration , fuerst charged that benedict 's rehabilitation of williamson had led to " external and internal alienation from the church on the part of many believers , to a betrayal of trust especially among jewish sisters and brothers in their relationship to the church , and to a considerable disturbance in the christian-jewish dialogue . "
to end a schism with ultraconservatives , rome last week lifted its excommunication of four men who ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- outside the church for more than 20 years .
british-born williamson , who runs a seminary in argentina , was one of them .
in related developments on saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican and the pope named an ultraconservative austrian priest as bishop in linz .
williamson being shunned by colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson could face criminal charges in germany earlier this week , gerhard ludwig mueller , the catholic bishop of the german city of regensburg which is also the pope 's home city , declared williamson persona-non-grata in his district .
williamson has denied the holocaust in recent weeks in germany and sweden .
public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany .
bishop fuerst called the pardoning of williamson " a heavy burden for me as bishop and as spiritual pastor . "
fuerst charged that the rehabilitation of all four priests undermined the " precious " unity of the church , the upholding of which was among the " highest obligations of the pope and the bishops . "
the four priests have defied changes made in the church after the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- which , among other things , loosened strict adherence to latin as the language of worship and started the ecumenical outreach to other christian churches and other religions .
by denying the council and being rehabilitated , the priests were threatening church unity , fuerst said .
" the price of such denial is that many believers will internally or externally turn away , " fuerst said .
" without exception , the theology and pastorals of our diocese , for which i am responsible as bishop , are and remain the legacy of the second vatican council and its central directives , " fuerst said .
" the desire for real unity must come from cooperation .
whoever belongs to the church may not question the basic concepts of the council . "
israel threatens suspension of rleationship with vatican bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is said to be outraged by the pope 's decision earlier saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs , yitzhak cohen , threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican following the pope 's pardoning of williamson , german news magazine spiegel reported saturday .
cohen said he recommended " completely cutting off connections to a body in which holocaust deniers and anti-semites are members . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on january 27 .
academic renounces catholic membership in protest following on from bishop fuerst 's criticism , a philosophy and ethics professor at radboud university of nijmegen , until 2004 formally a catholic university , has formally renounced his membership of the catholic church to protest the rehabilitation of the sspx . in an interview for dutch catholic internet magazine katholiek nederland , belgian-born jean-pierre wils said he refuses to associate himself any further with the church 's " anti-modern , anti-pluralistic and totalitarian " attitude . wils said he made his decision after rome revoked on january 24 the 1988 excommunication of the four clerics , who led the breakaway , ultra-traditionalist catholic group which accents prayer in latin and opposition to jewish beliefs . in the interview , professor wils , who lives in germany but teaches at the university in the south-east netherlands , called the sspx an " extremely reactionary and deeply anti-semitic " group that " sympathizes with dictators and fundamentalist rightist extremists . " according to the scholar , the sspx bishops claim jews and freemasons manipulated the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- . one of the second vatican council 's most heavily debated documents was the nostra aetate , in which the church renounced its traditional approach that all jews , including contemporary jews , were responsible for the jesus ' death . the second vatican council also lifted the obligation for all catholics to actively convert jews .
austrian catholics criticize appointment meanwhile , catholic priests in austria on sunday criticized the vatican for naming an ultraconservative priest as auxiliary bishop in linz on saturday without having consulted the local church . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has made headlines in the past when he condemned jk rowling 's harry potter books for its " satanist " content . he also suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was god 's punishment , as it destroyed five abortion clinics as well as nightclubs in new orleans . " i am not very happy about this , since i get the general impression that there was no attempt to communicate with the diocese , " hans padinger , spokesman of the priests in linz , told austrian broadcaster orf . the town of linz is the seat of one of austria 's seven dioceses , or territorial units of the catholic church . franz wild was one priest who voiced even sharper criticism .
" i am shocked by this decision , " he told the regional paper oberoesterreichische rundschau . " i hope the church realizes that we live in the 21st century and that the church must live in that period , too , " he said . a significant portion of austrian catholics see themselves as more liberal than the vatican , opposing rome 's views on abortion , homosexuality or the ban on married priests . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a public declaration , fuerst charged that benedict 's rehabilitation of williamson had led to " external and internal alienation from the church on the part of many believers , to a betrayal of trust especially among jewish sisters and brothers in their relationship to the church , and to a considerable disturbance in the christian-jewish dialogue . "
to end a schism with ultraconservatives , rome last week lifted its excommunication of four men who ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- outside the church for more than 20 years .
british-born williamson , who runs a seminary in argentina , was one of them .
in related developments on saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican and the pope named an ultraconservative austrian priest as bishop in linz .
williamson being shunned by colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop williamson could face criminal charges in germany earlier this week , gerhard ludwig mueller , the catholic bishop of the german city of regensburg which is also the pope 's home city , declared williamson persona-non-grata in his district .
williamson has denied the holocaust in recent weeks in germany and sweden .
public prosecutors have opened an inquiry against williamson over his remarks .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany .
bishop fuerst called the pardoning of williamson " a heavy burden for me as bishop and as spiritual pastor . "
fuerst charged that the rehabilitation of all four priests undermined the " precious " unity of the church , the upholding of which was among the " highest obligations of the pope and the bishops . "
the four priests have defied changes made in the church after the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- which , among other things , loosened strict adherence to latin as the language of worship and started the ecumenical outreach to other christian churches and other religions .
by denying the council and being rehabilitated , the priests were threatening church unity , fuerst said .
" the price of such denial is that many believers will internally or externally turn away , " fuerst said .
" without exception , the theology and pastorals of our diocese , for which i am responsible as bishop , are and remain the legacy of the second vatican council and its central directives , " fuerst said .
" the desire for real unity must come from cooperation .
whoever belongs to the church may not question the basic concepts of the council . "
israel threatens suspension of rleationship with vatican bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is said to be outraged by the pope 's decision earlier saturday , israel 's minister for religious affairs , yitzhak cohen , threatened to suspend relationships with the vatican following the pope 's pardoning of williamson , german news magazine spiegel reported saturday .
cohen said he recommended " completely cutting off connections to a body in which holocaust deniers and anti-semites are members . "
the timing of benedict 's pardon is considered particularly insensitive , as the announcement came just days before holocaust memorial day on january 27 .
academic renounces catholic membership in protest following on from bishop fuerst 's criticism , a philosophy and ethics professor at radboud university of nijmegen , until 2004 formally a catholic university , has formally renounced his membership of the catholic church to protest the rehabilitation of the sspx . in an interview for dutch catholic internet magazine katholiek nederland , belgian-born jean-pierre wils said he refuses to associate himself any further with the church 's " anti-modern , anti-pluralistic and totalitarian " attitude . wils said he made his decision after rome revoked on january 24 the 1988 excommunication of the four clerics , who led the breakaway , ultra-traditionalist catholic group which accents prayer in latin and opposition to jewish beliefs . in the interview , professor wils , who lives in germany but teaches at the university in the south-east netherlands , called the sspx an " extremely reactionary and deeply anti-semitic " group that " sympathizes with dictators and fundamentalist rightist extremists . " according to the scholar , the sspx bishops claim jews and freemasons manipulated the second vatican council -lrb- 1962-1965 -rrb- . one of the second vatican council 's most heavily debated documents was the nostra aetate , in which the church renounced its traditional approach that all jews , including contemporary jews , were responsible for the jesus ' death . the second vatican council also lifted the obligation for all catholics to actively convert jews .
austrian catholics criticize appointment meanwhile , catholic priests in austria on sunday criticized the vatican for naming an ultraconservative priest as auxiliary bishop in linz on saturday without having consulted the local church . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has made headlines in the past when he condemned jk rowling 's harry potter books for its " satanist " content . he also suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was god 's punishment , as it destroyed five abortion clinics as well as nightclubs in new orleans . " i am not very happy about this , since i get the general impression that there was no attempt to communicate with the diocese , " hans padinger , spokesman of the priests in linz , told austrian broadcaster orf . the town of linz is the seat of one of austria 's seven dioceses , or territorial units of the catholic church . franz wild was one priest who voiced even sharper criticism .
" i am shocked by this decision , " he told the regional paper oberoesterreichische rundschau . " i hope the church realizes that we live in the 21st century and that the church must live in that period , too , " he said . a significant portion of austrian catholics see themselves as more liberal than the vatican , opposing rome 's views on abortion , homosexuality or the ban on married priests . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hoffenheim did not slip up in their new environment on a return to league action after the seven-week winter break despite having league top scorer vedad ibisevic out injured for the rest of the season , chinedu obasi also sidelined and carlos eduardo suspended .
" it was very important to win the first game in the new stadium and to have a successful start into the second half of the season , " said captain selim teber .

" germany will still have no straightforward , transparent and unbureaucratic environmental law in one piece , " environment minister sigmar gabriel said in a statement on sunday .
" the existing fragmentation will remain in place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister gabriel has blamed his coalition partners each of germany 's 16 states has its own set of regulations on issues such as pollution , which makes the approval process for firms planning new projects like roads or factories highly bureaucratic and complex .
the environment minister , of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , was critical of the internal political wranglings inherent to the process by which individual state approval is sought for proposals to pass .
bavaria , led by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- sister party of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ultimately did n't approve the draft law , criticizing it for adding another layer of bureaucracy for companies seeking environmental certification .
the project failed " due to a hollow lack of reform and blind blocking policies of the union , " gabriel said .
states are in charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel proposed a new set of regulations two decades ago in the 1980s , a decision was made to try and simplify the country 's environmental regulations .
in 1997 , then environment minister angela merkel - now chancellor - proposed a new , one-size-fits-all set of regulations to speed things up .
when merkel 's conservatives and the social democrats formed the ruling " grand coalition " in 2005 , it was something both parties promised they would make happen .
the government was also hoping that less red tape would help speed up the billions of euros worth of infrastructure projects with which berlin aims to pull europe 's biggest economy out of its worst post-war recession .
party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2009 parliamentary elections pose a major problem for the coalition government with seven months to go before general elections - when both parties aim to ditch the other and form a coalition with another party - gabriel said that the agreement was impossible in the current legislative period .
gabriel , who is from the spd , said that with a lack of readiness to compromise the cdu / csu - which in turn blamed gabriel - was " damaging the economy and the environment at the same time . "
the german branch of friends of the earth , bund , said there was now a danger of a " race to the bottom " among german states to relax environmental regulations in order to attract investment . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 01.02.2009 hoffenheim return to top as dark horses continue to surprise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream continues for hoffenheim who head back to the top of the league tsg hoffenheim showed no sign of stage fright in their new home as they returned to the top of the bundesliga thanks to a 2-0 victory over lowly energie cottbus on saturday . demba ba and loan hiring boubacar sanogo were on target in the rhein-necker stadium after hoffenheim played their home games in the first half of the season in nearby mannheim .
hoffenheim did not slip up in their new environment on a return to league action after the seven-week winter break despite having league top scorer vedad ibisevic out injured for the rest of the season , chinedu obasi also sidelined and carlos eduardo suspended .
" it was very important to win the first game in the new stadium and to have a successful start into the second half of the season , " said captain selim teber .
the win sees hoffenheim move two points clear of hertha berlin and sv hamburg , who 24 hours at the top as mladen petric 's header the previous night ensured a 1-0 win over champions bayern munich in the official league restart .
" maybe we thought after the good game -lrb- tuesday 's 5-1 cup triumph at vfb stuttgart -rrb- that we would only require a half-hearted effort .
but you ca n't afford that against any team , and definitely not against hamburg , " said munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
hoffenheim ahead by a nose hoffenheim top the table with 38 points , hertha berlin and hamburg have 36 each and munich are now fourth on 35 .
hertha defeated eintracht frankfurt 2-1 on saturday .
hoffenheim were in command against drop-zone club cottbus from the start and ba slotted home the 1-0 lead in the 28th as two defenders failed to clear his original header .
the werder bremen import sanogo wasted a first chance in the 36th but did better in the 63rd with a short-range volley for 2-0 as cottbus protested in vain that he had pushed a defender before scoring .
hoffenheim goalkeeper timo hildebrand , who returned to germany in the winter break after being released by valencia , suffered a thigh injury and had to be replaced by daniel haas during the second half .

but there were few signs that a sideline meeting saturday of trade ministers from about 20 countries had managed to push ahead the long-stalled doha round of trade talks , meant to create freer markets .
" throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not right , " said world trade organization director general pascal lamy .
" trade is not the cause of crisis . "
the concerns over protectionism - measures such as tariffs which would place restrains on trade - were sparked by the harsh reminders that isolationist policies in response to the market crash of 1929 wreaked havoc and in part created the harshness of the great depression .
nations could take steps to protect their industries , but protectionism distorts markets , said lamy , adding that he would monitor legislation in various countries which might violate wto rules .
he urged the us senate to be careful when it voted on a stimulus bill , already passed in the house of representatives , which did contain some " buy american " elements .
with the international monetary fund predicting the weakest year of growth since the second world war , there was real concern over measures which might impede commerce needed to get the world economy out of the downturn .
warning of social unrest france 's finance minister christine lagarde said the two greatest concerns were social unrest and protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .
several politicians openly stated they were under pressure from businesses at home to take big steps towards protecting local enterprises .
at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .
many hopes were pinned on the upcoming meeting of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- in april in london , with expectations that the major emerging economies will have to be part of a solution in such a global crisis .
there were repeated calls , from indian to british officials , to take steps to boost the imf and other international institutions .
japan said it was ready to give 1 $ 00 billion to the fund , which itself has asked for $ 250 billion .
however , it was clear most leaders did not feel there was a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the problems and each state would have to take right steps for its economy .
an era of humility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton said making less money could be a good thing no one was willing to predict when the crisis would end , or even bottom out .
the optimists would only say that eventually things would work out , though changes would be made .
" people will still make money but not like in past decade , and that 's a good thing , " said former us president bill clinton .
regulation would likely get tougher both on existing banks and all financial institutions .
" if it walks as a bank and quacks like a bank it needs to be regulated like a bank , " said peter sands of britain 's standard chartered bank .

but for the already humbled , the world 's poorest or " bottom billion " people , times might get tougher as they will lack both the capital and the credit to stimulate their economies , while the industries they depend on are likely to be hard hit .

but there were few signs that a sideline meeting saturday of trade ministers from about 20 countries had managed to push ahead the long-stalled doha round of trade talks , meant to create freer markets .
" throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not right , " said world trade organization director general pascal lamy .
" trade is not the cause of crisis . "
the concerns over protectionism - measures such as tariffs which would place restrains on trade - were sparked by the harsh reminders that isolationist policies in response to the market crash of 1929 wreaked havoc and in part created the harshness of the great depression .
nations could take steps to protect their industries , but protectionism distorts markets , said lamy , adding that he would monitor legislation in various countries which might violate wto rules .
he urged the us senate to be careful when it voted on a stimulus bill , already passed in the house of representatives , which did contain some " buy american " elements .
with the international monetary fund predicting the weakest year of growth since the second world war , there was real concern over measures which might impede commerce needed to get the world economy out of the downturn .
warning of social unrest france 's finance minister christine lagarde said the two greatest concerns were social unrest and protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .

at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .
many hopes were pinned on the upcoming meeting of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- in april in london , with expectations that the major emerging economies will have to be part of a solution in such a global crisis .
there were repeated calls , from indian to british officials , to take steps to boost the imf and other international institutions .
japan said it was ready to give 1 $ 00 billion to the fund , which itself has asked for $ 250 billion .
however , it was clear most leaders did not feel there was a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the problems and each state would have to take right steps for its economy .

" we will start a global redesign initiative in next few weeks , " schwab said in an impromptu statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab says the overhaul of the global financial system will take time " it has the support of almost every political leader who was here " at davos in the past five days , said schwab , naming specifically un secretary general ban ki-moon and chinese prime minister wen jiabao as backers .
he said the upcoming meeting in april of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- would not be enough to solve the global economic crisis .
" it wo n't address the totality of the issues , " schwab said , adding it could at best deal with " technical " matters .
he said there needed to be a systemic redesign of the global banking system , financial regulation and corporate governance .
" the key is global cooperation , " schwab stated later , " not only among government but among all the stakeholders of our society . "
what happened at davos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davos is the world 's foremost gathering of business and government leaders the world economic forum for 2009 ended with many asking what was really accomplished during the five days many of the world 's political and economic leaders gathered in the frigid swiss village of davos .
in his concluding remarks at the end of an engaging session on the future of the economy with key economic players , the journalist martin wolf summed up many people 's thought by saying that while no one knew exactly what needed to be done , something needed to be done and fast .
it was also apparent that things were - in the mantra of our times - about to change .
the financial and economic systems would look different , more regulated and controlled , and with better governance .
while people would still get rich , the scale of wealth would diminish .
fitting for what britain 's gordon brown termed the first crisis of the global era , the importance of international institutions and global cooperation were emphasized as key components to getting the world out of the economic downturn .
blaming the bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalists see davos as part of the problem there was anger at the bankers and the inventors of the complex derivatives that helped lead the world into the crisis and upset that the governments were being reactive and moving too slowly .
but some felt there was a unique chance for change and build a better system of economics , in part based on the concept of a " green economy , " just in time for the international meeting at the end of the year when countries will try to agree on an aggressive global environmental convention .
the world 's top brass gathered at davos to conclude they did n't know what to do exactly but , possibly using some idea floated at the forum , were determined , maybe optimistically , to get the economy back on track in 2010 .
success , though , will depend on how well they perform in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it wo n't address the totality of the issues , " schwab said , adding it could at best deal with " technical " matters .
he said there needed to be a systemic redesign of the global banking system , financial regulation and corporate governance .
" the key is global cooperation , " schwab stated later , " not only among government but among all the stakeholders of our society . "
what happened at davos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davos is the world 's foremost gathering of business and government leaders the world economic forum for 2009 ended with many asking what was really accomplished during the five days many of the world 's political and economic leaders gathered in the frigid swiss village of davos .
in his concluding remarks at the end of an engaging session on the future of the economy with key economic players , the journalist martin wolf summed up many people 's thought by saying that while no one knew exactly what needed to be done , something needed to be done and fast .
it was also apparent that things were - in the mantra of our times - about to change .
the financial and economic systems would look different , more regulated and controlled , and with better governance .
while people would still get rich , the scale of wealth would diminish .
fitting for what britain 's gordon brown termed the first crisis of the global era , the importance of international institutions and global cooperation were emphasized as key components to getting the world out of the economic downturn .
blaming the bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalists see davos as part of the problem there was anger at the bankers and the inventors of the complex derivatives that helped lead the world into the crisis and upset that the governments were being reactive and moving too slowly .
but some felt there was a unique chance for change and build a better system of economics , in part based on the concept of a " green economy , " just in time for the international meeting at the end of the year when countries will try to agree on an aggressive global environmental convention .
the world 's top brass gathered at davos to conclude they did n't know what to do exactly but , possibly using some idea floated at the forum , were determined , maybe optimistically , to get the economy back on track in 2010 .
success , though , will depend on how well they perform in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting was , nonetheless , a success , says deutsche welle 's michael knigge . if you expected concrete measures for the solution of the global economic crisis and a schedule for their implementation , you will have to consider the world economic forum in davos a failure .
now that the summit is over , the way out of the economic crisis is still not any clearer than it was before the meeting in switzerland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael knigge certainly , there were enough suggestions : german chancellor angela merkel advocated the creation of an international economic council as the new controlling body , which - just like the security council - would be residing at the united nations .
economists nouriel roubini and nassim taleb - famous for their pessimistic but accurate forecasts - demanded the full privatization of banks .
and british prime minister gordon brown spoke up , like several other participants , in favor of strengthening the world bank and the international monetary fund .
but the question of how these ideas should be practically implemented and how long this would take remained unanswered .
and that for a good reason : many propositions contradicted each other , either in parts or fully .
this made the most important element of any solution for the world economic crisis - a global consensus on the methods - impossible to reach .
one should , nevertheless , consider the world economic forum a success .
seeing managers and politicians discussing issues and fighting each other , witnessing business bosses and ministers trying to get a grip on the roots and development of the crisis , and sensing the uncertainty of the elites about the future , one could only conclude : the time for solutions was not yet ripe .
instead of adopting a master plan with concrete steps for the future , davos delegates had systematic analysis , collective wound-licking and mutual soul-massage as the order of the day .
for the first time since the beginning of the crisis , business and political leaders could thoroughly share and exchange opinions with one another in the midst of the swiss alps .
in a certain way , the world economic forum functioned as a global psycho-couch .
that may not be satisfactory from the point of few of the people all over the world who are suffering from the economic crisis .
but without accepting and coming to terms with a crisis - that 's what any wanna-be psychologist will tell you - no breakthrough will be possible .
if an important part of getting to understand and evaluate the crisis took part in davos , then the world economic forum was a success .
a breakthrough would have to happen at the latest at the london g-20 summit in april .

" we will start a global redesign initiative in next few weeks , " schwab said in an impromptu statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab says the overhaul of the global financial system will take time " it has the support of almost every political leader who was here " at davos in the past five days , said schwab , naming specifically un secretary general ban ki-moon and chinese prime minister wen jiabao as backers .
he said the upcoming meeting in april of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- would not be enough to solve the global economic crisis .
" it wo n't address the totality of the issues , " schwab said , adding it could at best deal with " technical " matters .
he said there needed to be a systemic redesign of the global banking system , financial regulation and corporate governance .
" the key is global cooperation , " schwab stated later , " not only among government but among all the stakeholders of our society . "
what happened at davos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davos is the world 's foremost gathering of business and government leaders the world economic forum for 2009 ended with many asking what was really accomplished during the five days many of the world 's political and economic leaders gathered in the frigid swiss village of davos .
in his concluding remarks at the end of an engaging session on the future of the economy with key economic players , the journalist martin wolf summed up many people 's thought by saying that while no one knew exactly what needed to be done , something needed to be done and fast .
it was also apparent that things were - in the mantra of our times - about to change .
the financial and economic systems would look different , more regulated and controlled , and with better governance .
while people would still get rich , the scale of wealth would diminish .
fitting for what britain 's gordon brown termed the first crisis of the global era , the importance of international institutions and global cooperation were emphasized as key components to getting the world out of the economic downturn .
blaming the bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalists see davos as part of the problem there was anger at the bankers and the inventors of the complex derivatives that helped lead the world into the crisis and upset that the governments were being reactive and moving too slowly .
but some felt there was a unique chance for change and build a better system of economics , in part based on the concept of a " green economy , " just in time for the international meeting at the end of the year when countries will try to agree on an aggressive global environmental convention .
the world 's top brass gathered at davos to conclude they did n't know what to do exactly but , possibly using some idea floated at the forum , were determined , maybe optimistically , to get the economy back on track in 2010 .
success , though , will depend on how well they perform in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , they 've concluded that he died shortly after being shot with a flint-tipped arrow .

the lesion from the blow was just below the arrow strike . " we 're now able to provide information about the age and sequence of wounds , " said nerlich in munich . a deep cut in the iceman 's hand , which has already been studied in the past , happened several days earlier , possibly in an accident with his flint knife .

" we will start a global redesign initiative in next few weeks , " schwab said in an impromptu statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab says the overhaul of the global financial system will take time " it has the support of almost every political leader who was here " at davos in the past five days , said schwab , naming specifically un secretary general ban ki-moon and chinese prime minister wen jiabao as backers .
he said the upcoming meeting in april of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- would not be enough to solve the global economic crisis .
" it wo n't address the totality of the issues , " schwab said , adding it could at best deal with " technical " matters .
he said there needed to be a systemic redesign of the global banking system , financial regulation and corporate governance .
" the key is global cooperation , " schwab stated later , " not only among government but among all the stakeholders of our society . "
what happened at davos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : davos is the world 's foremost gathering of business and government leaders the world economic forum for 2009 ended with many asking what was really accomplished during the five days many of the world 's political and economic leaders gathered in the frigid swiss village of davos .
in his concluding remarks at the end of an engaging session on the future of the economy with key economic players , the journalist martin wolf summed up many people 's thought by saying that while no one knew exactly what needed to be done , something needed to be done and fast .
it was also apparent that things were - in the mantra of our times - about to change .
the financial and economic systems would look different , more regulated and controlled , and with better governance .
while people would still get rich , the scale of wealth would diminish .
fitting for what britain 's gordon brown termed the first crisis of the global era , the importance of international institutions and global cooperation were emphasized as key components to getting the world out of the economic downturn .
blaming the bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalists see davos as part of the problem there was anger at the bankers and the inventors of the complex derivatives that helped lead the world into the crisis and upset that the governments were being reactive and moving too slowly .
but some felt there was a unique chance for change and build a better system of economics , in part based on the concept of a " green economy , " just in time for the international meeting at the end of the year when countries will try to agree on an aggressive global environmental convention .
the world 's top brass gathered at davos to conclude they did n't know what to do exactly but , possibly using some idea floated at the forum , were determined , maybe optimistically , to get the economy back on track in 2010 .
success , though , will depend on how well they perform in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

blaming the bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalists see davos as part of the problem there was anger at the bankers and the inventors of the complex derivatives that helped lead the world into the crisis and upset that the governments were being reactive and moving too slowly .
but some felt there was a unique chance for change and build a better system of economics , in part based on the concept of a " green economy , " just in time for the international meeting at the end of the year when countries will try to agree on an aggressive global environmental convention .
the world 's top brass gathered at davos to conclude they did n't know what to do exactly but , possibly using some idea floated at the forum , were determined , maybe optimistically , to get the economy back on track in 2010 .

" germany will still have no straightforward , transparent and unbureaucratic environmental law in one piece , " environment minister sigmar gabriel said in a statement on sunday .
" the existing fragmentation will remain in place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister gabriel has blamed his coalition partners each of germany 's 16 states has its own set of regulations on issues such as pollution , which makes the approval process for firms planning new projects like roads or factories highly bureaucratic and complex .
the environment minister , of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , was critical of the internal political wranglings inherent to the process by which individual state approval is sought for proposals to pass .
bavaria , led by the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- sister party of chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , ultimately did n't approve the draft law , criticizing it for adding another layer of bureaucracy for companies seeking environmental certification .
the project failed " due to a hollow lack of reform and blind blocking policies of the union , " gabriel said .
states are in charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel proposed a new set of regulations two decades ago in the 1980s , a decision was made to try and simplify the country 's environmental regulations .
in 1997 , then environment minister angela merkel - now chancellor - proposed a new , one-size-fits-all set of regulations to speed things up .
when merkel 's conservatives and the social democrats formed the ruling " grand coalition " in 2005 , it was something both parties promised they would make happen .
the government was also hoping that less red tape would help speed up the billions of euros worth of infrastructure projects with which berlin aims to pull europe 's biggest economy out of its worst post-war recession .
party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2009 parliamentary elections pose a major problem for the coalition government with seven months to go before general elections - when both parties aim to ditch the other and form a coalition with another party - gabriel said that the agreement was impossible in the current legislative period .
gabriel , who is from the spd , said that with a lack of readiness to compromise the cdu / csu - which in turn blamed gabriel - was " damaging the economy and the environment at the same time . "
the german branch of friends of the earth , bund , said there was now a danger of a " race to the bottom " among german states to relax environmental regulations in order to attract investment . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in six episodes , arts.21 charts the evolution of reunified germany with reference to six works created between 1989 and 2009 that reflect the country 's main preoccupations . episode 1 : " blossoming landscapes " – christian wolter 's post-reunification photograph series bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wolter , ' blossoming landscapes ' it was during the period of reunification that chancellor helmut kohl coined what has since become an infamous phrase : forecasting growth in the former east within just a few years he promised the emergence of " blossoming landscapes " .
15 years later , photographer christian wolter set out to see what progress had been made and called his series " blühende landschaften " – inspired by helmut kohl 's premature promise .
a slick-looking and very expensive climbing tower in wolfen – nord , a satellite town created to house east german chemical workers , is the subject of one of his photographs .
not a soul was in sight on the day when christian wolter took his picture .
the tower is rarely used because local people can not afford the equipment needed to climb it .
wolter 's series is a catalogue of ill-advised investments and post-industrial ruins in eastern and western germany – and a testimony to unfulfilled post-reunification promises . episode 2 : welcome to capitalism – " old europe " by artist johannes spehr bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes spehr , ' living pproject old europe / living in humus ' the frankfurt-based artist johannes spehr specializes in small monochrome drawings that look something like scenes from comic strips .
at first glance , they might seem anodyne , but they are n't !
take a closer look and the fine satirical detail of these drawings will suck you into a world full of symbolism .
in the work living project old europe / living in humus we see a man who has settled into his own grave .
spehr shows a country without a vision .
capitalism has won and yet is not victorious .
there are no longer any goals , there is only the fear of losing what we have .
in spite of globalization , people are retreating to the trenches . episode 3 : utopia : the vanished pictures series by photographer margret hoppe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margret hoppe , ' werner tübke , five continents ' , 1959 - interhotel astoria , leipzig the title of one photograph in this series by the leipzig-trained margret hoppe is " werner tübke , five continents , 1959 , oil on wood , interhotel astoria , leipzig . "
when we look at this photograph we see nothing – or , rather , not much .
an empty room , a cracked ceiling , a scuffed floor .
but five rectangular patches on the wall , with holes where screws have been removed , suggest something was attached here .
for her " vanished pictures " series margret hoppe revisits public spaces in what used to be east germany .
her works show the gaps that were left after most socialist artworks were removed in reunified germany .
hoppe 's photographs document how the visual memory of communist east germany is being lost and with it the cultural inheritance of this era . episode 4 : confronting the past : peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eisenman , holocaust memorial in berlin how do germans look at their history , twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall ?
perhaps no work of art gives a clearer answer than this berlin landmark .
only completed after 17 years of discussion , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe designed by american architect peter eisenman is dedicated to the victims of the nazi holocaust .
from a distance the field of steles , or upright concrete slabs of differing height , looks almost poetic , reminiscent of a small stone forest .
but the moment you step into the concrete woods , you 're overcome with the feeling that you will never find your way out .
the light of day is near , yet impossibly far away .
it 's rare that a monument affects visitors like germany 's holocaust memorial .
some visitors move forlornly through the stone field , others sit on top of the slabs , while children climb around on them .
hardly any other architectural creation in germany is subject to as much interpretation and emotion as this spot – even though , or perhaps precisely because – on the surface , at least , eisenman shunned symbolism .
the site remains a place of confrontation . episode 5 : " reserve " by kerstin drechsel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin drechsel , ' reserve ' we are in a cluttered apartment full of books , clothes and wrappers .
only a small area of the bed is not occupied .
but this is not garbage , what we see are piles of consumer goods - substitutes for human relationships .
artist kerstin drechsel 's enormous oil canvases are intimate portraits that do not show the actual occupants .
the apartment as retreat , a refuge for disorder in an otherwise tidy country . episode 6 : paule hammer 's " ausflug " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hammer , ' der ausflug ' 2005 a young , ape-like man in a t-shirt and jeans sits on a motorcycle and revs the engine .
but the man in paule hammer 's painting wears no protective gear and the garage door is closed : he 'll be driving right into the door .
hammer 's provocative work seems to holds up a mirror to society , arguing that though we may think we are on a great journey , we are in fact trapped in a small , narrow-minded country . episode 7 : power and violence : " dog planet " by daniel richter this is a belligerent picture .
the dogs bare their teeth , heavily armed police officers raise their clubs threateningly , with a quick pose for the camera .
the strange color contrasts suggest it is an infrared camera .
daniel richter says his works are not the products of his imagination , but are based on reality .
the painting " dog planet " seems to show a nightmarish , brutalized world .
daniel richter 's subversive look at germany .

but there were few signs that a sideline meeting saturday of trade ministers from about 20 countries had managed to push ahead the long-stalled doha round of trade talks , meant to create freer markets .
" throwing out the baby with the bathwater is not right , " said world trade organization director general pascal lamy .
" trade is not the cause of crisis . "
the concerns over protectionism - measures such as tariffs which would place restrains on trade - were sparked by the harsh reminders that isolationist policies in response to the market crash of 1929 wreaked havoc and in part created the harshness of the great depression .
nations could take steps to protect their industries , but protectionism distorts markets , said lamy , adding that he would monitor legislation in various countries which might violate wto rules .
he urged the us senate to be careful when it voted on a stimulus bill , already passed in the house of representatives , which did contain some " buy american " elements .
with the international monetary fund predicting the weakest year of growth since the second world war , there was real concern over measures which might impede commerce needed to get the world economy out of the downturn .
warning of social unrest france 's finance minister christine lagarde said the two greatest concerns were social unrest and protectionism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagarde warned that the crisis could lead to social unrest the trick would be finding a way to stimulate national economies without overstepping trade rules , while also , as lagarde said , making sure planned actions were properly articulated to domestic constituents .
several politicians openly stated they were under pressure from businesses at home to take big steps towards protecting local enterprises .
at the world economic forum , the common mantra was that while there was an understanding that something needed to be done , and fast , it was still unclear exactly what that something might be .
some ideas were floated to get lending back on track , including pumping liquidity into banks and markets and putting so-called " toxic assets " into bad banks in order to free up the balance books of financial institutions .
one agreed-upon point was the need for increased international cooperation .
many hopes were pinned on the upcoming meeting of the group of 20 industrialized economies -lrb- g20 -rrb- in april in london , with expectations that the major emerging economies will have to be part of a solution in such a global crisis .
there were repeated calls , from indian to british officials , to take steps to boost the imf and other international institutions .
japan said it was ready to give 1 $ 00 billion to the fund , which itself has asked for $ 250 billion .
however , it was clear most leaders did not feel there was a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the problems and each state would have to take right steps for its economy .
an era of humility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bill clinton said making less money could be a good thing no one was willing to predict when the crisis would end , or even bottom out .
the optimists would only say that eventually things would work out , though changes would be made .
" people will still make money but not like in past decade , and that 's a good thing , " said former us president bill clinton .
regulation would likely get tougher both on existing banks and all financial institutions .
" if it walks as a bank and quacks like a bank it needs to be regulated like a bank , " said peter sands of britain 's standard chartered bank .
several business leaders said they were simply waiting for the proverbial other shoe to fall , such as when it became clear how badly hedge funds were affected .
the financial world was entering , in the words of a private investor , " a new era of humility . "
but for the already humbled , the world 's poorest or " bottom billion " people , times might get tougher as they will lack both the capital and the credit to stimulate their economies , while the industries they depend on are likely to be hard hit .
a vulnerability fund world bank president robert zoellick suggested that the industrialized world should put aside 0.7 per cent of their stimulus packages for a " vulnerability fund " for developing countries suffering in the global downturn .
he urged against leaving the weakest " out in the cold . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon urged for aid for the developing world to be maintained similarly , ban ki-moon , the un 's secretary general , called for maintaining aid to the developing world , even in times of crisis .
like others , he also said an eye should be kept on the ball in regards to climate change , particularly with countries set to gather at the end of the year in an attempt to pass an aggressive environmental accord .
if the economy were to " go green , " jobs could be created , spurring some recovery , many leaders including ban noted . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thirty years ago , religious leader ayatollah khomeini returned to iran from exile and launched an islamic revolution .
the bbc 's john simpson was on the plane that flew the ayatollah to tehran .
in the village of neauphle-le-chateau , outside paris , not an awful lot has changed in the past 30 years .
the street , the gardens , even the green wooden gate which ayatollah khomeini used to pass through on his way to prayer , are all there still - though his headquarters was blown up not long after he went back to iran .
catastrophic misjudgement but 30 years have seen immense changes in the world outside neauphle , of course , and what happened in this quiet place played a significant part in that process .
when the revolutionary disturbances of 1978 broke out , ayatollah khomeini was being kept under tight control as an exile in the shia holy city of najaf , in iraq .
iraq was already being run by saddam hussein .
then the shah of iran asked saddam to expel him .
it was a catastrophic misjudgement .
the ayatollah flew to france , and could suddenly speak to the entire world . "
a journalist asked what he felt , going back after so many years of exile .
' nothing , ' he replied " in four months at neauphle , he did 132 interviews ; not bad for a man of 78 .
with his ferocity and refusal to compromise , he gained an international stature .
when the shah eventually left iran , in january 1979 , the way was open for the ayatollah to fly home and overthrow the imperial system .
i managed to get a couple of tickets for his charter flight , for a cameraman and myself .
the bbc ordered me not to go , but i could not resist the excitement , and went anyway .
it quickly seemed like a bad call .
during the flight , one of the ayatollah 's officials announced that the iranian air force , which was still loyal to the shah , was planning to shoot us down when we entered iran 's air space .
we journalists were a bit subdued by that , but the revolutionary activists who filled the rest of the seats cheered and wept ; they wanted to become martyrs .
islamic republic established we went forward to film the ayatollah as he sat in first class .
he looked out of the window and ignored us until a journalist asked what he felt , going back after so many years of exile .
" nothing , " he replied .
we were not shot down , of course .
instead , we circled over tehran airport , while the final negotiations with the authorities below dragged on and we all got airsick .
then we landed , and the ayatollah was greeted by what some say is probably the largest crowd in human history .
the islamic republic was duly established in iran ; muslim opinion around the world was galvanised ; and a major new focus of opposition to western liberalism took shape .
and the whole thing was planned in a french village , where a traffic jam or a fall of snow is usually something to talk about for days .

thirty years ago , religious leader ayatollah khomeini returned to iran from exile and launched an islamic revolution .
the bbc 's john simpson was on the plane that flew the ayatollah to tehran .
in the village of neauphle-le-chateau , outside paris , not an awful lot has changed in the past 30 years .
the street , the gardens , even the green wooden gate which ayatollah khomeini used to pass through on his way to prayer , are all there still - though his headquarters was blown up not long after he went back to iran .
catastrophic misjudgement but 30 years have seen immense changes in the world outside neauphle , of course , and what happened in this quiet place played a significant part in that process .
when the revolutionary disturbances of 1978 broke out , ayatollah khomeini was being kept under tight control as an exile in the shia holy city of najaf , in iraq .
iraq was already being run by saddam hussein .
then the shah of iran asked saddam to expel him .
it was a catastrophic misjudgement .
the ayatollah flew to france , and could suddenly speak to the entire world .
a journalist asked what he felt , going back after so many years of exile .
' nothing , ' he replied in four months at neauphle , he did 132 interviews ; not bad for a man of 78 .
with his ferocity and refusal to compromise , he gained an international stature .
when the shah eventually left iran , in january 1979 , the way was open for the ayatollah to fly home and overthrow the imperial system .
i managed to get a couple of tickets for his charter flight , for a cameraman and myself .
the bbc ordered me not to go , but i could not resist the excitement , and went anyway .
it quickly seemed like a bad call .
during the flight , one of the ayatollah 's officials announced that the iranian air force , which was still loyal to the shah , was planning to shoot us down when we entered iran 's air space .
we journalists were a bit subdued by that , but the revolutionary activists who filled the rest of the seats cheered and wept ; they wanted to become martyrs .
islamic republic established we went forward to film the ayatollah as he sat in first class .
he looked out of the window and ignored us until a journalist asked what he felt , going back after so many years of exile .
" nothing , " he replied .
we were not shot down , of course .
instead , we circled over tehran airport , while the final negotiations with the authorities below dragged on and we all got airsick .

the finding comes despite the authors saying children have better education , health and more possessions .
it states children need to be loved and sets out recommendations to parents , teachers and the government on how they can better care for children .
the sunday times says the children 's society report had 35,000 contributors .
problems the document , entitled a good childhood - which is due out on monday - also backs traditional families , saying that by the age of three , children of single parents are three times more likely to have behavioural problems .
child psychologist laverne antrobus told bbc news that children are likely to let their parents know when they are not happy .
she said : " i think as a parent you 're never quite sure if you 're doing the right thing actually .
but children can , under certain circumstances if the environment 's not right for them , they let you know through their behaviour . "
the study also suggests children of single-parent families are twice as likely to experience poor conceptual development compared with those with married parents .
the report 's recommendations include the introduction of a civil birth ceremony and the possibility for parents to take three-years ' leave , with a guaranteed return to work .
lincolnshire mother sarah parish said she refused to believe her children suffered as a result of her job .
" i wanted to find me again and have something for me as well as the children . "
what would we do if our aim was a world based on love ? "
a good childhood report " i enjoy my job , i knew they would be no worse off at nursery as they are at home with me .
i do miss them incredibly but i make sure i spend time with them and do the things they enjoy doing as well , " she said .
the report also looks at what it describes as " a massive change in our way of life " - the fact that 70 % of mothers now work , compared with around a quarter 25 years ago - and that one in three 16-year-olds now live apart from their father .
the sunday times quotes the report as stating a key factor in the increased difficulties faced by children is the " excessively individualistic ethos " of contemporary british society .
have your say " my kids have it much easier than i did at their age .
it helps when you have someone looking out for your best interest . "
maureen , florida send us your comments the paper says the report calls for " a radical shift away from the excessively individualistic ethos which now prevails , to an ethos where the constant question is , ' what would we do if our aim was a world based on love ? " '
the paper reports the study is endorsed by the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams and that it is independent , but commissioned by the church of england-affiliated children 's society .

child psychologist laverne antrobus : ' i think that parents can feel very guilty ' child psychologist laverne antrobus told bbc news that children are likely to let their parents know when they are not happy .
she said : " i think as a parent you 're never quite sure if you 're doing the right thing actually .
but children can , under certain circumstances if the environment 's not right for them , they let you know through their behaviour . "
the study also suggests children of single-parent families are twice as likely to experience poor conceptual development compared with those with married parents .
the report 's recommendations include the introduction of a civil birth ceremony and the possibility for parents to take three-years ' leave , with a guaranteed return to work .
lincolnshire mother sarah parish said she refused to believe her children suffered as a result of her job .
" i wanted to find me again and have something for me as well as the children .
what would we do if our aim was a world based on love ?
a good childhood report " i enjoy my job , i knew they would be no worse off at nursery as they are at home with me .
i do miss them incredibly but i make sure i spend time with them and do the things they enjoy doing as well , " she said .
the report also looks at what it describes as " a massive change in our way of life " - the fact that 70 % of mothers now work , compared with around a quarter 25 years ago - and that one in three 16-year-olds now live apart from their father .
the sunday times quotes the report as stating a key factor in the increased difficulties faced by children is the " excessively individualistic ethos " of contemporary british society .
