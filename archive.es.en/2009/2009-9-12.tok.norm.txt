their appearance at the event was enough for the official chinese delegation to walk out . the two writers travelled to frankfurt though their invitations to the symposium had been revoked after criticism from beijing .
when bei ling and dai qing on saturday addressed the symposium , the official chinese delegation left the room in protest . the delegation returned only after an apology from juergen boos , organizer of the book fair .
mei zhaorong , former chinese ambassador to germany , said the german hosts had changed the program of the symposium without informing the delegation from beijing . " we did not come here for a lesson in democracy , " mei said .
" those times are over . " the two dissident authors in turn expressed their disappointment at the chinese reaction , saying that such behavior would undermine any constructive discussion . the symposium , entitled " china and the world - perception and reality , " was initially intended to clear up prejudices about the guest country - china - ahead of the 2009 frankfurt book fair , which begins in mid-october . the event had been intended as a promotional preamble but soon became a pr nightmare when china made it clear that if the organizers persisted in including dissident writers , it would pull out of the symposium altogether . the fair 's organizers bowed to chinese pressure and bei ling , dai qing and several other dissident authors found that their invitations had been revoked . dai qing 's last minute flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bei ling is planning to attend the book fair in october dai qing , considered to be one of china 's leading investigative journalists and environmental activists , managed to get a german visa as the guest of the german branch of the pen club of independent writers . when dai got to the airport , however , she found that her plane ticket had been mysteriously cancelled , despite the fact that she 'd twice phoned the travel company to confirm . " they tried so hard to keep me from frankfurt , " dai said ahead of the symposium . " when you hold an international symposium in frankfurt , it should be about giving chinese authors a voice when the central theme is chinese literature , " she added . " the authorities must give some clear arguments as to why i should n't be allowed to express my thoughts . " frankfurt book fair under fire the organizers of the world 's largest book fair have come under heavy criticism from writers and politicians alike .
however , the director of the frankfurt book fair defended the decision to revoke symposium invitations as a necessary compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boos said compromises are necessary china might have its way at the symposium , fair director juergen boos argued , but the annual book fair would be a different matter .
" content at the frankfurt book fair can not be supervised , " he said . this assurance is , however , unlikely to satisfy the author bei ling , who feels that the affair has seriously damaged the event 's credibility . bei was arrested in china in 2000 for " illegal publications " but was released shortly afterward following us intervention .
he had been planning to speak about censorship and self-censorship at the symposium . " i feel it is a shame if the frankfurt book fair can not say ' no ' or they can not control this , " bei told the dpa news agency .

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?
who will ask the questions ?

long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .

both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .

although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.09.2009 eu delegation meets mugabe in landmark visit to zimbabwe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe welcomed the eu delegation " with open arms " zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe on saturday welcomed the first high-level european union delegation to his country in seven years and said talks on implementing a power-sharing deal went well . " we welcome you with open arms .
we hope our talks will be fruitful with a positive outcome , " mugabe said in the capital harare on saturday .
the eu delegation led by karel de gucht , eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , and the swedish eu presidency was also to hold talks with mugabe 's long-time political rival , morgan tsvangirai . the visit is the first since the eu began targeted sanctions in 2002 against members of mugabe 's government for human rights violations .
it marks a thawing in ties between western powers and zimbabwe .
eu officials have described the visit as an attempt to reopen political dialogue with the country . " this is a critical time for zimbabwe and the weight of responsibility falls squarely on the country 's leaders to deliver urgent political , economic and social progress for the benefit of all people of zimbabwe , " de gucht said in a statement ahead of the visit . zimbabwe says it needs $ 10 billion in foreign reconstruction aid .
but western nations are willing to commit further aid without further political and economic reforms as part of a power-sharing deal called the global political agreement -lrb- gpa -rrb- . eu reaffirms sanctions policy a day before the visit , eu officials were forced to defend the bloc 's decision of sticking to sanctions against mugabe and his inner circle . " we are not talking about economic sanctions , " karel de gucht said at the second eu-south africa summit in cape town on friday . de gucht said that the sanctions imposed in 2002 targeted individuals and that they had no impact on the general population . he was responding to calls made at a summit of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- leaders earlier this week .
african leaders meeting in kinshasa had demanded that the zimbabwe sanctions be lifted , arguing that they were obstructing the country 's economic recovery . the eu and the us have said they will not lift sanctions until zimbabwe implements further reforms , especially in the field of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says zimbabweans are suffering because of homegrown mismanagement swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , pointed out that human rights abuses continued in zimbabwe , including violence directed at supporters of prime minister morgan tsvangirai . " it is not the restrictions that are creating the problems in zimbabwe , it is the mismanagement … not respecting human rights , " said reinfeldt in the south african town of kleinmond , where the summit was taking place . the eu and us implemented the targeted sanctions in 2002 following a disputed presidential poll that extended mugabe 's rule . mugabe 's blame game mugabe has tried to make people believe that zimbabwe 's domestic problems are solely due to western sanctions and that once these are lifted the country will get back on its feet . however , while south african president jacob zuma said the sanctions were obstructing a successful power-sharing deal , he stressed during the summit with eu diplomats that zimbabwe 's problems were older than the sanctions . " i do n't think the sanctions started the problems in the economy .
i think it was the zimbabweans who undermined their own system .
that got the economy into trouble , " said zuma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zuma was unable to sway eu diplomats over the zimbabwe sanctions however , while eu and south african officials differed on the sanctions issue , they did agree on a joint communique in which they urged zimbabwe 's parties to " remove all obstacles " to the country 's power sharing deal and unity government . zimbabweans had hoped the power-sharing deal agreed to by prime minister morgan tsvangirai and president robert mugabe would pave the way for the country 's recovery under a unity government . the deal , which came into effect in february , managed to defuse the violence that ensued after last year 's disputed presidential election , but it has done little to actually change the country 's economic or humanitarian predicament .
power struggles over key posts in the government continue as do human rights abuses and food shortages . mugabe lashes out at west the 85-year-old mugabe reacted promptly to the eu 's announcement that sanctions would remain in place .
speaking at a gathering of his party 's youth wing in harare on friday , he slammed the sanctions and the west . " who said the british and americans should rule over others ? … we have not invited these bloody whites .
they want to poke their nose into our affairs .
refuse that , " mugabe said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's population depends heavily on foreign aid shipments mugabe also made clear on friday that he is still unwilling to back down on controversial land reforms which he implemented in the former british colony nine years ago . " the land reform exercise is irreversible , " mugabe said . mugabe 's government launched the land reforms in a bid to redress colonial grievances .
in the chaotic process that followed white farmers were often violently driven off their property and the land given to black farmers . since then these hitherto productive and efficient farms have often been badly run , which has contributed strongly to the fact that zimbabwe , once africa 's bread basket , is now struggling against food shortages , disease , poverty and hyperinflation . nk / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we welcome you with open arms .
we hope our talks will be fruitful with a positive outcome , " mugabe said in the capital harare on saturday .
the eu delegation led by karel de gucht , eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , and the swedish eu presidency was also to hold talks with mugabe 's long-time political rival , morgan tsvangirai . the visit is the first since the eu began targeted sanctions in 2002 against members of mugabe 's government for human rights violations .
it marks a thawing in ties between western powers and zimbabwe .
eu officials have described the visit as an attempt to reopen political dialogue with the country . " this is a critical time for zimbabwe and the weight of responsibility falls squarely on the country 's leaders to deliver urgent political , economic and social progress for the benefit of all people of zimbabwe , " de gucht said in a statement ahead of the visit . zimbabwe says it needs $ 10 billion in foreign reconstruction aid .
but western nations are willing to commit further aid without further political and economic reforms as part of a power-sharing deal called the global political agreement -lrb- gpa -rrb- . eu reaffirms sanctions policy a day before the visit , eu officials were forced to defend the bloc 's decision of sticking to sanctions against mugabe and his inner circle . " we are not talking about economic sanctions , " karel de gucht said at the second eu-south africa summit in cape town on friday . de gucht said that the sanctions imposed in 2002 targeted individuals and that they had no impact on the general population . he was responding to calls made at a summit of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- leaders earlier this week .
african leaders meeting in kinshasa had demanded that the zimbabwe sanctions be lifted , arguing that they were obstructing the country 's economic recovery . the eu and the us have said they will not lift sanctions until zimbabwe implements further reforms , especially in the field of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says zimbabweans are suffering because of homegrown mismanagement swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , pointed out that human rights abuses continued in zimbabwe , including violence directed at supporters of prime minister morgan tsvangirai . " it is not the restrictions that are creating the problems in zimbabwe , it is the mismanagement … not respecting human rights , " said reinfeldt in the south african town of kleinmond , where the summit was taking place . the eu and us implemented the targeted sanctions in 2002 following a disputed presidential poll that extended mugabe 's rule . mugabe 's blame game mugabe has tried to make people believe that zimbabwe 's domestic problems are solely due to western sanctions and that once these are lifted the country will get back on its feet . however , while south african president jacob zuma said the sanctions were obstructing a successful power-sharing deal , he stressed during the summit with eu diplomats that zimbabwe 's problems were older than the sanctions . " i do n't think the sanctions started the problems in the economy .
i think it was the zimbabweans who undermined their own system .
that got the economy into trouble , " said zuma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zuma was unable to sway eu diplomats over the zimbabwe sanctions however , while eu and south african officials differed on the sanctions issue , they did agree on a joint communique in which they urged zimbabwe 's parties to " remove all obstacles " to the country 's power sharing deal and unity government . zimbabweans had hoped the power-sharing deal agreed to by prime minister morgan tsvangirai and president robert mugabe would pave the way for the country 's recovery under a unity government . the deal , which came into effect in february , managed to defuse the violence that ensued after last year 's disputed presidential election , but it has done little to actually change the country 's economic or humanitarian predicament .
power struggles over key posts in the government continue as do human rights abuses and food shortages . mugabe lashes out at west the 85-year-old mugabe reacted promptly to the eu 's announcement that sanctions would remain in place .
speaking at a gathering of his party 's youth wing in harare on friday , he slammed the sanctions and the west . " who said the british and americans should rule over others ? … we have not invited these bloody whites .
they want to poke their nose into our affairs .
refuse that , " mugabe said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's population depends heavily on foreign aid shipments mugabe also made clear on friday that he is still unwilling to back down on controversial land reforms which he implemented in the former british colony nine years ago . " the land reform exercise is irreversible , " mugabe said . mugabe 's government launched the land reforms in a bid to redress colonial grievances .
in the chaotic process that followed white farmers were often violently driven off their property and the land given to black farmers . since then these hitherto productive and efficient farms have often been badly run , which has contributed strongly to the fact that zimbabwe , once africa 's bread basket , is now struggling against food shortages , disease , poverty and hyperinflation . nk / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?
who will ask the questions ?
will the candidates be allowed to address each other ?
all of these issues , and dozens more , must be negotiated between the political parties and the debate 's sponsor .
german debate formats slow to innovate the original american debate format consisted of a panel of journalists posing consecutive questions to kennedy and nixon .
all presidential debates in the us between 1960 and 1988 employed this format , which germany 's debaters continue to use today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate between stoiber , left , and schröder was the first one-on-one duel , since then there 's been little change to the format german debate formats have been remarkably slow to innovate , the key exception being the structural change in 2002 that resulted in a one-on-one duel between schroder and stoiber .
the 2009 debates continue the tradition without significant changes , such as multimedia enhancements , mail-in questions or an interface for video-questions pre-produced by viewers at home .
the joint venture of public networks ard and zdf with private networks rtl and pro7.sat1 brings together four anchorpersons , each representing their own media network - and stealing time from the debate between the candidates .
the debate will be broadcast live by the participating television stations , but there ´ s no online coverage : the networks agreed not to offer live-streaming and will only put up an online video after the debate has finished .
other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .
no matter the format and no matter the country , campaign debates have shown themselves to be of great value to voters , imparting information about politicians and their positions in an audience-friendly way .
the challenge in germany and throughout the world is to ensure that debates are responsive to the needs of citizens first , and second to the needs of political candidates and the media .
after nearly 50 years of on-camera debates , this remains the key struggle .

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .
there , they picked up two russian icebreakers as escorts and headed to the dutch port of rotterdam . melting ice made journey possible the voyage , using the traditional route , is roughly 11,000 nautical miles -lrb- 12,658 miles -rrb- and passes through the suez canal .
by going over the top of the world , the freighters were able to cut 4,000 nautical miles from that trip .
the savings in fuel costs are substantial .
there is also an environmental benefit to be realized with a reduction in the amount of co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ships were accompanied by russian icebreakers in order to transit the northern sea , the company had to get permission from the rusian authorities .
when that permission came , the ships were escorted by the russian icebreaker " 50 years since victory . "
it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .
until now , the only vessels that had been traversing the passage were russian submarines and icebreakers. av / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their appearance at the event was enough for the official chinese delegation to walk out . the two writers travelled to frankfurt though their invitations to the symposium had been revoked after criticism from beijing .
when bei ling and dai qing on saturday addressed the symposium , the official chinese delegation left the room in protest . the delegation returned only after an apology from juergen boos , organizer of the book fair .

" those times are over . " the two dissident authors in turn expressed their disappointment at the chinese reaction , saying that such behavior would undermine any constructive discussion . the symposium , entitled " china and the world - perception and reality , " was initially intended to clear up prejudices about the guest country - china - ahead of the 2009 frankfurt book fair , which begins in mid-october . the event had been intended as a promotional preamble but soon became a pr nightmare when china made it clear that if the organizers persisted in including dissident writers , it would pull out of the symposium altogether . the fair 's organizers bowed to chinese pressure and bei ling , dai qing and several other dissident authors found that their invitations had been revoked . dai qing 's last minute flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bei ling is planning to attend the book fair in october dai qing , considered to be one of china 's leading investigative journalists and environmental activists , managed to get a german visa as the guest of the german branch of the pen club of independent writers . when dai got to the airport , however , she found that her plane ticket had been mysteriously cancelled , despite the fact that she 'd twice phoned the travel company to confirm . " they tried so hard to keep me from frankfurt , " dai said ahead of the symposium . " when you hold an international symposium in frankfurt , it should be about giving chinese authors a voice when the central theme is chinese literature , " she added . " the authorities must give some clear arguments as to why i should n't be allowed to express my thoughts .

" the two dissident authors in turn expressed their disappointment at the chinese reaction , saying that such behavior would undermine any constructive discussion . the symposium , entitled " china and the world - perception and reality , " was initially intended to clear up prejudices about the guest country - china - ahead of the 2009 frankfurt book fair , which begins in mid-october . the event had been intended as a promotional preamble but soon became a pr nightmare when china made it clear that if the organizers persisted in including dissident writers , it would pull out of the symposium altogether . the fair 's organizers bowed to chinese pressure and bei ling , dai qing and several other dissident authors found that their invitations had been revoked . dai qing 's last minute flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bei ling is planning to attend the book fair in october dai qing , considered to be one of china 's leading investigative journalists and environmental activists , managed to get a german visa as the guest of the german branch of the pen club of independent writers . when dai got to the airport , however , she found that her plane ticket had been mysteriously cancelled , despite the fact that she 'd twice phoned the travel company to confirm . " they tried so hard to keep me from frankfurt , " dai said ahead of the symposium . " when you hold an international symposium in frankfurt , it should be about giving chinese authors a voice when the central theme is chinese literature , " she added . " the authorities must give some clear arguments as to why i should n't be allowed to express my thoughts . " frankfurt book fair under fire the organizers of the world 's largest book fair have come under heavy criticism from writers and politicians alike .
however , the director of the frankfurt book fair defended the decision to revoke symposium invitations as a necessary compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boos said compromises are necessary china might have its way at the symposium , fair director juergen boos argued , but the annual book fair would be a different matter .
" content at the frankfurt book fair can not be supervised , " he said . this assurance is , however , unlikely to satisfy the author bei ling , who feels that the affair has seriously damaged the event 's credibility . bei was arrested in china in 2000 for " illegal publications " but was released shortly afterward following us intervention .
he had been planning to speak about censorship and self-censorship at the symposium . " i feel it is a shame if the frankfurt book fair can not say ' no ' or they can not control this , " bei told the dpa news agency .
" they decided this year for china to be the guest country , so they have to face all these complicated situations .
but some rules they can not turn back , like freedom of expression . " ai / kl / dpa / epd editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .

" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .

" we welcome you with open arms .
we hope our talks will be fruitful with a positive outcome , " mugabe said in the capital harare on saturday .
the eu delegation led by karel de gucht , eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , and the swedish eu presidency was also to hold talks with mugabe 's long-time political rival , morgan tsvangirai . the visit is the first since the eu began targeted sanctions in 2002 against members of mugabe 's government for human rights violations .
it marks a thawing in ties between western powers and zimbabwe .
eu officials have described the visit as an attempt to reopen political dialogue with the country . " this is a critical time for zimbabwe and the weight of responsibility falls squarely on the country 's leaders to deliver urgent political , economic and social progress for the benefit of all people of zimbabwe , " de gucht said in a statement ahead of the visit . zimbabwe says it needs $ 10 billion in foreign reconstruction aid .
but western nations are willing to commit further aid without further political and economic reforms as part of a power-sharing deal called the global political agreement -lrb- gpa -rrb- . eu reaffirms sanctions policy a day before the visit , eu officials were forced to defend the bloc 's decision of sticking to sanctions against mugabe and his inner circle . " we are not talking about economic sanctions , " karel de gucht said at the second eu-south africa summit in cape town on friday . de gucht said that the sanctions imposed in 2002 targeted individuals and that they had no impact on the general population . he was responding to calls made at a summit of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- leaders earlier this week .
african leaders meeting in kinshasa had demanded that the zimbabwe sanctions be lifted , arguing that they were obstructing the country 's economic recovery . the eu and the us have said they will not lift sanctions until zimbabwe implements further reforms , especially in the field of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says zimbabweans are suffering because of homegrown mismanagement swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , pointed out that human rights abuses continued in zimbabwe , including violence directed at supporters of prime minister morgan tsvangirai . " it is not the restrictions that are creating the problems in zimbabwe , it is the mismanagement … not respecting human rights , " said reinfeldt in the south african town of kleinmond , where the summit was taking place . the eu and us implemented the targeted sanctions in 2002 following a disputed presidential poll that extended mugabe 's rule . mugabe 's blame game mugabe has tried to make people believe that zimbabwe 's domestic problems are solely due to western sanctions and that once these are lifted the country will get back on its feet . however , while south african president jacob zuma said the sanctions were obstructing a successful power-sharing deal , he stressed during the summit with eu diplomats that zimbabwe 's problems were older than the sanctions . " i do n't think the sanctions started the problems in the economy .
i think it was the zimbabweans who undermined their own system .
that got the economy into trouble , " said zuma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zuma was unable to sway eu diplomats over the zimbabwe sanctions however , while eu and south african officials differed on the sanctions issue , they did agree on a joint communique in which they urged zimbabwe 's parties to " remove all obstacles " to the country 's power sharing deal and unity government . zimbabweans had hoped the power-sharing deal agreed to by prime minister morgan tsvangirai and president robert mugabe would pave the way for the country 's recovery under a unity government . the deal , which came into effect in february , managed to defuse the violence that ensued after last year 's disputed presidential election , but it has done little to actually change the country 's economic or humanitarian predicament .
power struggles over key posts in the government continue as do human rights abuses and food shortages . mugabe lashes out at west the 85-year-old mugabe reacted promptly to the eu 's announcement that sanctions would remain in place .
speaking at a gathering of his party 's youth wing in harare on friday , he slammed the sanctions and the west . " who said the british and americans should rule over others ? … we have not invited these bloody whites .
they want to poke their nose into our affairs .
refuse that , " mugabe said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's population depends heavily on foreign aid shipments mugabe also made clear on friday that he is still unwilling to back down on controversial land reforms which he implemented in the former british colony nine years ago . " the land reform exercise is irreversible , " mugabe said . mugabe 's government launched the land reforms in a bid to redress colonial grievances .
in the chaotic process that followed white farmers were often violently driven off their property and the land given to black farmers . since then these hitherto productive and efficient farms have often been badly run , which has contributed strongly to the fact that zimbabwe , once africa 's bread basket , is now struggling against food shortages , disease , poverty and hyperinflation . nk / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their appearance at the event was enough for the official chinese delegation to walk out . the two writers travelled to frankfurt though their invitations to the symposium had been revoked after criticism from beijing .
when bei ling and dai qing on saturday addressed the symposium , the official chinese delegation left the room in protest . the delegation returned only after an apology from juergen boos , organizer of the book fair .
mei zhaorong , former chinese ambassador to germany , said the german hosts had changed the program of the symposium without informing the delegation from beijing . " we did not come here for a lesson in democracy , " mei said .
" those times are over . " the two dissident authors in turn expressed their disappointment at the chinese reaction , saying that such behavior would undermine any constructive discussion . the symposium , entitled " china and the world - perception and reality , " was initially intended to clear up prejudices about the guest country - china - ahead of the 2009 frankfurt book fair , which begins in mid-october . the event had been intended as a promotional preamble but soon became a pr nightmare when china made it clear that if the organizers persisted in including dissident writers , it would pull out of the symposium altogether . the fair 's organizers bowed to chinese pressure and bei ling , dai qing and several other dissident authors found that their invitations had been revoked . dai qing 's last minute flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bei ling is planning to attend the book fair in october dai qing , considered to be one of china 's leading investigative journalists and environmental activists , managed to get a german visa as the guest of the german branch of the pen club of independent writers . when dai got to the airport , however , she found that her plane ticket had been mysteriously cancelled , despite the fact that she 'd twice phoned the travel company to confirm . " they tried so hard to keep me from frankfurt , " dai said ahead of the symposium . " when you hold an international symposium in frankfurt , it should be about giving chinese authors a voice when the central theme is chinese literature , " she added . " the authorities must give some clear arguments as to why i should n't be allowed to express my thoughts . " frankfurt book fair under fire the organizers of the world 's largest book fair have come under heavy criticism from writers and politicians alike .
however , the director of the frankfurt book fair defended the decision to revoke symposium invitations as a necessary compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boos said compromises are necessary china might have its way at the symposium , fair director juergen boos argued , but the annual book fair would be a different matter .
" content at the frankfurt book fair can not be supervised , " he said . this assurance is , however , unlikely to satisfy the author bei ling , who feels that the affair has seriously damaged the event 's credibility . bei was arrested in china in 2000 for " illegal publications " but was released shortly afterward following us intervention .
he had been planning to speak about censorship and self-censorship at the symposium . " i feel it is a shame if the frankfurt book fair can not say ' no ' or they can not control this , " bei told the dpa news agency .
" they decided this year for china to be the guest country , so they have to face all these complicated situations .
but some rules they can not turn back , like freedom of expression . " ai / kl / dpa / epd editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .
there , they picked up two russian icebreakers as escorts and headed to the dutch port of rotterdam . melting ice made journey possible the voyage , using the traditional route , is roughly 11,000 nautical miles -lrb- 12,658 miles -rrb- and passes through the suez canal .
by going over the top of the world , the freighters were able to cut 4,000 nautical miles from that trip .
the savings in fuel costs are substantial .
there is also an environmental benefit to be realized with a reduction in the amount of co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ships were accompanied by russian icebreakers in order to transit the northern sea , the company had to get permission from the rusian authorities .
when that permission came , the ships were escorted by the russian icebreaker " 50 years since victory . "
it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .
until now , the only vessels that had been traversing the passage were russian submarines and icebreakers. av / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

volkswagen 's factory in nanjing will roll out three new models , and its chengdu factory will begin producing two more .
output at those two facilities will double to between 300,000 and 350,000 units per year .
" china is one of volkswagen 's most important markets worldwide , " chief executive martin winterkorn said .
china is vw 's biggest growth market volkswagen already sells a wider range of products in china than any other carmaker , and has introduced three new models there this year .
it sold more cars in china than it did in germany during the month of july .
sales there grew 12.5 percent in 2008 , as they were falling 3.9 percent in western europe , 5.2 percent in north america , and 8.7 percent in japan .
" we expect to achieve double-digit growth in china this year and to secure our market leadership going forward , " volkswagen china chief winfried vahland said . he added that he expects the company to meet its goal of doubling annual unit sales to two million before its 2018 target date .
the wolfsburg-based company 's share price on the frankfurt stock exchange rose 4.35 percent in response to the investment news , closing at 127.83 euros -lrb- $ 186.55 -rrb- .
but volkswagen is far from the only game in town .
according to us analyst firm jd power , more than 90 chinese and foreign car brands operate in china , including toyota , ford and peugeot citroen .
only 20 people out of every 1,000 in china own a car , according to market researchers tns , compared to 700 per 1,000 in the united states. svs / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their appearance at the event was enough for the official chinese delegation to walk out . the two writers travelled to frankfurt though their invitations to the symposium had been revoked after criticism from beijing .

" those times are over .

but complaints of fraud , which have sparked concerns in the west , refuse to die down . in preliminary results announced saturday , afghan electoral authorities reported that incumbent president hamid karzai maintained his lead over his main rival abdullah abdullah with 54.3 percent of the vote .
abdullah , formerly afghanistan 's foreign minister , has 28.1 percent of the vote .
fifty percent of the total votes plus one will be needed to win the election and avoid a runoff .
a spokesman for afghanistan 's independent election commission , daud ali najafi , told news agency afp he was unsure when the full count of votes would be released .
" tommorrow we will sit down with the ecc -lsb- election complaints commission -rsb- and see when we can announce the final results , " najafi said .
the iec said the results included 95 percent of all votes cast , with votes from 92.8 percent of the polling stations counted .
about five percent of the total votes remain uncounted , and the remaining number have been quarantined while the election complaints commission investigates possible fraud .
of the 5.8 million valid votes , karzai had 3,009,559 . abdullah had 1,558,591 .
eu official slams " widespread fraud " allegations of ballot stuffing , voter intimidation , and other fraud have been rampant in the country 's election .
very low turnout could also affect the election 's legitimacy , with estimates that as few as 30 percent of the country 's eligible voters participated .
this week , german european union observer gunter mulack condemned " really widespread fraud " in the elections , citing implausibly high numbers of votes for a single candidate at some voting stations , and more ballots than likely voters at others .
the eu has cautioned candidates against declaring victory before the final results are released .
but observers representing the united states and united kingdom have expressed hope that a fair outcome can still be salvaged from the results .
the us special envoy to afghanistan , richard holbrooke has said that a do-over of the election is " not a viable option . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential contender abdullah abdullah has accused karzai of fraudulently engineering a win afghanistan 's electoral complaints commmission announced this week it had found " clear and convincing evidence of fraud " in 83 polling stations in three provinces , and invalidated all of the ballots collected there .
most of the questionable ballots came from areas known as strongholds for incumbent president hamid karzai , who hails from the southern province of kandahar .
the commission 's investigations in ghazni discovered unfolded ballots , missing material , and voter lists with ficticious card numbers - all indications of fraud. svs / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 12.09.2009 german commercial ships make historic arctic journey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the german ships , the beluga foresight navigates the icy waters two german commerical ships are sailing from asia to europe via russia 's arctic coast in a historic journey , navigating the once ice-blocked north east passage . for centuries , the idea of finding a way to sail cargo through the once impassable arctic has been a mariner 's dream .
that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .
there , they picked up two russian icebreakers as escorts and headed to the dutch port of rotterdam . melting ice made journey possible the voyage , using the traditional route , is roughly 11,000 nautical miles -lrb- 12,658 miles -rrb- and passes through the suez canal .
by going over the top of the world , the freighters were able to cut 4,000 nautical miles from that trip .
the savings in fuel costs are substantial .
there is also an environmental benefit to be realized with a reduction in the amount of co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ships were accompanied by russian icebreakers in order to transit the northern sea , the company had to get permission from the rusian authorities .
when that permission came , the ships were escorted by the russian icebreaker " 50 years since victory . "
it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .
until now , the only vessels that had been traversing the passage were russian submarines and icebreakers. av / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their appearance at the event was enough for the official chinese delegation to walk out . the two writers travelled to frankfurt though their invitations to the symposium had been revoked after criticism from beijing .
when bei ling and dai qing on saturday addressed the symposium , the official chinese delegation left the room in protest . the delegation returned only after an apology from juergen boos , organizer of the book fair .
mei zhaorong , former chinese ambassador to germany , said the german hosts had changed the program of the symposium without informing the delegation from beijing . " we did not come here for a lesson in democracy , " mei said .
" those times are over . " the two dissident authors in turn expressed their disappointment at the chinese reaction , saying that such behavior would undermine any constructive discussion . the symposium , entitled " china and the world - perception and reality , " was initially intended to clear up prejudices about the guest country - china - ahead of the 2009 frankfurt book fair , which begins in mid-october . the event had been intended as a promotional preamble but soon became a pr nightmare when china made it clear that if the organizers persisted in including dissident writers , it would pull out of the symposium altogether . the fair 's organizers bowed to chinese pressure and bei ling , dai qing and several other dissident authors found that their invitations had been revoked . dai qing 's last minute flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bei ling is planning to attend the book fair in october dai qing , considered to be one of china 's leading investigative journalists and environmental activists , managed to get a german visa as the guest of the german branch of the pen club of independent writers . when dai got to the airport , however , she found that her plane ticket had been mysteriously cancelled , despite the fact that she 'd twice phoned the travel company to confirm . " they tried so hard to keep me from frankfurt , " dai said ahead of the symposium . " when you hold an international symposium in frankfurt , it should be about giving chinese authors a voice when the central theme is chinese literature , " she added . " the authorities must give some clear arguments as to why i should n't be allowed to express my thoughts . " frankfurt book fair under fire the organizers of the world 's largest book fair have come under heavy criticism from writers and politicians alike .
however , the director of the frankfurt book fair defended the decision to revoke symposium invitations as a necessary compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boos said compromises are necessary china might have its way at the symposium , fair director juergen boos argued , but the annual book fair would be a different matter .
" content at the frankfurt book fair can not be supervised , " he said . this assurance is , however , unlikely to satisfy the author bei ling , who feels that the affair has seriously damaged the event 's credibility . bei was arrested in china in 2000 for " illegal publications " but was released shortly afterward following us intervention .
he had been planning to speak about censorship and self-censorship at the symposium . " i feel it is a shame if the frankfurt book fair can not say ' no ' or they can not control this , " bei told the dpa news agency .
" they decided this year for china to be the guest country , so they have to face all these complicated situations .
but some rules they can not turn back , like freedom of expression . " ai / kl / dpa / epd editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but complaints of fraud , which have sparked concerns in the west , refuse to die down . in preliminary results announced saturday , afghan electoral authorities reported that incumbent president hamid karzai maintained his lead over his main rival abdullah abdullah with 54.3 percent of the vote .
abdullah , formerly afghanistan 's foreign minister , has 28.1 percent of the vote .
fifty percent of the total votes plus one will be needed to win the election and avoid a runoff .
a spokesman for afghanistan 's independent election commission , daud ali najafi , told news agency afp he was unsure when the full count of votes would be released .
" tommorrow we will sit down with the ecc -lsb- election complaints commission -rsb- and see when we can announce the final results , " najafi said .
the iec said the results included 95 percent of all votes cast , with votes from 92.8 percent of the polling stations counted .
about five percent of the total votes remain uncounted , and the remaining number have been quarantined while the election complaints commission investigates possible fraud .
of the 5.8 million valid votes , karzai had 3,009,559 . abdullah had 1,558,591 .

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .
there , they picked up two russian icebreakers as escorts and headed to the dutch port of rotterdam . melting ice made journey possible the voyage , using the traditional route , is roughly 11,000 nautical miles -lrb- 12,658 miles -rrb- and passes through the suez canal .
by going over the top of the world , the freighters were able to cut 4,000 nautical miles from that trip .
the savings in fuel costs are substantial .
there is also an environmental benefit to be realized with a reduction in the amount of co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ships were accompanied by russian icebreakers in order to transit the northern sea , the company had to get permission from the rusian authorities .
when that permission came , the ships were escorted by the russian icebreaker " 50 years since victory . "
it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .
until now , the only vessels that had been traversing the passage were russian submarines and icebreakers. av / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

volkswagen 's factory in nanjing will roll out three new models , and its chengdu factory will begin producing two more .
output at those two facilities will double to between 300,000 and 350,000 units per year .
" china is one of volkswagen 's most important markets worldwide , " chief executive martin winterkorn said .
china is vw 's biggest growth market volkswagen already sells a wider range of products in china than any other carmaker , and has introduced three new models there this year .
it sold more cars in china than it did in germany during the month of july .
sales there grew 12.5 percent in 2008 , as they were falling 3.9 percent in western europe , 5.2 percent in north america , and 8.7 percent in japan .
" we expect to achieve double-digit growth in china this year and to secure our market leadership going forward , " volkswagen china chief winfried vahland said . he added that he expects the company to meet its goal of doubling annual unit sales to two million before its 2018 target date .
the wolfsburg-based company 's share price on the frankfurt stock exchange rose 4.35 percent in response to the investment news , closing at 127.83 euros -lrb- $ 186.55 -rrb- .
but volkswagen is far from the only game in town .
according to us analyst firm jd power , more than 90 chinese and foreign car brands operate in china , including toyota , ford and peugeot citroen .
only 20 people out of every 1,000 in china own a car , according to market researchers tns , compared to 700 per 1,000 in the united states. svs / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

volkswagen 's factory in nanjing will roll out three new models , and its chengdu factory will begin producing two more .
output at those two facilities will double to between 300,000 and 350,000 units per year .
" china is one of volkswagen 's most important markets worldwide , " chief executive martin winterkorn said .
china is vw 's biggest growth market volkswagen already sells a wider range of products in china than any other carmaker , and has introduced three new models there this year .
it sold more cars in china than it did in germany during the month of july .
sales there grew 12.5 percent in 2008 , as they were falling 3.9 percent in western europe , 5.2 percent in north america , and 8.7 percent in japan .
" we expect to achieve double-digit growth in china this year and to secure our market leadership going forward , " volkswagen china chief winfried vahland said . he added that he expects the company to meet its goal of doubling annual unit sales to two million before its 2018 target date .
the wolfsburg-based company 's share price on the frankfurt stock exchange rose 4.35 percent in response to the investment news , closing at 127.83 euros -lrb- $ 186.55 -rrb- .
but volkswagen is far from the only game in town .
according to us analyst firm jd power , more than 90 chinese and foreign car brands operate in china , including toyota , ford and peugeot citroen .
only 20 people out of every 1,000 in china own a car , according to market researchers tns , compared to 700 per 1,000 in the united states. svs / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their appearance at the event was enough for the official chinese delegation to walk out . the two writers travelled to frankfurt though their invitations to the symposium had been revoked after criticism from beijing .
when bei ling and dai qing on saturday addressed the symposium , the official chinese delegation left the room in protest . the delegation returned only after an apology from juergen boos , organizer of the book fair .
mei zhaorong , former chinese ambassador to germany , said the german hosts had changed the program of the symposium without informing the delegation from beijing . " we did not come here for a lesson in democracy , " mei said .
" those times are over . " the two dissident authors in turn expressed their disappointment at the chinese reaction , saying that such behavior would undermine any constructive discussion . the symposium , entitled " china and the world - perception and reality , " was initially intended to clear up prejudices about the guest country - china - ahead of the 2009 frankfurt book fair , which begins in mid-october . the event had been intended as a promotional preamble but soon became a pr nightmare when china made it clear that if the organizers persisted in including dissident writers , it would pull out of the symposium altogether . the fair 's organizers bowed to chinese pressure and bei ling , dai qing and several other dissident authors found that their invitations had been revoked . dai qing 's last minute flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bei ling is planning to attend the book fair in october dai qing , considered to be one of china 's leading investigative journalists and environmental activists , managed to get a german visa as the guest of the german branch of the pen club of independent writers . when dai got to the airport , however , she found that her plane ticket had been mysteriously cancelled , despite the fact that she 'd twice phoned the travel company to confirm . " they tried so hard to keep me from frankfurt , " dai said ahead of the symposium . " when you hold an international symposium in frankfurt , it should be about giving chinese authors a voice when the central theme is chinese literature , " she added . " the authorities must give some clear arguments as to why i should n't be allowed to express my thoughts . " frankfurt book fair under fire the organizers of the world 's largest book fair have come under heavy criticism from writers and politicians alike .
however , the director of the frankfurt book fair defended the decision to revoke symposium invitations as a necessary compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boos said compromises are necessary china might have its way at the symposium , fair director juergen boos argued , but the annual book fair would be a different matter .
" content at the frankfurt book fair can not be supervised , " he said . this assurance is , however , unlikely to satisfy the author bei ling , who feels that the affair has seriously damaged the event 's credibility . bei was arrested in china in 2000 for " illegal publications " but was released shortly afterward following us intervention .
he had been planning to speak about censorship and self-censorship at the symposium . " i feel it is a shame if the frankfurt book fair can not say ' no ' or they can not control this , " bei told the dpa news agency .
" they decided this year for china to be the guest country , so they have to face all these complicated situations .
but some rules they can not turn back , like freedom of expression . " ai / kl / dpa / epd editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we welcome you with open arms .
we hope our talks will be fruitful with a positive outcome , " mugabe said in the capital harare on saturday .
the eu delegation led by karel de gucht , eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , and the swedish eu presidency was also to hold talks with mugabe 's long-time political rival , morgan tsvangirai . the visit is the first since the eu began targeted sanctions in 2002 against members of mugabe 's government for human rights violations .
it marks a thawing in ties between western powers and zimbabwe .
eu officials have described the visit as an attempt to reopen political dialogue with the country . " this is a critical time for zimbabwe and the weight of responsibility falls squarely on the country 's leaders to deliver urgent political , economic and social progress for the benefit of all people of zimbabwe , " de gucht said in a statement ahead of the visit . zimbabwe says it needs $ 10 billion in foreign reconstruction aid .
but western nations are willing to commit further aid without further political and economic reforms as part of a power-sharing deal called the global political agreement -lrb- gpa -rrb- . eu reaffirms sanctions policy a day before the visit , eu officials were forced to defend the bloc 's decision of sticking to sanctions against mugabe and his inner circle . " we are not talking about economic sanctions , " karel de gucht said at the second eu-south africa summit in cape town on friday . de gucht said that the sanctions imposed in 2002 targeted individuals and that they had no impact on the general population . he was responding to calls made at a summit of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- leaders earlier this week .
african leaders meeting in kinshasa had demanded that the zimbabwe sanctions be lifted , arguing that they were obstructing the country 's economic recovery . the eu and the us have said they will not lift sanctions until zimbabwe implements further reforms , especially in the field of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says zimbabweans are suffering because of homegrown mismanagement swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , pointed out that human rights abuses continued in zimbabwe , including violence directed at supporters of prime minister morgan tsvangirai . " it is not the restrictions that are creating the problems in zimbabwe , it is the mismanagement … not respecting human rights , " said reinfeldt in the south african town of kleinmond , where the summit was taking place . the eu and us implemented the targeted sanctions in 2002 following a disputed presidential poll that extended mugabe 's rule . mugabe 's blame game mugabe has tried to make people believe that zimbabwe 's domestic problems are solely due to western sanctions and that once these are lifted the country will get back on its feet . however , while south african president jacob zuma said the sanctions were obstructing a successful power-sharing deal , he stressed during the summit with eu diplomats that zimbabwe 's problems were older than the sanctions . " i do n't think the sanctions started the problems in the economy .
i think it was the zimbabweans who undermined their own system .
that got the economy into trouble , " said zuma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zuma was unable to sway eu diplomats over the zimbabwe sanctions however , while eu and south african officials differed on the sanctions issue , they did agree on a joint communique in which they urged zimbabwe 's parties to " remove all obstacles " to the country 's power sharing deal and unity government . zimbabweans had hoped the power-sharing deal agreed to by prime minister morgan tsvangirai and president robert mugabe would pave the way for the country 's recovery under a unity government . the deal , which came into effect in february , managed to defuse the violence that ensued after last year 's disputed presidential election , but it has done little to actually change the country 's economic or humanitarian predicament .
power struggles over key posts in the government continue as do human rights abuses and food shortages . mugabe lashes out at west the 85-year-old mugabe reacted promptly to the eu 's announcement that sanctions would remain in place .
speaking at a gathering of his party 's youth wing in harare on friday , he slammed the sanctions and the west . " who said the british and americans should rule over others ? … we have not invited these bloody whites .
they want to poke their nose into our affairs .
refuse that , " mugabe said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's population depends heavily on foreign aid shipments mugabe also made clear on friday that he is still unwilling to back down on controversial land reforms which he implemented in the former british colony nine years ago .

“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .
there , they picked up two russian icebreakers as escorts and headed to the dutch port of rotterdam . melting ice made journey possible the voyage , using the traditional route , is roughly 11,000 nautical miles -lrb- 12,658 miles -rrb- and passes through the suez canal .
by going over the top of the world , the freighters were able to cut 4,000 nautical miles from that trip .
the savings in fuel costs are substantial .
there is also an environmental benefit to be realized with a reduction in the amount of co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ships were accompanied by russian icebreakers in order to transit the northern sea , the company had to get permission from the rusian authorities .
when that permission came , the ships were escorted by the russian icebreaker " 50 years since victory . "
it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .
until now , the only vessels that had been traversing the passage were russian submarines and icebreakers. av / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

volkswagen 's factory in nanjing will roll out three new models , and its chengdu factory will begin producing two more .
output at those two facilities will double to between 300,000 and 350,000 units per year .
" china is one of volkswagen 's most important markets worldwide , " chief executive martin winterkorn said .
china is vw 's biggest growth market volkswagen already sells a wider range of products in china than any other carmaker , and has introduced three new models there this year .
it sold more cars in china than it did in germany during the month of july .
sales there grew 12.5 percent in 2008 , as they were falling 3.9 percent in western europe , 5.2 percent in north america , and 8.7 percent in japan .
" we expect to achieve double-digit growth in china this year and to secure our market leadership going forward , " volkswagen china chief winfried vahland said . he added that he expects the company to meet its goal of doubling annual unit sales to two million before its 2018 target date .
the wolfsburg-based company 's share price on the frankfurt stock exchange rose 4.35 percent in response to the investment news , closing at 127.83 euros -lrb- $ 186.55 -rrb- .
but volkswagen is far from the only game in town .
according to us analyst firm jd power , more than 90 chinese and foreign car brands operate in china , including toyota , ford and peugeot citroen .
only 20 people out of every 1,000 in china own a car , according to market researchers tns , compared to 700 per 1,000 in the united states. svs / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the iec said the results included 95 percent of all votes cast , with votes from 92.8 percent of the polling stations counted .
about five percent of the total votes remain uncounted , and the remaining number have been quarantined while the election complaints commission investigates possible fraud .
of the 5.8 million valid votes , karzai had 3,009,559 . abdullah had 1,558,591 .
eu official slams " widespread fraud " allegations of ballot stuffing , voter intimidation , and other fraud have been rampant in the country 's election .
very low turnout could also affect the election 's legitimacy , with estimates that as few as 30 percent of the country 's eligible voters participated .
this week , german european union observer gunter mulack condemned " really widespread fraud " in the elections , citing implausibly high numbers of votes for a single candidate at some voting stations , and more ballots than likely voters at others .
the eu has cautioned candidates against declaring victory before the final results are released .
but observers representing the united states and united kingdom have expressed hope that a fair outcome can still be salvaged from the results .
the us special envoy to afghanistan , richard holbrooke has said that a do-over of the election is " not a viable option . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential contender abdullah abdullah has accused karzai of fraudulently engineering a win afghanistan 's electoral complaints commmission announced this week it had found " clear and convincing evidence of fraud " in 83 polling stations in three provinces , and invalidated all of the ballots collected there .
most of the questionable ballots came from areas known as strongholds for incumbent president hamid karzai , who hails from the southern province of kandahar .
the commission 's investigations in ghazni discovered unfolded ballots , missing material , and voter lists with ficticious card numbers - all indications of fraud. svs / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their appearance at the event was enough for the official chinese delegation to walk out . the two writers travelled to frankfurt though their invitations to the symposium had been revoked after criticism from beijing .
when bei ling and dai qing on saturday addressed the symposium , the official chinese delegation left the room in protest . the delegation returned only after an apology from juergen boos , organizer of the book fair .
mei zhaorong , former chinese ambassador to germany , said the german hosts had changed the program of the symposium without informing the delegation from beijing . " we did not come here for a lesson in democracy , " mei said .
" those times are over . " the two dissident authors in turn expressed their disappointment at the chinese reaction , saying that such behavior would undermine any constructive discussion . the symposium , entitled " china and the world - perception and reality , " was initially intended to clear up prejudices about the guest country - china - ahead of the 2009 frankfurt book fair , which begins in mid-october . the event had been intended as a promotional preamble but soon became a pr nightmare when china made it clear that if the organizers persisted in including dissident writers , it would pull out of the symposium altogether . the fair 's organizers bowed to chinese pressure and bei ling , dai qing and several other dissident authors found that their invitations had been revoked . dai qing 's last minute flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bei ling is planning to attend the book fair in october dai qing , considered to be one of china 's leading investigative journalists and environmental activists , managed to get a german visa as the guest of the german branch of the pen club of independent writers . when dai got to the airport , however , she found that her plane ticket had been mysteriously cancelled , despite the fact that she 'd twice phoned the travel company to confirm . " they tried so hard to keep me from frankfurt , " dai said ahead of the symposium . " when you hold an international symposium in frankfurt , it should be about giving chinese authors a voice when the central theme is chinese literature , " she added . " the authorities must give some clear arguments as to why i should n't be allowed to express my thoughts . " frankfurt book fair under fire the organizers of the world 's largest book fair have come under heavy criticism from writers and politicians alike .
however , the director of the frankfurt book fair defended the decision to revoke symposium invitations as a necessary compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boos said compromises are necessary china might have its way at the symposium , fair director juergen boos argued , but the annual book fair would be a different matter .
" content at the frankfurt book fair can not be supervised , " he said . this assurance is , however , unlikely to satisfy the author bei ling , who feels that the affair has seriously damaged the event 's credibility . bei was arrested in china in 2000 for " illegal publications " but was released shortly afterward following us intervention .
he had been planning to speak about censorship and self-censorship at the symposium . " i feel it is a shame if the frankfurt book fair can not say ' no ' or they can not control this , " bei told the dpa news agency .
" they decided this year for china to be the guest country , so they have to face all these complicated situations .
but some rules they can not turn back , like freedom of expression . " ai / kl / dpa / epd editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .

christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?
who will ask the questions ?
will the candidates be allowed to address each other ?
all of these issues , and dozens more , must be negotiated between the political parties and the debate 's sponsor .
german debate formats slow to innovate the original american debate format consisted of a panel of journalists posing consecutive questions to kennedy and nixon .
all presidential debates in the us between 1960 and 1988 employed this format , which germany 's debaters continue to use today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate between stoiber , left , and schröder was the first one-on-one duel , since then there 's been little change to the format german debate formats have been remarkably slow to innovate , the key exception being the structural change in 2002 that resulted in a one-on-one duel between schroder and stoiber .
the 2009 debates continue the tradition without significant changes , such as multimedia enhancements , mail-in questions or an interface for video-questions pre-produced by viewers at home .
the joint venture of public networks ard and zdf with private networks rtl and pro7.sat1 brings together four anchorpersons , each representing their own media network - and stealing time from the debate between the candidates .
the debate will be broadcast live by the participating television stations , but there ´ s no online coverage : the networks agreed not to offer live-streaming and will only put up an online video after the debate has finished .
other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .
no matter the format and no matter the country , campaign debates have shown themselves to be of great value to voters , imparting information about politicians and their positions in an audience-friendly way .
the challenge in germany and throughout the world is to ensure that debates are responsive to the needs of citizens first , and second to the needs of political candidates and the media .
after nearly 50 years of on-camera debates , this remains the key struggle .

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .

debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .
there , they picked up two russian icebreakers as escorts and headed to the dutch port of rotterdam . melting ice made journey possible the voyage , using the traditional route , is roughly 11,000 nautical miles -lrb- 12,658 miles -rrb- and passes through the suez canal .
by going over the top of the world , the freighters were able to cut 4,000 nautical miles from that trip .
the savings in fuel costs are substantial .
there is also an environmental benefit to be realized with a reduction in the amount of co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ships were accompanied by russian icebreakers in order to transit the northern sea , the company had to get permission from the rusian authorities .
when that permission came , the ships were escorted by the russian icebreaker " 50 years since victory . "
it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .
until now , the only vessels that had been traversing the passage were russian submarines and icebreakers. av / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?
who will ask the questions ?
will the candidates be allowed to address each other ?
all of these issues , and dozens more , must be negotiated between the political parties and the debate 's sponsor .
german debate formats slow to innovate the original american debate format consisted of a panel of journalists posing consecutive questions to kennedy and nixon .
all presidential debates in the us between 1960 and 1988 employed this format , which germany 's debaters continue to use today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate between stoiber , left , and schröder was the first one-on-one duel , since then there 's been little change to the format german debate formats have been remarkably slow to innovate , the key exception being the structural change in 2002 that resulted in a one-on-one duel between schroder and stoiber .
the 2009 debates continue the tradition without significant changes , such as multimedia enhancements , mail-in questions or an interface for video-questions pre-produced by viewers at home .
the joint venture of public networks ard and zdf with private networks rtl and pro7.sat1 brings together four anchorpersons , each representing their own media network - and stealing time from the debate between the candidates .
the debate will be broadcast live by the participating television stations , but there ´ s no online coverage : the networks agreed not to offer live-streaming and will only put up an online video after the debate has finished .
other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .
no matter the format and no matter the country , campaign debates have shown themselves to be of great value to voters , imparting information about politicians and their positions in an audience-friendly way .
the challenge in germany and throughout the world is to ensure that debates are responsive to the needs of citizens first , and second to the needs of political candidates and the media .
after nearly 50 years of on-camera debates , this remains the key struggle .

in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .

other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .
no matter the format and no matter the country , campaign debates have shown themselves to be of great value to voters , imparting information about politicians and their positions in an audience-friendly way .
the challenge in germany and throughout the world is to ensure that debates are responsive to the needs of citizens first , and second to the needs of political candidates and the media .
after nearly 50 years of on-camera debates , this remains the key struggle .

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .
there , they picked up two russian icebreakers as escorts and headed to the dutch port of rotterdam . melting ice made journey possible the voyage , using the traditional route , is roughly 11,000 nautical miles -lrb- 12,658 miles -rrb- and passes through the suez canal .
by going over the top of the world , the freighters were able to cut 4,000 nautical miles from that trip .
the savings in fuel costs are substantial .
there is also an environmental benefit to be realized with a reduction in the amount of co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ships were accompanied by russian icebreakers in order to transit the northern sea , the company had to get permission from the rusian authorities .
when that permission came , the ships were escorted by the russian icebreaker " 50 years since victory . "
it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .

over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?
who will ask the questions ?
will the candidates be allowed to address each other ?
all of these issues , and dozens more , must be negotiated between the political parties and the debate 's sponsor .
german debate formats slow to innovate the original american debate format consisted of a panel of journalists posing consecutive questions to kennedy and nixon .
all presidential debates in the us between 1960 and 1988 employed this format , which germany 's debaters continue to use today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate between stoiber , left , and schröder was the first one-on-one duel , since then there 's been little change to the format german debate formats have been remarkably slow to innovate , the key exception being the structural change in 2002 that resulted in a one-on-one duel between schroder and stoiber .
the 2009 debates continue the tradition without significant changes , such as multimedia enhancements , mail-in questions or an interface for video-questions pre-produced by viewers at home .
the joint venture of public networks ard and zdf with private networks rtl and pro7.sat1 brings together four anchorpersons , each representing their own media network - and stealing time from the debate between the candidates .
the debate will be broadcast live by the participating television stations , but there ´ s no online coverage : the networks agreed not to offer live-streaming and will only put up an online video after the debate has finished .
other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .
no matter the format and no matter the country , campaign debates have shown themselves to be of great value to voters , imparting information about politicians and their positions in an audience-friendly way .
the challenge in germany and throughout the world is to ensure that debates are responsive to the needs of citizens first , and second to the needs of political candidates and the media .
after nearly 50 years of on-camera debates , this remains the key struggle .

" we welcome you with open arms .
we hope our talks will be fruitful with a positive outcome , " mugabe said in the capital harare on saturday .
the eu delegation led by karel de gucht , eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , and the swedish eu presidency was also to hold talks with mugabe 's long-time political rival , morgan tsvangirai . the visit is the first since the eu began targeted sanctions in 2002 against members of mugabe 's government for human rights violations .
it marks a thawing in ties between western powers and zimbabwe .
eu officials have described the visit as an attempt to reopen political dialogue with the country . " this is a critical time for zimbabwe and the weight of responsibility falls squarely on the country 's leaders to deliver urgent political , economic and social progress for the benefit of all people of zimbabwe , " de gucht said in a statement ahead of the visit . zimbabwe says it needs $ 10 billion in foreign reconstruction aid .
but western nations are willing to commit further aid without further political and economic reforms as part of a power-sharing deal called the global political agreement -lrb- gpa -rrb- . eu reaffirms sanctions policy a day before the visit , eu officials were forced to defend the bloc 's decision of sticking to sanctions against mugabe and his inner circle . " we are not talking about economic sanctions , " karel de gucht said at the second eu-south africa summit in cape town on friday . de gucht said that the sanctions imposed in 2002 targeted individuals and that they had no impact on the general population . he was responding to calls made at a summit of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- leaders earlier this week .
african leaders meeting in kinshasa had demanded that the zimbabwe sanctions be lifted , arguing that they were obstructing the country 's economic recovery . the eu and the us have said they will not lift sanctions until zimbabwe implements further reforms , especially in the field of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says zimbabweans are suffering because of homegrown mismanagement swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , pointed out that human rights abuses continued in zimbabwe , including violence directed at supporters of prime minister morgan tsvangirai . " it is not the restrictions that are creating the problems in zimbabwe , it is the mismanagement … not respecting human rights , " said reinfeldt in the south african town of kleinmond , where the summit was taking place . the eu and us implemented the targeted sanctions in 2002 following a disputed presidential poll that extended mugabe 's rule . mugabe 's blame game mugabe has tried to make people believe that zimbabwe 's domestic problems are solely due to western sanctions and that once these are lifted the country will get back on its feet . however , while south african president jacob zuma said the sanctions were obstructing a successful power-sharing deal , he stressed during the summit with eu diplomats that zimbabwe 's problems were older than the sanctions . " i do n't think the sanctions started the problems in the economy .
i think it was the zimbabweans who undermined their own system .
that got the economy into trouble , " said zuma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zuma was unable to sway eu diplomats over the zimbabwe sanctions however , while eu and south african officials differed on the sanctions issue , they did agree on a joint communique in which they urged zimbabwe 's parties to " remove all obstacles " to the country 's power sharing deal and unity government . zimbabweans had hoped the power-sharing deal agreed to by prime minister morgan tsvangirai and president robert mugabe would pave the way for the country 's recovery under a unity government . the deal , which came into effect in february , managed to defuse the violence that ensued after last year 's disputed presidential election , but it has done little to actually change the country 's economic or humanitarian predicament .
power struggles over key posts in the government continue as do human rights abuses and food shortages . mugabe lashes out at west the 85-year-old mugabe reacted promptly to the eu 's announcement that sanctions would remain in place .
speaking at a gathering of his party 's youth wing in harare on friday , he slammed the sanctions and the west . " who said the british and americans should rule over others ? … we have not invited these bloody whites .
they want to poke their nose into our affairs .
refuse that , " mugabe said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's population depends heavily on foreign aid shipments mugabe also made clear on friday that he is still unwilling to back down on controversial land reforms which he implemented in the former british colony nine years ago . " the land reform exercise is irreversible , " mugabe said . mugabe 's government launched the land reforms in a bid to redress colonial grievances .
in the chaotic process that followed white farmers were often violently driven off their property and the land given to black farmers . since then these hitherto productive and efficient farms have often been badly run , which has contributed strongly to the fact that zimbabwe , once africa 's bread basket , is now struggling against food shortages , disease , poverty and hyperinflation . nk / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when bei ling and dai qing on saturday addressed the symposium , the official chinese delegation left the room in protest . the delegation returned only after an apology from juergen boos , organizer of the book fair .
mei zhaorong , former chinese ambassador to germany , said the german hosts had changed the program of the symposium without informing the delegation from beijing . " we did not come here for a lesson in democracy , " mei said .
" those times are over . " the two dissident authors in turn expressed their disappointment at the chinese reaction , saying that such behavior would undermine any constructive discussion . the symposium , entitled " china and the world - perception and reality , " was initially intended to clear up prejudices about the guest country - china - ahead of the 2009 frankfurt book fair , which begins in mid-october . the event had been intended as a promotional preamble but soon became a pr nightmare when china made it clear that if the organizers persisted in including dissident writers , it would pull out of the symposium altogether . the fair 's organizers bowed to chinese pressure and bei ling , dai qing and several other dissident authors found that their invitations had been revoked . dai qing 's last minute flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bei ling is planning to attend the book fair in october dai qing , considered to be one of china 's leading investigative journalists and environmental activists , managed to get a german visa as the guest of the german branch of the pen club of independent writers . when dai got to the airport , however , she found that her plane ticket had been mysteriously cancelled , despite the fact that she 'd twice phoned the travel company to confirm . " they tried so hard to keep me from frankfurt , " dai said ahead of the symposium . " when you hold an international symposium in frankfurt , it should be about giving chinese authors a voice when the central theme is chinese literature , " she added . " the authorities must give some clear arguments as to why i should n't be allowed to express my thoughts . " frankfurt book fair under fire the organizers of the world 's largest book fair have come under heavy criticism from writers and politicians alike .
however , the director of the frankfurt book fair defended the decision to revoke symposium invitations as a necessary compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boos said compromises are necessary china might have its way at the symposium , fair director juergen boos argued , but the annual book fair would be a different matter .
" content at the frankfurt book fair can not be supervised , " he said . this assurance is , however , unlikely to satisfy the author bei ling , who feels that the affair has seriously damaged the event 's credibility . bei was arrested in china in 2000 for " illegal publications " but was released shortly afterward following us intervention .
he had been planning to speak about censorship and self-censorship at the symposium . " i feel it is a shame if the frankfurt book fair can not say ' no ' or they can not control this , " bei told the dpa news agency .
" they decided this year for china to be the guest country , so they have to face all these complicated situations .
but some rules they can not turn back , like freedom of expression . " ai / kl / dpa / epd editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .

it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .
there , they picked up two russian icebreakers as escorts and headed to the dutch port of rotterdam . melting ice made journey possible the voyage , using the traditional route , is roughly 11,000 nautical miles -lrb- 12,658 miles -rrb- and passes through the suez canal .
by going over the top of the world , the freighters were able to cut 4,000 nautical miles from that trip .
the savings in fuel costs are substantial .
there is also an environmental benefit to be realized with a reduction in the amount of co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ships were accompanied by russian icebreakers in order to transit the northern sea , the company had to get permission from the rusian authorities .
when that permission came , the ships were escorted by the russian icebreaker " 50 years since victory . "
it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .
until now , the only vessels that had been traversing the passage were russian submarines and icebreakers. av / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but complaints of fraud , which have sparked concerns in the west , refuse to die down . in preliminary results announced saturday , afghan electoral authorities reported that incumbent president hamid karzai maintained his lead over his main rival abdullah abdullah with 54.3 percent of the vote .
abdullah , formerly afghanistan 's foreign minister , has 28.1 percent of the vote .
fifty percent of the total votes plus one will be needed to win the election and avoid a runoff .
a spokesman for afghanistan 's independent election commission , daud ali najafi , told news agency afp he was unsure when the full count of votes would be released .
" tommorrow we will sit down with the ecc -lsb- election complaints commission -rsb- and see when we can announce the final results , " najafi said .
the iec said the results included 95 percent of all votes cast , with votes from 92.8 percent of the polling stations counted .
about five percent of the total votes remain uncounted , and the remaining number have been quarantined while the election complaints commission investigates possible fraud .
of the 5.8 million valid votes , karzai had 3,009,559 . abdullah had 1,558,591 .
eu official slams " widespread fraud " allegations of ballot stuffing , voter intimidation , and other fraud have been rampant in the country 's election .
very low turnout could also affect the election 's legitimacy , with estimates that as few as 30 percent of the country 's eligible voters participated .
this week , german european union observer gunter mulack condemned " really widespread fraud " in the elections , citing implausibly high numbers of votes for a single candidate at some voting stations , and more ballots than likely voters at others .
the eu has cautioned candidates against declaring victory before the final results are released .
but observers representing the united states and united kingdom have expressed hope that a fair outcome can still be salvaged from the results .
the us special envoy to afghanistan , richard holbrooke has said that a do-over of the election is " not a viable option . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential contender abdullah abdullah has accused karzai of fraudulently engineering a win afghanistan 's electoral complaints commmission announced this week it had found " clear and convincing evidence of fraud " in 83 polling stations in three provinces , and invalidated all of the ballots collected there .
most of the questionable ballots came from areas known as strongholds for incumbent president hamid karzai , who hails from the southern province of kandahar .
the commission 's investigations in ghazni discovered unfolded ballots , missing material , and voter lists with ficticious card numbers - all indications of fraud. svs / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their appearance at the event was enough for the official chinese delegation to walk out . the two writers travelled to frankfurt though their invitations to the symposium had been revoked after criticism from beijing .
when bei ling and dai qing on saturday addressed the symposium , the official chinese delegation left the room in protest . the delegation returned only after an apology from juergen boos , organizer of the book fair .
mei zhaorong , former chinese ambassador to germany , said the german hosts had changed the program of the symposium without informing the delegation from beijing . " we did not come here for a lesson in democracy , " mei said .
" those times are over . " the two dissident authors in turn expressed their disappointment at the chinese reaction , saying that such behavior would undermine any constructive discussion . the symposium , entitled " china and the world - perception and reality , " was initially intended to clear up prejudices about the guest country - china - ahead of the 2009 frankfurt book fair , which begins in mid-october . the event had been intended as a promotional preamble but soon became a pr nightmare when china made it clear that if the organizers persisted in including dissident writers , it would pull out of the symposium altogether . the fair 's organizers bowed to chinese pressure and bei ling , dai qing and several other dissident authors found that their invitations had been revoked . dai qing 's last minute flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bei ling is planning to attend the book fair in october dai qing , considered to be one of china 's leading investigative journalists and environmental activists , managed to get a german visa as the guest of the german branch of the pen club of independent writers . when dai got to the airport , however , she found that her plane ticket had been mysteriously cancelled , despite the fact that she 'd twice phoned the travel company to confirm . " they tried so hard to keep me from frankfurt , " dai said ahead of the symposium . " when you hold an international symposium in frankfurt , it should be about giving chinese authors a voice when the central theme is chinese literature , " she added . " the authorities must give some clear arguments as to why i should n't be allowed to express my thoughts . " frankfurt book fair under fire the organizers of the world 's largest book fair have come under heavy criticism from writers and politicians alike .
however , the director of the frankfurt book fair defended the decision to revoke symposium invitations as a necessary compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boos said compromises are necessary china might have its way at the symposium , fair director juergen boos argued , but the annual book fair would be a different matter .
" content at the frankfurt book fair can not be supervised , " he said . this assurance is , however , unlikely to satisfy the author bei ling , who feels that the affair has seriously damaged the event 's credibility . bei was arrested in china in 2000 for " illegal publications " but was released shortly afterward following us intervention .
he had been planning to speak about censorship and self-censorship at the symposium . " i feel it is a shame if the frankfurt book fair can not say ' no ' or they can not control this , " bei told the dpa news agency .
" they decided this year for china to be the guest country , so they have to face all these complicated situations .
but some rules they can not turn back , like freedom of expression . " ai / kl / dpa / epd editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

volkswagen 's factory in nanjing will roll out three new models , and its chengdu factory will begin producing two more .
output at those two facilities will double to between 300,000 and 350,000 units per year .
" china is one of volkswagen 's most important markets worldwide , " chief executive martin winterkorn said .
china is vw 's biggest growth market volkswagen already sells a wider range of products in china than any other carmaker , and has introduced three new models there this year .
it sold more cars in china than it did in germany during the month of july .
sales there grew 12.5 percent in 2008 , as they were falling 3.9 percent in western europe , 5.2 percent in north america , and 8.7 percent in japan .
" we expect to achieve double-digit growth in china this year and to secure our market leadership going forward , " volkswagen china chief winfried vahland said . he added that he expects the company to meet its goal of doubling annual unit sales to two million before its 2018 target date .
the wolfsburg-based company 's share price on the frankfurt stock exchange rose 4.35 percent in response to the investment news , closing at 127.83 euros -lrb- $ 186.55 -rrb- .

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .

by going over the top of the world , the freighters were able to cut 4,000 nautical miles from that trip .
the savings in fuel costs are substantial .
there is also an environmental benefit to be realized with a reduction in the amount of co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ships were accompanied by russian icebreakers in order to transit the northern sea , the company had to get permission from the rusian authorities .
when that permission came , the ships were escorted by the russian icebreaker " 50 years since victory . "
it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .
there , they picked up two russian icebreakers as escorts and headed to the dutch port of rotterdam . melting ice made journey possible the voyage , using the traditional route , is roughly 11,000 nautical miles -lrb- 12,658 miles -rrb- and passes through the suez canal .
by going over the top of the world , the freighters were able to cut 4,000 nautical miles from that trip .
the savings in fuel costs are substantial .
there is also an environmental benefit to be realized with a reduction in the amount of co2 emissions .

when that permission came , the ships were escorted by the russian icebreaker " 50 years since victory . "
it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .

their appearance at the event was enough for the official chinese delegation to walk out . the two writers travelled to frankfurt though their invitations to the symposium had been revoked after criticism from beijing .
when bei ling and dai qing on saturday addressed the symposium , the official chinese delegation left the room in protest . the delegation returned only after an apology from juergen boos , organizer of the book fair .

their appearance at the event was enough for the official chinese delegation to walk out . the two writers travelled to frankfurt though their invitations to the symposium had been revoked after criticism from beijing .
when bei ling and dai qing on saturday addressed the symposium , the official chinese delegation left the room in protest . the delegation returned only after an apology from juergen boos , organizer of the book fair .
mei zhaorong , former chinese ambassador to germany , said the german hosts had changed the program of the symposium without informing the delegation from beijing . " we did not come here for a lesson in democracy , " mei said .
" those times are over . " the two dissident authors in turn expressed their disappointment at the chinese reaction , saying that such behavior would undermine any constructive discussion . the symposium , entitled " china and the world - perception and reality , " was initially intended to clear up prejudices about the guest country - china - ahead of the 2009 frankfurt book fair , which begins in mid-october . the event had been intended as a promotional preamble but soon became a pr nightmare when china made it clear that if the organizers persisted in including dissident writers , it would pull out of the symposium altogether . the fair 's organizers bowed to chinese pressure and bei ling , dai qing and several other dissident authors found that their invitations had been revoked . dai qing 's last minute flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bei ling is planning to attend the book fair in october dai qing , considered to be one of china 's leading investigative journalists and environmental activists , managed to get a german visa as the guest of the german branch of the pen club of independent writers . when dai got to the airport , however , she found that her plane ticket had been mysteriously cancelled , despite the fact that she 'd twice phoned the travel company to confirm . " they tried so hard to keep me from frankfurt , " dai said ahead of the symposium .

" content at the frankfurt book fair can not be supervised , " he said . this assurance is , however , unlikely to satisfy the author bei ling , who feels that the affair has seriously damaged the event 's credibility . bei was arrested in china in 2000 for " illegal publications " but was released shortly afterward following us intervention .
he had been planning to speak about censorship and self-censorship at the symposium . " i feel it is a shame if the frankfurt book fair can not say ' no ' or they can not control this , " bei told the dpa news agency .

mei zhaorong , former chinese ambassador to germany , said the german hosts had changed the program of the symposium without informing the delegation from beijing . " we did not come here for a lesson in democracy , " mei said .
" those times are over . " the two dissident authors in turn expressed their disappointment at the chinese reaction , saying that such behavior would undermine any constructive discussion . the symposium , entitled " china and the world - perception and reality , " was initially intended to clear up prejudices about the guest country - china - ahead of the 2009 frankfurt book fair , which begins in mid-october . the event had been intended as a promotional preamble but soon became a pr nightmare when china made it clear that if the organizers persisted in including dissident writers , it would pull out of the symposium altogether . the fair 's organizers bowed to chinese pressure and bei ling , dai qing and several other dissident authors found that their invitations had been revoked . dai qing 's last minute flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bei ling is planning to attend the book fair in october dai qing , considered to be one of china 's leading investigative journalists and environmental activists , managed to get a german visa as the guest of the german branch of the pen club of independent writers . when dai got to the airport , however , she found that her plane ticket had been mysteriously cancelled , despite the fact that she 'd twice phoned the travel company to confirm . " they tried so hard to keep me from frankfurt , " dai said ahead of the symposium . " when you hold an international symposium in frankfurt , it should be about giving chinese authors a voice when the central theme is chinese literature , " she added . " the authorities must give some clear arguments as to why i should n't be allowed to express my thoughts . " frankfurt book fair under fire the organizers of the world 's largest book fair have come under heavy criticism from writers and politicians alike .
however , the director of the frankfurt book fair defended the decision to revoke symposium invitations as a necessary compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boos said compromises are necessary china might have its way at the symposium , fair director juergen boos argued , but the annual book fair would be a different matter .
" content at the frankfurt book fair can not be supervised , " he said . this assurance is , however , unlikely to satisfy the author bei ling , who feels that the affair has seriously damaged the event 's credibility . bei was arrested in china in 2000 for " illegal publications " but was released shortly afterward following us intervention .
he had been planning to speak about censorship and self-censorship at the symposium . " i feel it is a shame if the frankfurt book fair can not say ' no ' or they can not control this , " bei told the dpa news agency .
" they decided this year for china to be the guest country , so they have to face all these complicated situations .
but some rules they can not turn back , like freedom of expression . " ai / kl / dpa / epd editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .

although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?
who will ask the questions ?
will the candidates be allowed to address each other ?
all of these issues , and dozens more , must be negotiated between the political parties and the debate 's sponsor .
german debate formats slow to innovate the original american debate format consisted of a panel of journalists posing consecutive questions to kennedy and nixon .
all presidential debates in the us between 1960 and 1988 employed this format , which germany 's debaters continue to use today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate between stoiber , left , and schröder was the first one-on-one duel , since then there 's been little change to the format german debate formats have been remarkably slow to innovate , the key exception being the structural change in 2002 that resulted in a one-on-one duel between schroder and stoiber .
the 2009 debates continue the tradition without significant changes , such as multimedia enhancements , mail-in questions or an interface for video-questions pre-produced by viewers at home .
the joint venture of public networks ard and zdf with private networks rtl and pro7.sat1 brings together four anchorpersons , each representing their own media network - and stealing time from the debate between the candidates .
the debate will be broadcast live by the participating television stations , but there ´ s no online coverage : the networks agreed not to offer live-streaming and will only put up an online video after the debate has finished .
other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .
no matter the format and no matter the country , campaign debates have shown themselves to be of great value to voters , imparting information about politicians and their positions in an audience-friendly way .
the challenge in germany and throughout the world is to ensure that debates are responsive to the needs of citizens first , and second to the needs of political candidates and the media .
after nearly 50 years of on-camera debates , this remains the key struggle .

but complaints of fraud , which have sparked concerns in the west , refuse to die down . in preliminary results announced saturday , afghan electoral authorities reported that incumbent president hamid karzai maintained his lead over his main rival abdullah abdullah with 54.3 percent of the vote .
abdullah , formerly afghanistan 's foreign minister , has 28.1 percent of the vote .
fifty percent of the total votes plus one will be needed to win the election and avoid a runoff .
a spokesman for afghanistan 's independent election commission , daud ali najafi , told news agency afp he was unsure when the full count of votes would be released .
" tommorrow we will sit down with the ecc -lsb- election complaints commission -rsb- and see when we can announce the final results , " najafi said .
the iec said the results included 95 percent of all votes cast , with votes from 92.8 percent of the polling stations counted .
about five percent of the total votes remain uncounted , and the remaining number have been quarantined while the election complaints commission investigates possible fraud .
of the 5.8 million valid votes , karzai had 3,009,559 . abdullah had 1,558,591 .
eu official slams " widespread fraud " allegations of ballot stuffing , voter intimidation , and other fraud have been rampant in the country 's election .
very low turnout could also affect the election 's legitimacy , with estimates that as few as 30 percent of the country 's eligible voters participated .
this week , german european union observer gunter mulack condemned " really widespread fraud " in the elections , citing implausibly high numbers of votes for a single candidate at some voting stations , and more ballots than likely voters at others .
the eu has cautioned candidates against declaring victory before the final results are released .
but observers representing the united states and united kingdom have expressed hope that a fair outcome can still be salvaged from the results .
the us special envoy to afghanistan , richard holbrooke has said that a do-over of the election is " not a viable option . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential contender abdullah abdullah has accused karzai of fraudulently engineering a win afghanistan 's electoral complaints commmission announced this week it had found " clear and convincing evidence of fraud " in 83 polling stations in three provinces , and invalidated all of the ballots collected there .
most of the questionable ballots came from areas known as strongholds for incumbent president hamid karzai , who hails from the southern province of kandahar .
the commission 's investigations in ghazni discovered unfolded ballots , missing material , and voter lists with ficticious card numbers - all indications of fraud. svs / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?
who will ask the questions ?
will the candidates be allowed to address each other ?
all of these issues , and dozens more , must be negotiated between the political parties and the debate 's sponsor .
german debate formats slow to innovate the original american debate format consisted of a panel of journalists posing consecutive questions to kennedy and nixon .
all presidential debates in the us between 1960 and 1988 employed this format , which germany 's debaters continue to use today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate between stoiber , left , and schröder was the first one-on-one duel , since then there 's been little change to the format german debate formats have been remarkably slow to innovate , the key exception being the structural change in 2002 that resulted in a one-on-one duel between schroder and stoiber .
the 2009 debates continue the tradition without significant changes , such as multimedia enhancements , mail-in questions or an interface for video-questions pre-produced by viewers at home .
the joint venture of public networks ard and zdf with private networks rtl and pro7.sat1 brings together four anchorpersons , each representing their own media network - and stealing time from the debate between the candidates .
the debate will be broadcast live by the participating television stations , but there ´ s no online coverage : the networks agreed not to offer live-streaming and will only put up an online video after the debate has finished .
other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .
no matter the format and no matter the country , campaign debates have shown themselves to be of great value to voters , imparting information about politicians and their positions in an audience-friendly way .
the challenge in germany and throughout the world is to ensure that debates are responsive to the needs of citizens first , and second to the needs of political candidates and the media .
after nearly 50 years of on-camera debates , this remains the key struggle .

" we welcome you with open arms .
we hope our talks will be fruitful with a positive outcome , " mugabe said in the capital harare on saturday .
the eu delegation led by karel de gucht , eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , and the swedish eu presidency was also to hold talks with mugabe 's long-time political rival , morgan tsvangirai . the visit is the first since the eu began targeted sanctions in 2002 against members of mugabe 's government for human rights violations .
it marks a thawing in ties between western powers and zimbabwe .
eu officials have described the visit as an attempt to reopen political dialogue with the country . " this is a critical time for zimbabwe and the weight of responsibility falls squarely on the country 's leaders to deliver urgent political , economic and social progress for the benefit of all people of zimbabwe , " de gucht said in a statement ahead of the visit . zimbabwe says it needs $ 10 billion in foreign reconstruction aid .
but western nations are willing to commit further aid without further political and economic reforms as part of a power-sharing deal called the global political agreement -lrb- gpa -rrb- . eu reaffirms sanctions policy a day before the visit , eu officials were forced to defend the bloc 's decision of sticking to sanctions against mugabe and his inner circle . " we are not talking about economic sanctions , " karel de gucht said at the second eu-south africa summit in cape town on friday . de gucht said that the sanctions imposed in 2002 targeted individuals and that they had no impact on the general population . he was responding to calls made at a summit of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- leaders earlier this week .
african leaders meeting in kinshasa had demanded that the zimbabwe sanctions be lifted , arguing that they were obstructing the country 's economic recovery . the eu and the us have said they will not lift sanctions until zimbabwe implements further reforms , especially in the field of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt says zimbabweans are suffering because of homegrown mismanagement swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , pointed out that human rights abuses continued in zimbabwe , including violence directed at supporters of prime minister morgan tsvangirai . " it is not the restrictions that are creating the problems in zimbabwe , it is the mismanagement … not respecting human rights , " said reinfeldt in the south african town of kleinmond , where the summit was taking place . the eu and us implemented the targeted sanctions in 2002 following a disputed presidential poll that extended mugabe 's rule . mugabe 's blame game mugabe has tried to make people believe that zimbabwe 's domestic problems are solely due to western sanctions and that once these are lifted the country will get back on its feet . however , while south african president jacob zuma said the sanctions were obstructing a successful power-sharing deal , he stressed during the summit with eu diplomats that zimbabwe 's problems were older than the sanctions . " i do n't think the sanctions started the problems in the economy .
i think it was the zimbabweans who undermined their own system .
that got the economy into trouble , " said zuma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zuma was unable to sway eu diplomats over the zimbabwe sanctions however , while eu and south african officials differed on the sanctions issue , they did agree on a joint communique in which they urged zimbabwe 's parties to " remove all obstacles " to the country 's power sharing deal and unity government . zimbabweans had hoped the power-sharing deal agreed to by prime minister morgan tsvangirai and president robert mugabe would pave the way for the country 's recovery under a unity government . the deal , which came into effect in february , managed to defuse the violence that ensued after last year 's disputed presidential election , but it has done little to actually change the country 's economic or humanitarian predicament .
power struggles over key posts in the government continue as do human rights abuses and food shortages . mugabe lashes out at west the 85-year-old mugabe reacted promptly to the eu 's announcement that sanctions would remain in place .
speaking at a gathering of his party 's youth wing in harare on friday , he slammed the sanctions and the west . " who said the british and americans should rule over others ? … we have not invited these bloody whites .
they want to poke their nose into our affairs .
refuse that , " mugabe said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's population depends heavily on foreign aid shipments mugabe also made clear on friday that he is still unwilling to back down on controversial land reforms which he implemented in the former british colony nine years ago . " the land reform exercise is irreversible , " mugabe said . mugabe 's government launched the land reforms in a bid to redress colonial grievances .
in the chaotic process that followed white farmers were often violently driven off their property and the land given to black farmers . since then these hitherto productive and efficient farms have often been badly run , which has contributed strongly to the fact that zimbabwe , once africa 's bread basket , is now struggling against food shortages , disease , poverty and hyperinflation . nk / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but complaints of fraud , which have sparked concerns in the west , refuse to die down . in preliminary results announced saturday , afghan electoral authorities reported that incumbent president hamid karzai maintained his lead over his main rival abdullah abdullah with 54.3 percent of the vote .
abdullah , formerly afghanistan 's foreign minister , has 28.1 percent of the vote .
fifty percent of the total votes plus one will be needed to win the election and avoid a runoff .
a spokesman for afghanistan 's independent election commission , daud ali najafi , told news agency afp he was unsure when the full count of votes would be released .
" tommorrow we will sit down with the ecc -lsb- election complaints commission -rsb- and see when we can announce the final results , " najafi said .
the iec said the results included 95 percent of all votes cast , with votes from 92.8 percent of the polling stations counted .
about five percent of the total votes remain uncounted , and the remaining number have been quarantined while the election complaints commission investigates possible fraud .
of the 5.8 million valid votes , karzai had 3,009,559 . abdullah had 1,558,591 .
eu official slams " widespread fraud " allegations of ballot stuffing , voter intimidation , and other fraud have been rampant in the country 's election .
very low turnout could also affect the election 's legitimacy , with estimates that as few as 30 percent of the country 's eligible voters participated .
this week , german european union observer gunter mulack condemned " really widespread fraud " in the elections , citing implausibly high numbers of votes for a single candidate at some voting stations , and more ballots than likely voters at others .
the eu has cautioned candidates against declaring victory before the final results are released .
but observers representing the united states and united kingdom have expressed hope that a fair outcome can still be salvaged from the results .
the us special envoy to afghanistan , richard holbrooke has said that a do-over of the election is " not a viable option . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential contender abdullah abdullah has accused karzai of fraudulently engineering a win afghanistan 's electoral complaints commmission announced this week it had found " clear and convincing evidence of fraud " in 83 polling stations in three provinces , and invalidated all of the ballots collected there .
most of the questionable ballots came from areas known as strongholds for incumbent president hamid karzai , who hails from the southern province of kandahar .
the commission 's investigations in ghazni discovered unfolded ballots , missing material , and voter lists with ficticious card numbers - all indications of fraud. svs / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .
there , they picked up two russian icebreakers as escorts and headed to the dutch port of rotterdam . melting ice made journey possible the voyage , using the traditional route , is roughly 11,000 nautical miles -lrb- 12,658 miles -rrb- and passes through the suez canal .
by going over the top of the world , the freighters were able to cut 4,000 nautical miles from that trip .
the savings in fuel costs are substantial .
there is also an environmental benefit to be realized with a reduction in the amount of co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ships were accompanied by russian icebreakers in order to transit the northern sea , the company had to get permission from the rusian authorities .
when that permission came , the ships were escorted by the russian icebreaker " 50 years since victory . "
it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .

abdullah , formerly afghanistan 's foreign minister , has 28.1 percent of the vote .
fifty percent of the total votes plus one will be needed to win the election and avoid a runoff .
a spokesman for afghanistan 's independent election commission , daud ali najafi , told news agency afp he was unsure when the full count of votes would be released .
" tommorrow we will sit down with the ecc -lsb- election complaints commission -rsb- and see when we can announce the final results , " najafi said .
the iec said the results included 95 percent of all votes cast , with votes from 92.8 percent of the polling stations counted .
about five percent of the total votes remain uncounted , and the remaining number have been quarantined while the election complaints commission investigates possible fraud .
of the 5.8 million valid votes , karzai had 3,009,559 . abdullah had 1,558,591 .
eu official slams " widespread fraud " allegations of ballot stuffing , voter intimidation , and other fraud have been rampant in the country 's election .
very low turnout could also affect the election 's legitimacy , with estimates that as few as 30 percent of the country 's eligible voters participated .
this week , german european union observer gunter mulack condemned " really widespread fraud " in the elections , citing implausibly high numbers of votes for a single candidate at some voting stations , and more ballots than likely voters at others .
the eu has cautioned candidates against declaring victory before the final results are released .
but observers representing the united states and united kingdom have expressed hope that a fair outcome can still be salvaged from the results .
the us special envoy to afghanistan , richard holbrooke has said that a do-over of the election is " not a viable option . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential contender abdullah abdullah has accused karzai of fraudulently engineering a win afghanistan 's electoral complaints commmission announced this week it had found " clear and convincing evidence of fraud " in 83 polling stations in three provinces , and invalidated all of the ballots collected there .
most of the questionable ballots came from areas known as strongholds for incumbent president hamid karzai , who hails from the southern province of kandahar .
the commission 's investigations in ghazni discovered unfolded ballots , missing material , and voter lists with ficticious card numbers - all indications of fraud. svs / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu delegation led by karel de gucht , eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , and the swedish eu presidency was also to hold talks with mugabe 's long-time political rival , morgan tsvangirai . the visit is the first since the eu began targeted sanctions in 2002 against members of mugabe 's government for human rights violations .
it marks a thawing in ties between western powers and zimbabwe .
eu officials have described the visit as an attempt to reopen political dialogue with the country . " this is a critical time for zimbabwe and the weight of responsibility falls squarely on the country 's leaders to deliver urgent political , economic and social progress for the benefit of all people of zimbabwe , " de gucht said in a statement ahead of the visit . zimbabwe says it needs $ 10 billion in foreign reconstruction aid .

" we welcome you with open arms .
we hope our talks will be fruitful with a positive outcome , " mugabe said in the capital harare on saturday .
the eu delegation led by karel de gucht , eu commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , and the swedish eu presidency was also to hold talks with mugabe 's long-time political rival , morgan tsvangirai . the visit is the first since the eu began targeted sanctions in 2002 against members of mugabe 's government for human rights violations .
it marks a thawing in ties between western powers and zimbabwe .

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?
who will ask the questions ?
will the candidates be allowed to address each other ?
all of these issues , and dozens more , must be negotiated between the political parties and the debate 's sponsor .
german debate formats slow to innovate the original american debate format consisted of a panel of journalists posing consecutive questions to kennedy and nixon .
all presidential debates in the us between 1960 and 1988 employed this format , which germany 's debaters continue to use today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate between stoiber , left , and schröder was the first one-on-one duel , since then there 's been little change to the format german debate formats have been remarkably slow to innovate , the key exception being the structural change in 2002 that resulted in a one-on-one duel between schroder and stoiber .
the 2009 debates continue the tradition without significant changes , such as multimedia enhancements , mail-in questions or an interface for video-questions pre-produced by viewers at home .
the joint venture of public networks ard and zdf with private networks rtl and pro7.sat1 brings together four anchorpersons , each representing their own media network - and stealing time from the debate between the candidates .
the debate will be broadcast live by the participating television stations , but there ´ s no online coverage : the networks agreed not to offer live-streaming and will only put up an online video after the debate has finished .
other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .
no matter the format and no matter the country , campaign debates have shown themselves to be of great value to voters , imparting information about politicians and their positions in an audience-friendly way .
the challenge in germany and throughout the world is to ensure that debates are responsive to the needs of citizens first , and second to the needs of political candidates and the media .
after nearly 50 years of on-camera debates , this remains the key struggle .

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?
who will ask the questions ?
will the candidates be allowed to address each other ?
all of these issues , and dozens more , must be negotiated between the political parties and the debate 's sponsor .
german debate formats slow to innovate the original american debate format consisted of a panel of journalists posing consecutive questions to kennedy and nixon .
all presidential debates in the us between 1960 and 1988 employed this format , which germany 's debaters continue to use today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate between stoiber , left , and schröder was the first one-on-one duel , since then there 's been little change to the format german debate formats have been remarkably slow to innovate , the key exception being the structural change in 2002 that resulted in a one-on-one duel between schroder and stoiber .
the 2009 debates continue the tradition without significant changes , such as multimedia enhancements , mail-in questions or an interface for video-questions pre-produced by viewers at home .
the joint venture of public networks ard and zdf with private networks rtl and pro7.sat1 brings together four anchorpersons , each representing their own media network - and stealing time from the debate between the candidates .
the debate will be broadcast live by the participating television stations , but there ´ s no online coverage : the networks agreed not to offer live-streaming and will only put up an online video after the debate has finished .
other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .
no matter the format and no matter the country , campaign debates have shown themselves to be of great value to voters , imparting information about politicians and their positions in an audience-friendly way .
the challenge in germany and throughout the world is to ensure that debates are responsive to the needs of citizens first , and second to the needs of political candidates and the media .
after nearly 50 years of on-camera debates , this remains the key struggle .

debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?

all of these issues , and dozens more , must be negotiated between the political parties and the debate 's sponsor .
german debate formats slow to innovate the original american debate format consisted of a panel of journalists posing consecutive questions to kennedy and nixon .

the 2009 debates continue the tradition without significant changes , such as multimedia enhancements , mail-in questions or an interface for video-questions pre-produced by viewers at home .
the joint venture of public networks ard and zdf with private networks rtl and pro7.sat1 brings together four anchorpersons , each representing their own media network - and stealing time from the debate between the candidates .
the debate will be broadcast live by the participating television stations , but there ´ s no online coverage : the networks agreed not to offer live-streaming and will only put up an online video after the debate has finished .
other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .
no matter the format and no matter the country , campaign debates have shown themselves to be of great value to voters , imparting information about politicians and their positions in an audience-friendly way .
the challenge in germany and throughout the world is to ensure that debates are responsive to the needs of citizens first , and second to the needs of political candidates and the media .
after nearly 50 years of on-camera debates , this remains the key struggle .

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .

abdullah , formerly afghanistan 's foreign minister , has 28.1 percent of the vote .
fifty percent of the total votes plus one will be needed to win the election and avoid a runoff .

but complaints of fraud , which have sparked concerns in the west , refuse to die down . in preliminary results announced saturday , afghan electoral authorities reported that incumbent president hamid karzai maintained his lead over his main rival abdullah abdullah with 54.3 percent of the vote .
abdullah , formerly afghanistan 's foreign minister , has 28.1 percent of the vote .
fifty percent of the total votes plus one will be needed to win the election and avoid a runoff .
a spokesman for afghanistan 's independent election commission , daud ali najafi , told news agency afp he was unsure when the full count of votes would be released .
" tommorrow we will sit down with the ecc -lsb- election complaints commission -rsb- and see when we can announce the final results , " najafi said .
the iec said the results included 95 percent of all votes cast , with votes from 92.8 percent of the polling stations counted .
about five percent of the total votes remain uncounted , and the remaining number have been quarantined while the election complaints commission investigates possible fraud .
of the 5.8 million valid votes , karzai had 3,009,559 . abdullah had 1,558,591 .
eu official slams " widespread fraud " allegations of ballot stuffing , voter intimidation , and other fraud have been rampant in the country 's election .
very low turnout could also affect the election 's legitimacy , with estimates that as few as 30 percent of the country 's eligible voters participated .
this week , german european union observer gunter mulack condemned " really widespread fraud " in the elections , citing implausibly high numbers of votes for a single candidate at some voting stations , and more ballots than likely voters at others .
the eu has cautioned candidates against declaring victory before the final results are released .
but observers representing the united states and united kingdom have expressed hope that a fair outcome can still be salvaged from the results .
the us special envoy to afghanistan , richard holbrooke has said that a do-over of the election is " not a viable option . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential contender abdullah abdullah has accused karzai of fraudulently engineering a win afghanistan 's electoral complaints commmission announced this week it had found " clear and convincing evidence of fraud " in 83 polling stations in three provinces , and invalidated all of the ballots collected there .
most of the questionable ballots came from areas known as strongholds for incumbent president hamid karzai , who hails from the southern province of kandahar .

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .
the two merchant ships , the mv beluga fraternity and the mv beluga foresight had picked up cargo in korea and headed north to the eastern russian port city of vladivostok .
there , they picked up two russian icebreakers as escorts and headed to the dutch port of rotterdam . melting ice made journey possible the voyage , using the traditional route , is roughly 11,000 nautical miles -lrb- 12,658 miles -rrb- and passes through the suez canal .
by going over the top of the world , the freighters were able to cut 4,000 nautical miles from that trip .
the savings in fuel costs are substantial .
there is also an environmental benefit to be realized with a reduction in the amount of co2 emissions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ships were accompanied by russian icebreakers in order to transit the northern sea , the company had to get permission from the rusian authorities .
when that permission came , the ships were escorted by the russian icebreaker " 50 years since victory . "
it was only within the last year that the company discovered there was a possibility of sailing over the top of the earth .
and even then , the passage is only open for two months .
" it was only last summer that satellite pictures revealed that the ice is melting and a small corridor opened which could enable commercial shipping through the northeast passage - if all the circumstances were right and the requirements were met , " stolberg said in an earlier interview with the reuters news service .
by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .
until now , the only vessels that had been traversing the passage were russian submarines and icebreakers. av / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that dream became a reality when two german ships became the first commercial vessels to deliver cargo from asia to europe .
“ we are all very proud and delighted to be the first western shipping company which has successfully transited the legendary northeast-passage and delivered the sensitive cargo safely through this extraordinarily demanding sea area , ” niels stolberg , president and ceo of beluga shipping , said in a statement on their web site .
the northeast passage is a shipping route from the pacific ocean to the atlantic that goes through the arctic region , along the russian and siberian coasts .
the route is usually frozen but rising temperatures in the region caused by global warming have melted much of the ice allowing large ships to go through .

by utilizing the northeast passage , the company was able to save approximately $ 300,000 in costs per vessel . sailing through the passage , the amount saved on fuel was about $ 100,000 per ship .
the two cargo ships have dropped their shipments off in siberia and after picking up more cargo , are now headed back towards europe .

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?
who will ask the questions ?
will the candidates be allowed to address each other ?
all of these issues , and dozens more , must be negotiated between the political parties and the debate 's sponsor .
german debate formats slow to innovate the original american debate format consisted of a panel of journalists posing consecutive questions to kennedy and nixon .
all presidential debates in the us between 1960 and 1988 employed this format , which germany 's debaters continue to use today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate between stoiber , left , and schröder was the first one-on-one duel , since then there 's been little change to the format german debate formats have been remarkably slow to innovate , the key exception being the structural change in 2002 that resulted in a one-on-one duel between schroder and stoiber .
the 2009 debates continue the tradition without significant changes , such as multimedia enhancements , mail-in questions or an interface for video-questions pre-produced by viewers at home .
the joint venture of public networks ard and zdf with private networks rtl and pro7.sat1 brings together four anchorpersons , each representing their own media network - and stealing time from the debate between the candidates .
the debate will be broadcast live by the participating television stations , but there ´ s no online coverage : the networks agreed not to offer live-streaming and will only put up an online video after the debate has finished .
other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .
no matter the format and no matter the country , campaign debates have shown themselves to be of great value to voters , imparting information about politicians and their positions in an audience-friendly way .
the challenge in germany and throughout the world is to ensure that debates are responsive to the needs of citizens first , and second to the needs of political candidates and the media .
after nearly 50 years of on-camera debates , this remains the key struggle .

"
christoph bieber is a political scientist at the university of giessen in germany with an emphasis on political communication and new media and the internet and democracy .
he writes regularly for various weblogs .
long a fixture of western political campaigns , debates are increasingly becoming standard elements of elections around the world .
so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?
who will ask the questions ?
will the candidates be allowed to address each other ?
all of these issues , and dozens more , must be negotiated between the political parties and the debate 's sponsor .
german debate formats slow to innovate the original american debate format consisted of a panel of journalists posing consecutive questions to kennedy and nixon .
all presidential debates in the us between 1960 and 1988 employed this format , which germany 's debaters continue to use today .

the joint venture of public networks ard and zdf with private networks rtl and pro7.sat1 brings together four anchorpersons , each representing their own media network - and stealing time from the debate between the candidates .
the debate will be broadcast live by the participating television stations , but there ´ s no online coverage : the networks agreed not to offer live-streaming and will only put up an online video after the debate has finished .
other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .

so far this year , iran , afghanistan , and mongolia have all held their first election debates in history .
over the past two years , high-profile campaign debates have entertained and informed voters in the united states , france , spain , austria , poland , canada , australia , new zealand , and indonesia - among many other countries .
in the us , last year 's obama-mccain debates drew between 56 and 66 million domestic television viewers , with millions more watching around the world and on the web .
france 's sarkozy-royale matchup in 2007 generated enormous audiences , with 20 million people , or half the country 's registered voters , tuning in .
similarly high levels of viewership accompanied recent debates in spain and poland .
" public viewing " could swell audiences german audiences have also responded enthusiastically to live debates .
both of the 2002 gerhard schröder-edmund stoiber debates attracted 15 million viewers , the single schröder-angela merkel debate in 2005 was followed by an audience of about 21 million - only important matches of the national soccer team are able to compete with those numbers .
since the world cup in 2006 , " public viewing " has been a popular practice to follow media events - the 2009 debate probably will be the first in germany to help gather additional audiences in public places .
although the worldwide popularity of debates is particularly evident at this moment in time , it has taken many decades for the tradition to take root around the globe .
even in countries with established histories of campaign debates , the institution remains fragile , wholly dependent on the willingness of candidates to confront their opponents in a live , unscripted setting .
as history has shown , this can be a dangerous game for its star players , because debates are more easily lost than won .
kennedy-nixon duel began tv debate era the first country to broadcast debates during a national electoral campaign is sweden , where a tradition of radio debates among party politicians dates back to the 1930s .
the swedish example underscores the popularity of these events as political theater . in 1948 , the national leaders ' debate played out before a live audience of more than 30,000 citizens gathered in stockholm 's vasaparken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pundits expected nixon , left , to dominate the debate , however kennedy ran away with it it took america 's kennedy-nixon debates in 1960 to move debates to the burgeoning medium of television .
at the time , political observers were surprised when richard nixon accepted john f. kennedy 's challenge to a series of four joint tv appearances .
although nixon considered himself the superior communicator , it was kennedy who approached the debates more seriously , preparing for the events with long hours of study and intense practice sessions with aides .
kennedy even made sure he had a good tan before the first debate , so that he would not look pale on camera .
in the end , john f. kennedy prevailed as the clear winner , proving the power - and the peril - of live debates .
so frightening was this lesson that another 16 years would pass before the american debate tradition resumed with gerald ford and jimmy carter .
germany joins in in 1969 in the federal republic of germany , the tradition of candidates appearing together on television began in the late 60s .
in 1969 , willy brandt of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- challenged kurt-georg kiesinger of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- to a joint appearance on a news program . like many politicians before and since , kiesinger balked at the prospect of sharing the stage with his opponent .
the cdu leader at first rejected the offer , claiming that " it misbecomes a chancellor to sit on a chair and wait until he is allowed to speak . " public pressure ultimately led kiesinger to reverse his decision , and the program went ahead as a sort of joint press conference , with questions known to brandt and kiesinger ahead of the broadcast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt georg kiesinger , right and willy brandt started the tradition of tv debates in germany in 1972 , the four party leaders of the bundestag took part in west germany 's first televised debates , a series of three programs that included the leaders of all parties .
an overwhelming 84 percent of the electorate watched at least one of the 1972 debates , once again demonstrating the high level of public interest that accompanies these exercises in democratic politics .
debates among west german party leaders were also held in 1976 , 1980 , 1983 , and 1987 , planting a seed that would mature into the chancellors ' debates of the 21st century .
tv debates have global appeal but uk the exception in recent decades , the debate phenomenon has made rapid progress globally , with especially strong growth in the emerging democracies of latin america , asia , and africa .
interestingly , one of the few industrialized societies never to hold a national campaign debate is the united kingdom , despite longstanding british traditions like parliamentary debates and the weekly verbal jousting of " prime minister 's question time . "
so far the uk has only flirted with the idea of live debates .
earlier this year conservative leader david cameron challenged prime minister gordon brown of the labor party to debate " any place , any time , anywhere , " though it remains to be seen if brown will cooperate .
although the existence of campaign debates suggests high-minded democratic ideals , in reality the history of these events has most often been characterized by petty squabbling .
in order for debates to happen , candidates must first agree to participate and self-interested politicians find many reasons to avoid them . in february , after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu refused to appear with his challenger , a satirical television show staged a faux debate with puppets portraying the candidates - the closest israeli voters came to seeing their leaders onstage together .
whatever the country , once politicians agree to participate , an intense behind-the-scenes tug-of-war ensues over how the debate will be formatted and staged .
how many debates will be held , and over what period of time ?
how long will they run ?
will the debaters be seated or standing ?
will the subject matter consist of a single theme or be open to all topics ?
who will ask the questions ?
will the candidates be allowed to address each other ?
all of these issues , and dozens more , must be negotiated between the political parties and the debate 's sponsor .
german debate formats slow to innovate the original american debate format consisted of a panel of journalists posing consecutive questions to kennedy and nixon .
all presidential debates in the us between 1960 and 1988 employed this format , which germany 's debaters continue to use today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate between stoiber , left , and schröder was the first one-on-one duel , since then there 's been little change to the format german debate formats have been remarkably slow to innovate , the key exception being the structural change in 2002 that resulted in a one-on-one duel between schroder and stoiber .
the 2009 debates continue the tradition without significant changes , such as multimedia enhancements , mail-in questions or an interface for video-questions pre-produced by viewers at home .
the joint venture of public networks ard and zdf with private networks rtl and pro7.sat1 brings together four anchorpersons , each representing their own media network - and stealing time from the debate between the candidates .
the debate will be broadcast live by the participating television stations , but there ´ s no online coverage : the networks agreed not to offer live-streaming and will only put up an online video after the debate has finished .
other countries have more eagerly embraced format experimentation .
america 's lengthy election season gives us politicians ample opportunity to test their skills in a wide range of debate situations , including town halls , audience participation via social networking tools , debates online , thematic debates , and youtube debates .
new zealand successfully modified the youtube format for its two prime ministerial debates in 2008 , combining questions submitted by the public on video with follow-ups from a panel of professional reporters .
this mixture achieved the best of both worlds : voter involvement plus the scrutiny of trained journalists .
no matter the format and no matter the country , campaign debates have shown themselves to be of great value to voters , imparting information about politicians and their positions in an audience-friendly way .
the challenge in germany and throughout the world is to ensure that debates are responsive to the needs of citizens first , and second to the needs of political candidates and the media .
after nearly 50 years of on-camera debates , this remains the key struggle .

their appearance at the event was enough for the official chinese delegation to walk out . the two writers travelled to frankfurt though their invitations to the symposium had been revoked after criticism from beijing .
when bei ling and dai qing on saturday addressed the symposium , the official chinese delegation left the room in protest . the delegation returned only after an apology from juergen boos , organizer of the book fair .
mei zhaorong , former chinese ambassador to germany , said the german hosts had changed the program of the symposium without informing the delegation from beijing . " we did not come here for a lesson in democracy , " mei said .
" those times are over . " the two dissident authors in turn expressed their disappointment at the chinese reaction , saying that such behavior would undermine any constructive discussion . the symposium , entitled " china and the world - perception and reality , " was initially intended to clear up prejudices about the guest country - china - ahead of the 2009 frankfurt book fair , which begins in mid-october . the event had been intended as a promotional preamble but soon became a pr nightmare when china made it clear that if the organizers persisted in including dissident writers , it would pull out of the symposium altogether . the fair 's organizers bowed to chinese pressure and bei ling , dai qing and several other dissident authors found that their invitations had been revoked . dai qing 's last minute flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bei ling is planning to attend the book fair in october dai qing , considered to be one of china 's leading investigative journalists and environmental activists , managed to get a german visa as the guest of the german branch of the pen club of independent writers . when dai got to the airport , however , she found that her plane ticket had been mysteriously cancelled , despite the fact that she 'd twice phoned the travel company to confirm . " they tried so hard to keep me from frankfurt , " dai said ahead of the symposium . " when you hold an international symposium in frankfurt , it should be about giving chinese authors a voice when the central theme is chinese literature , " she added . " the authorities must give some clear arguments as to why i should n't be allowed to express my thoughts . " frankfurt book fair under fire the organizers of the world 's largest book fair have come under heavy criticism from writers and politicians alike .
however , the director of the frankfurt book fair defended the decision to revoke symposium invitations as a necessary compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boos said compromises are necessary china might have its way at the symposium , fair director juergen boos argued , but the annual book fair would be a different matter .
" content at the frankfurt book fair can not be supervised , " he said . this assurance is , however , unlikely to satisfy the author bei ling , who feels that the affair has seriously damaged the event 's credibility . bei was arrested in china in 2000 for " illegal publications " but was released shortly afterward following us intervention .
he had been planning to speak about censorship and self-censorship at the symposium . " i feel it is a shame if the frankfurt book fair can not say ' no ' or they can not control this , " bei told the dpa news agency .
" they decided this year for china to be the guest country , so they have to face all these complicated situations .

but complaints of fraud , which have sparked concerns in the west , refuse to die down . in preliminary results announced saturday , afghan electoral authorities reported that incumbent president hamid karzai maintained his lead over his main rival abdullah abdullah with 54.3 percent of the vote .
abdullah , formerly afghanistan 's foreign minister , has 28.1 percent of the vote .
fifty percent of the total votes plus one will be needed to win the election and avoid a runoff .
a spokesman for afghanistan 's independent election commission , daud ali najafi , told news agency afp he was unsure when the full count of votes would be released .
" tommorrow we will sit down with the ecc -lsb- election complaints commission -rsb- and see when we can announce the final results , " najafi said .
the iec said the results included 95 percent of all votes cast , with votes from 92.8 percent of the polling stations counted .
about five percent of the total votes remain uncounted , and the remaining number have been quarantined while the election complaints commission investigates possible fraud .
of the 5.8 million valid votes , karzai had 3,009,559 . abdullah had 1,558,591 .
eu official slams " widespread fraud " allegations of ballot stuffing , voter intimidation , and other fraud have been rampant in the country 's election .
very low turnout could also affect the election 's legitimacy , with estimates that as few as 30 percent of the country 's eligible voters participated .
this week , german european union observer gunter mulack condemned " really widespread fraud " in the elections , citing implausibly high numbers of votes for a single candidate at some voting stations , and more ballots than likely voters at others .
the eu has cautioned candidates against declaring victory before the final results are released .
but observers representing the united states and united kingdom have expressed hope that a fair outcome can still be salvaged from the results .
the us special envoy to afghanistan , richard holbrooke has said that a do-over of the election is " not a viable option . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential contender abdullah abdullah has accused karzai of fraudulently engineering a win afghanistan 's electoral complaints commmission announced this week it had found " clear and convincing evidence of fraud " in 83 polling stations in three provinces , and invalidated all of the ballots collected there .
most of the questionable ballots came from areas known as strongholds for incumbent president hamid karzai , who hails from the southern province of kandahar .
the commission 's investigations in ghazni discovered unfolded ballots , missing material , and voter lists with ficticious card numbers - all indications of fraud. svs / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court did not give the defendants ' ethnicity but their names suggest they are from the muslim uighur minority .
the syringe attacks have raised tension in a long-standing conflict between the uighur and han communities .
xinjiang saw ethnic riots in july and thousands have protested in urumqi , the main city , over the syringe attacks .
robbery the authorities in xinjiang were this week said to be holding 12 suspects in relation to the attacks .

the defendant who was given the longest sentence by the intermediate court of urumqi was named as yilipan yilihamu .
the 19-year-old was jailed for 15 years for stabbing a woman in the buttock at a fruit stall , the official xinhua news agency said .
muhutaerjiang turdi , 34 , and a 22-year-old woman , aimannisha guli , were given sentences of 10 and seven years respectively .
they were convicted of threatening a taxi driver with a syringe and stealing 710 yuan -lrb- $ 103 -rrb- from him .
the chinese government has been struggling to restore calm in xinjiang since the july riots , the worst ethnic unrest in the country for decades .
the violence began on 5 july when an initially peaceful protest by uighur youths , apparently prompted by an earlier riot in a factory in southern china , spiralled out of control - with shops and vehicles burned and passers-by attacked .
about 80 people have been charged over the violence but no date has been set for their trial .
the tension has been exacerbated by the syringe attacks , although their scale and seriousness remains unclear .
urumqi health and police authorities say more than 500 people had been stabbed by hypodermic syringes in urumqi , with about 170 of the victims showing obvious signs of the attacks .
none of the victims have suffered poisoning or other effects .
du xintao , an official with the regional public security department , said the syringe incidents were " terror attacks " trying to " scare residents and create further unrest " .

ibrahim savant , 28 , arafat khan , 28 , and waheed zaman , 25 , were found not guilty of plotting to bomb aircraft .
but jurors at woolwich crown court on monday , failed to decide whether they were guilty of conspiracy to murder .
three other men were convicted of plotting to bomb planes flying between london to north america .
the director of public prosecutions , keir starmer , said he had " considered very carefully " whether to seek the retrial .
he added that he had judged that " there remains a realistic prospect of a conviction against each defendant on the charge of conspiracy to murder " even though two previous juries had been unable to agree on the charge .
he added : " i have concluded that , in this exceptional case , it is in the public interest to seek a further retrial . "
a judge will decide whether the men should face a third trial .
the independent reviewer of terrorism laws , lord carlile , said : " we have to trust judges of that seniority and quality to decide whether it is oppressive to have a third trial or whether in a case of this huge importance , it is in the public interest to see whether a jury can reach a verdict .
" it may be a verdict of guilty .

mr savant is from stoke newington , east london , and mr khan and mr zaman , are both from walthamstow , east london .
on monday , abdulla ahmed ali , 28 , of walthamstow , tanvir hussain , 28 , of leyton , east london , and assad sarwar , 29 , from high wycombe , buckinghamshire , were all found guilty of conspiring to activate bombs disguised as drinks .
the arrests in connection with the plot in august 2006 caused chaos to international aviation and prompted the current restrictions on bringing liquids on board aircraft .

three other men were convicted of plotting to bomb planes flying between london to north america .
the director of public prosecutions , keir starmer , said he had " considered very carefully " whether to seek the retrial .
he added that he had judged that " there remains a realistic prospect of a conviction against each defendant on the charge of conspiracy to murder " even though two previous juries had been unable to agree on the charge .
he added : " i have concluded that , in this exceptional case , it is in the public interest to seek a further retrial . "
a judge will decide whether the men should face a third trial .

he added that he had judged that " there remains a realistic prospect of a conviction against each defendant on the charge of conspiracy to murder " even though two previous juries had been unable to agree on the charge .
he added : " i have concluded that , in this exceptional case , it is in the public interest to seek a further retrial . "
a judge will decide whether the men should face a third trial .
the independent reviewer of terrorism laws , lord carlile , said : " we have to trust judges of that seniority and quality to decide whether it is oppressive to have a third trial or whether in a case of this huge importance , it is in the public interest to see whether a jury can reach a verdict .
" it may be a verdict of guilty .
it may be a verdict which may exonerate these men . "
mr savant is from stoke newington , east london , and mr khan and mr zaman , are both from walthamstow , east london .
on monday , abdulla ahmed ali , 28 , of walthamstow , tanvir hussain , 28 , of leyton , east london , and assad sarwar , 29 , from high wycombe , buckinghamshire , were all found guilty of conspiring to activate bombs disguised as drinks .
the arrests in connection with the plot in august 2006 caused chaos to international aviation and prompted the current restrictions on bringing liquids on board aircraft .
