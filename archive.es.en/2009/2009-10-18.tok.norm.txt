one has already identified a suspect – while both are looking into who the data was released to . schuelervz , an online forum for german teenagers and high school students , has said it has identified the person it suspects of stealing the data , which include the name , age , school , gender , and photo of thousands of users . " we have taken immediate action to prevent another incident like this one from occurring , " an unnamed spokesperson for the site 's parent company , vz , said . " we have found the person we believe is responsible for the theft , and we are investigating to whom the data was released .
at the moment , the suspect is unwilling to tell us to whom he released the data , " the spokesperson added . schuelervz went on to say that especially protected data – such as email addresses , telephone numbers , photo albums , usernames , and passwords – were not part of the stolen data . awd – a second , more serious run-in with data theft bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data theft is nothing new to founder carsten maschmeyer meanwhile , the names , client numbers , addresses , and telephone numbers of tens of thousands of clients of the german financial service provider awd were hacked into and released on the internet , according to german public broadcaster ndr . in addition to those protected data , contract details including client insurance policies and investments were part of the stolen data . awd , however , said most of the stolen information was outdated .
it said the most recent details were from the year 2001 , with most of the data coming from the mid 90s . " no sensitive data was taken here , that is no data that is considered sensitive under data-protection laws .
in particular , there were no bank account numbers taken , " said an unnamed spokesperson . this is not the first time awd has had to deal with data theft .
in 2007 , the company reported that protected data of several of its trade representatives were stolen and released on the internet .
investigations were suspended , however , after the authorities failed to find any suspects . like in that case , awd has opened an investigation with the local hanover authorities .
in addition , an internal workgroup has been commissioned to help with the investigation . the company said on sunday that it had already notified the clients whose data had been stolen . glb / ap / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
it is administered by the german association of publishers and booksellers . author : tomas fitzel -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
it is administered by the german association of publishers and booksellers . author : tomas fitzel -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
it is administered by the german association of publishers and booksellers . author : tomas fitzel -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .

it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .

but two decades after the collapse of communism , critics say it 's time for the church to distance itself from politics . poland 's newest mobile phone network , w rodzinie , promotes itself as a family-friendly service .
the brand 's name means " all in the family . "
it 's the country 's first network to introduce a phone for seniors , with an extra large display and keys .
according to the commercial , it 's perfect for the granny who just ca n't cope with the complicated digital toys offered by the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : father rydzyk caters to those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
but there 's more to the w rodzinie network than meets the eye .
it advertises on just one tv channel and one radio station - tv trwam and radio maryja - both of which are owned by the controversial roman catholic priest father rydzyk .
w rodzinie is the latest addition to his growing media empire , which broadcasts a hardline message into millions of homes .
his audience is known as the " family of radio maryja , " and is mostly made up of those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
they are a political force to be reckoned with .
grazyna , a teacher in her 50 's , lives in warsaw , but often visits her parents in a village in eastern poland , where she says everyone listens to radio maryja .
fundamentalists gaining influence " people in the countryside are influenced by father rydzyk , because it 's a station that 's available everywhere , " she said .
" when you switch on the radio , it 's the first station that you can find .
he tells them what to do and they follow his instructions .
there 's not much logic in it , so i do n't feel convinced by what they say . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rural areas , radio maryja often is the first station that you can find .
father rydzyk recently provoked intense criticism when he made racist jokes at the expense of a baffled african priest who was invited to celebrate mass together with him .
in spite of the uproar , he emerged unscathed .
catholic journalist zbigniew nosowski , editor of the wiez monthly , said that , once again , the country 's roman catholic bishops could n't agree what to do with the troublesome priest .
" groups that can be called catholic fundamentalists have become stronger in recent years , " said nosowski .
" they have become an important player in the public debate .
radio maryja is a classic example .
it 's a big problem for the polish church to have such a large , organized group within itself .
the church in poland is lacking a vision .
poles got used to the fact that we had strong figures like john paul ii , but now we do n't have such strong personalities . "
but the problem is n't just on the side of the church .
since the fall of communism , polish politicians have often been accused of forging a tightly knit relationship with the church .
at a recent international conference on poland 's harsh abortion law , human rights campaigner wanda nowicka showed slides of left-wing leaders keen to be photographed next to roman catholic bishops .
" that shows you the context in which we are working , " she said .
" even the left , which in theory should be pushing for more liberal legislation , is very much dependent on the church . "
more distance needed , critics say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish solidarity movement was closely linked to the catholic church this spells trouble in the long run - not just for the polish political system , but also for the church , according to szymon holownia of the liberal tv channel religia .
" the church is not the place for political agitation , " he said .
" i think we have made some mistakes in this area , where the church became very strongly connected with politics on a social level .
we were creating a new country , a new system , but now everything 's changed , and i think there 's no turning back . "
as radio maryja continues to be the early morning and bedtime listening for millions of poles , politicians who claim to have the backing of the church are free to push their conservative agenda .
this year alone , the polish parliament has passed a law under which pedophiles are to face chemical castration , while the future of ivf treatment in poland is hanging in the balance , with a strong catholic lobby calling for a ban because of what it calls the murder of surplus human embryos produced during the procedure .

but two decades after the collapse of communism , critics say it 's time for the church to distance itself from politics . poland 's newest mobile phone network , w rodzinie , promotes itself as a family-friendly service .
the brand 's name means " all in the family . "
it 's the country 's first network to introduce a phone for seniors , with an extra large display and keys .
according to the commercial , it 's perfect for the granny who just ca n't cope with the complicated digital toys offered by the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : father rydzyk caters to those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
but there 's more to the w rodzinie network than meets the eye .
it advertises on just one tv channel and one radio station - tv trwam and radio maryja - both of which are owned by the controversial roman catholic priest father rydzyk .
w rodzinie is the latest addition to his growing media empire , which broadcasts a hardline message into millions of homes .
his audience is known as the " family of radio maryja , " and is mostly made up of those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
they are a political force to be reckoned with .
grazyna , a teacher in her 50 's , lives in warsaw , but often visits her parents in a village in eastern poland , where she says everyone listens to radio maryja .
fundamentalists gaining influence " people in the countryside are influenced by father rydzyk , because it 's a station that 's available everywhere , " she said .
" when you switch on the radio , it 's the first station that you can find .
he tells them what to do and they follow his instructions .
there 's not much logic in it , so i do n't feel convinced by what they say . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rural areas , radio maryja often is the first station that you can find .
father rydzyk recently provoked intense criticism when he made racist jokes at the expense of a baffled african priest who was invited to celebrate mass together with him .
in spite of the uproar , he emerged unscathed .
catholic journalist zbigniew nosowski , editor of the wiez monthly , said that , once again , the country 's roman catholic bishops could n't agree what to do with the troublesome priest .
" groups that can be called catholic fundamentalists have become stronger in recent years , " said nosowski .
" they have become an important player in the public debate .
radio maryja is a classic example .
it 's a big problem for the polish church to have such a large , organized group within itself .
the church in poland is lacking a vision .
poles got used to the fact that we had strong figures like john paul ii , but now we do n't have such strong personalities . "
but the problem is n't just on the side of the church .
since the fall of communism , polish politicians have often been accused of forging a tightly knit relationship with the church .
at a recent international conference on poland 's harsh abortion law , human rights campaigner wanda nowicka showed slides of left-wing leaders keen to be photographed next to roman catholic bishops .
" that shows you the context in which we are working , " she said .
" even the left , which in theory should be pushing for more liberal legislation , is very much dependent on the church . "
more distance needed , critics say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish solidarity movement was closely linked to the catholic church this spells trouble in the long run - not just for the polish political system , but also for the church , according to szymon holownia of the liberal tv channel religia .
" the church is not the place for political agitation , " he said .
" i think we have made some mistakes in this area , where the church became very strongly connected with politics on a social level .
we were creating a new country , a new system , but now everything 's changed , and i think there 's no turning back . "
as radio maryja continues to be the early morning and bedtime listening for millions of poles , politicians who claim to have the backing of the church are free to push their conservative agenda .
this year alone , the polish parliament has passed a law under which pedophiles are to face chemical castration , while the future of ivf treatment in poland is hanging in the balance , with a strong catholic lobby calling for a ban because of what it calls the murder of surplus human embryos produced during the procedure .

but two decades after the collapse of communism , critics say it 's time for the church to distance itself from politics . poland 's newest mobile phone network , w rodzinie , promotes itself as a family-friendly service .
the brand 's name means " all in the family . "
it 's the country 's first network to introduce a phone for seniors , with an extra large display and keys .
according to the commercial , it 's perfect for the granny who just ca n't cope with the complicated digital toys offered by the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : father rydzyk caters to those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
but there 's more to the w rodzinie network than meets the eye .
it advertises on just one tv channel and one radio station - tv trwam and radio maryja - both of which are owned by the controversial roman catholic priest father rydzyk .
w rodzinie is the latest addition to his growing media empire , which broadcasts a hardline message into millions of homes .
his audience is known as the " family of radio maryja , " and is mostly made up of those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
they are a political force to be reckoned with .
grazyna , a teacher in her 50 's , lives in warsaw , but often visits her parents in a village in eastern poland , where she says everyone listens to radio maryja .
fundamentalists gaining influence " people in the countryside are influenced by father rydzyk , because it 's a station that 's available everywhere , " she said .
" when you switch on the radio , it 's the first station that you can find .
he tells them what to do and they follow his instructions .
there 's not much logic in it , so i do n't feel convinced by what they say . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rural areas , radio maryja often is the first station that you can find .
father rydzyk recently provoked intense criticism when he made racist jokes at the expense of a baffled african priest who was invited to celebrate mass together with him .
in spite of the uproar , he emerged unscathed .
catholic journalist zbigniew nosowski , editor of the wiez monthly , said that , once again , the country 's roman catholic bishops could n't agree what to do with the troublesome priest .
" groups that can be called catholic fundamentalists have become stronger in recent years , " said nosowski .
" they have become an important player in the public debate .
radio maryja is a classic example .
it 's a big problem for the polish church to have such a large , organized group within itself .
the church in poland is lacking a vision .
poles got used to the fact that we had strong figures like john paul ii , but now we do n't have such strong personalities . "
but the problem is n't just on the side of the church .
since the fall of communism , polish politicians have often been accused of forging a tightly knit relationship with the church .
at a recent international conference on poland 's harsh abortion law , human rights campaigner wanda nowicka showed slides of left-wing leaders keen to be photographed next to roman catholic bishops .
" that shows you the context in which we are working , " she said .
" even the left , which in theory should be pushing for more liberal legislation , is very much dependent on the church . "
more distance needed , critics say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish solidarity movement was closely linked to the catholic church this spells trouble in the long run - not just for the polish political system , but also for the church , according to szymon holownia of the liberal tv channel religia .
" the church is not the place for political agitation , " he said .
" i think we have made some mistakes in this area , where the church became very strongly connected with politics on a social level .
we were creating a new country , a new system , but now everything 's changed , and i think there 's no turning back . "
as radio maryja continues to be the early morning and bedtime listening for millions of poles , politicians who claim to have the backing of the church are free to push their conservative agenda .
this year alone , the polish parliament has passed a law under which pedophiles are to face chemical castration , while the future of ivf treatment in poland is hanging in the balance , with a strong catholic lobby calling for a ban because of what it calls the murder of surplus human embryos produced during the procedure .

one has already identified a suspect – while both are looking into who the data was released to . schuelervz , an online forum for german teenagers and high school students , has said it has identified the person it suspects of stealing the data , which include the name , age , school , gender , and photo of thousands of users . " we have taken immediate action to prevent another incident like this one from occurring , " an unnamed spokesperson for the site 's parent company , vz , said . " we have found the person we believe is responsible for the theft , and we are investigating to whom the data was released .
at the moment , the suspect is unwilling to tell us to whom he released the data , " the spokesperson added . schuelervz went on to say that especially protected data – such as email addresses , telephone numbers , photo albums , usernames , and passwords – were not part of the stolen data . awd – a second , more serious run-in with data theft bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data theft is nothing new to founder carsten maschmeyer meanwhile , the names , client numbers , addresses , and telephone numbers of tens of thousands of clients of the german financial service provider awd were hacked into and released on the internet , according to german public broadcaster ndr . in addition to those protected data , contract details including client insurance policies and investments were part of the stolen data . awd , however , said most of the stolen information was outdated .
it said the most recent details were from the year 2001 , with most of the data coming from the mid 90s . " no sensitive data was taken here , that is no data that is considered sensitive under data-protection laws .
in particular , there were no bank account numbers taken , " said an unnamed spokesperson . this is not the first time awd has had to deal with data theft .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
it is administered by the german association of publishers and booksellers . author : tomas fitzel -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair book fair -pipe- 18.10.2009 authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magris spent most of his life living near the iron curtain italian author claudio magris has been awarded the peace prize of the german book trade on sunday .
dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.10.2009 eu industry commissioner defends germany 's opel aid offer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains confident the opel deal will go through despite warnings from the european commission that germany 's proposed 4.5 billion euros in state aid for opel may breach eu competition rules , others in brussels are confident the sale of opel will still go through . guenter verheugen , the european union commissioner for enterprise and industry , has weighed in on the latest speculation that a proposed deal to sell general motors ' european subsidiary opel might go against eu rules .
in an interview on german public radio , verheugen , a german national , remained optimistic that the deal was on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen says the opel deal is right on track " everyone see the necessity or considers it important to give the company a chance , " he said . under the preliminary deal signed last month , austrian-canadian auto parts maker magna and russian state-owned bank sberbank would take a 55 percent share in opel . ten percent of the company 's shares would be held by the employees while rest would remain with general motors . the sale was formally approved by gm and the opel trust but still faces approval from the eu . clearing the eu hurdle in a letter addressed to german minister of economics karl theodor zu guttenberg on friday , eu competition commissioner neelie kroes objected to what she described as " significant indications " that the financial aid promised by the german government was tied to the choice of a specific buyer for opel .
" such a precondition for the aid would be incompatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- state aid and internal market rules , " the statement said .
kroes said general motors , should be " given the opportunity to reconsider the outcome of the bidding process on the basis of written german assurances that aid would be available " irrespective of the investor .
berlin remains confident deal will pass zu guttenberg reacted by saying he remained confident that the opel deal would not be derailed by the commission 's concerns .
he said there might have been " some confusing statements " from the german government but that those could be cleared up with " the right answers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes has raised questions about berlin 's aid offer kroes further argued that state aid " is meant to tackle problems due to the economic and financial crisis , and can not be used to impose political constraints concerning the location of production activities within the eu . "
other eu member states with opel factories have accused berlin of using the promised financial aid as a lever to limit job cuts at german factories .
magna and sberbank are reportedly planning to slash around 10,500 jobs at european plants .

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

but two decades after the collapse of communism , critics say it 's time for the church to distance itself from politics . poland 's newest mobile phone network , w rodzinie , promotes itself as a family-friendly service .
the brand 's name means " all in the family . "
it 's the country 's first network to introduce a phone for seniors , with an extra large display and keys .
according to the commercial , it 's perfect for the granny who just ca n't cope with the complicated digital toys offered by the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : father rydzyk caters to those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
but there 's more to the w rodzinie network than meets the eye .
it advertises on just one tv channel and one radio station - tv trwam and radio maryja - both of which are owned by the controversial roman catholic priest father rydzyk .
w rodzinie is the latest addition to his growing media empire , which broadcasts a hardline message into millions of homes .
his audience is known as the " family of radio maryja , " and is mostly made up of those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
they are a political force to be reckoned with .
grazyna , a teacher in her 50 's , lives in warsaw , but often visits her parents in a village in eastern poland , where she says everyone listens to radio maryja .
fundamentalists gaining influence " people in the countryside are influenced by father rydzyk , because it 's a station that 's available everywhere , " she said .
" when you switch on the radio , it 's the first station that you can find .
he tells them what to do and they follow his instructions .
there 's not much logic in it , so i do n't feel convinced by what they say . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rural areas , radio maryja often is the first station that you can find .
father rydzyk recently provoked intense criticism when he made racist jokes at the expense of a baffled african priest who was invited to celebrate mass together with him .
in spite of the uproar , he emerged unscathed .
catholic journalist zbigniew nosowski , editor of the wiez monthly , said that , once again , the country 's roman catholic bishops could n't agree what to do with the troublesome priest .
" groups that can be called catholic fundamentalists have become stronger in recent years , " said nosowski .
" they have become an important player in the public debate .
radio maryja is a classic example .
it 's a big problem for the polish church to have such a large , organized group within itself .
the church in poland is lacking a vision .
poles got used to the fact that we had strong figures like john paul ii , but now we do n't have such strong personalities . "
but the problem is n't just on the side of the church .
since the fall of communism , polish politicians have often been accused of forging a tightly knit relationship with the church .
at a recent international conference on poland 's harsh abortion law , human rights campaigner wanda nowicka showed slides of left-wing leaders keen to be photographed next to roman catholic bishops .
" that shows you the context in which we are working , " she said .
" even the left , which in theory should be pushing for more liberal legislation , is very much dependent on the church . "
more distance needed , critics say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish solidarity movement was closely linked to the catholic church this spells trouble in the long run - not just for the polish political system , but also for the church , according to szymon holownia of the liberal tv channel religia .
" the church is not the place for political agitation , " he said .
" i think we have made some mistakes in this area , where the church became very strongly connected with politics on a social level .
we were creating a new country , a new system , but now everything 's changed , and i think there 's no turning back . "
as radio maryja continues to be the early morning and bedtime listening for millions of poles , politicians who claim to have the backing of the church are free to push their conservative agenda .
this year alone , the polish parliament has passed a law under which pedophiles are to face chemical castration , while the future of ivf treatment in poland is hanging in the balance , with a strong catholic lobby calling for a ban because of what it calls the murder of surplus human embryos produced during the procedure .

one has already identified a suspect – while both are looking into who the data was released to . schuelervz , an online forum for german teenagers and high school students , has said it has identified the person it suspects of stealing the data , which include the name , age , school , gender , and photo of thousands of users . " we have taken immediate action to prevent another incident like this one from occurring , " an unnamed spokesperson for the site 's parent company , vz , said . " we have found the person we believe is responsible for the theft , and we are investigating to whom the data was released .
at the moment , the suspect is unwilling to tell us to whom he released the data , " the spokesperson added . schuelervz went on to say that especially protected data – such as email addresses , telephone numbers , photo albums , usernames , and passwords – were not part of the stolen data . awd – a second , more serious run-in with data theft bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data theft is nothing new to founder carsten maschmeyer meanwhile , the names , client numbers , addresses , and telephone numbers of tens of thousands of clients of the german financial service provider awd were hacked into and released on the internet , according to german public broadcaster ndr . in addition to those protected data , contract details including client insurance policies and investments were part of the stolen data . awd , however , said most of the stolen information was outdated .
it said the most recent details were from the year 2001 , with most of the data coming from the mid 90s . " no sensitive data was taken here , that is no data that is considered sensitive under data-protection laws .
in particular , there were no bank account numbers taken , " said an unnamed spokesperson . this is not the first time awd has had to deal with data theft .
in 2007 , the company reported that protected data of several of its trade representatives were stolen and released on the internet .
investigations were suspended , however , after the authorities failed to find any suspects . like in that case , awd has opened an investigation with the local hanover authorities .
in addition , an internal workgroup has been commissioned to help with the investigation . the company said on sunday that it had already notified the clients whose data had been stolen . glb / ap / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair book prize -pipe- 18.10.2009 italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magris accepted the award in the paulskirche , frankfurt one of germany 's most prestigious literary prizes has been awarded to a writer whose own life story inspired him to write about european history , culture and conflict . claudio magris has been picked as the winner of the peace prize of the german book trade .
70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .

" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
it is administered by the german association of publishers and booksellers . author : tomas fitzel -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but two decades after the collapse of communism , critics say it 's time for the church to distance itself from politics . poland 's newest mobile phone network , w rodzinie , promotes itself as a family-friendly service .
the brand 's name means " all in the family . "
it 's the country 's first network to introduce a phone for seniors , with an extra large display and keys .
according to the commercial , it 's perfect for the granny who just ca n't cope with the complicated digital toys offered by the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : father rydzyk caters to those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
but there 's more to the w rodzinie network than meets the eye .
it advertises on just one tv channel and one radio station - tv trwam and radio maryja - both of which are owned by the controversial roman catholic priest father rydzyk .
w rodzinie is the latest addition to his growing media empire , which broadcasts a hardline message into millions of homes .
his audience is known as the " family of radio maryja , " and is mostly made up of those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
they are a political force to be reckoned with .
grazyna , a teacher in her 50 's , lives in warsaw , but often visits her parents in a village in eastern poland , where she says everyone listens to radio maryja .
fundamentalists gaining influence " people in the countryside are influenced by father rydzyk , because it 's a station that 's available everywhere , " she said .
" when you switch on the radio , it 's the first station that you can find .
he tells them what to do and they follow his instructions .
there 's not much logic in it , so i do n't feel convinced by what they say . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rural areas , radio maryja often is the first station that you can find .
father rydzyk recently provoked intense criticism when he made racist jokes at the expense of a baffled african priest who was invited to celebrate mass together with him .
in spite of the uproar , he emerged unscathed .
catholic journalist zbigniew nosowski , editor of the wiez monthly , said that , once again , the country 's roman catholic bishops could n't agree what to do with the troublesome priest .
" groups that can be called catholic fundamentalists have become stronger in recent years , " said nosowski .
" they have become an important player in the public debate .
radio maryja is a classic example .
it 's a big problem for the polish church to have such a large , organized group within itself .
the church in poland is lacking a vision .
poles got used to the fact that we had strong figures like john paul ii , but now we do n't have such strong personalities . "
but the problem is n't just on the side of the church .
since the fall of communism , polish politicians have often been accused of forging a tightly knit relationship with the church .
at a recent international conference on poland 's harsh abortion law , human rights campaigner wanda nowicka showed slides of left-wing leaders keen to be photographed next to roman catholic bishops .
" that shows you the context in which we are working , " she said .
" even the left , which in theory should be pushing for more liberal legislation , is very much dependent on the church . "
more distance needed , critics say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish solidarity movement was closely linked to the catholic church this spells trouble in the long run - not just for the polish political system , but also for the church , according to szymon holownia of the liberal tv channel religia .
" the church is not the place for political agitation , " he said .
" i think we have made some mistakes in this area , where the church became very strongly connected with politics on a social level .
we were creating a new country , a new system , but now everything 's changed , and i think there 's no turning back . "
as radio maryja continues to be the early morning and bedtime listening for millions of poles , politicians who claim to have the backing of the church are free to push their conservative agenda .
this year alone , the polish parliament has passed a law under which pedophiles are to face chemical castration , while the future of ivf treatment in poland is hanging in the balance , with a strong catholic lobby calling for a ban because of what it calls the murder of surplus human embryos produced during the procedure .

german catholic priest klaus kniffki stands at the end of a long wooden table saying grace . twelve hungry men and women sit with their backs hunched and heads lowered , waiting for their share of bortsch , or beetroot soup .
" the people can take as much as they want - two or three portions - and most of them will .
for many , this is the only meal of the day , " says the 62-year-old priest .
the meal normally costs 2 leu -lrb- about 12 cents -rrb- , but payment is voluntary .

kniffki , who has lived in the country for 13 years , tries to do as much as he can to help the poor of moldova .

one has already identified a suspect – while both are looking into who the data was released to . schuelervz , an online forum for german teenagers and high school students , has said it has identified the person it suspects of stealing the data , which include the name , age , school , gender , and photo of thousands of users . " we have taken immediate action to prevent another incident like this one from occurring , " an unnamed spokesperson for the site 's parent company , vz , said . " we have found the person we believe is responsible for the theft , and we are investigating to whom the data was released .
at the moment , the suspect is unwilling to tell us to whom he released the data , " the spokesperson added . schuelervz went on to say that especially protected data – such as email addresses , telephone numbers , photo albums , usernames , and passwords – were not part of the stolen data . awd – a second , more serious run-in with data theft bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data theft is nothing new to founder carsten maschmeyer meanwhile , the names , client numbers , addresses , and telephone numbers of tens of thousands of clients of the german financial service provider awd were hacked into and released on the internet , according to german public broadcaster ndr . in addition to those protected data , contract details including client insurance policies and investments were part of the stolen data . awd , however , said most of the stolen information was outdated .
it said the most recent details were from the year 2001 , with most of the data coming from the mid 90s . " no sensitive data was taken here , that is no data that is considered sensitive under data-protection laws .
in particular , there were no bank account numbers taken , " said an unnamed spokesperson . this is not the first time awd has had to deal with data theft .
in 2007 , the company reported that protected data of several of its trade representatives were stolen and released on the internet .
investigations were suspended , however , after the authorities failed to find any suspects . like in that case , awd has opened an investigation with the local hanover authorities .
in addition , an internal workgroup has been commissioned to help with the investigation . the company said on sunday that it had already notified the clients whose data had been stolen . glb / ap / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .

his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .

and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 18.10.2009 a german priest sets an example in europe 's poor house großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kniffki 's work is often obstructed by uncooperative bureaucrats as moldovans leave their impoverished country , a german priest is determined to make life better for those who decide to stay . it 's lunchtime at the soup kitchen in stauceni - a town only eight kilometers from moldova 's capital , chisinau .
german catholic priest klaus kniffki stands at the end of a long wooden table saying grace . twelve hungry men and women sit with their backs hunched and heads lowered , waiting for their share of bortsch , or beetroot soup .
" the people can take as much as they want - two or three portions - and most of them will .
for many , this is the only meal of the day , " says the 62-year-old priest .
the meal normally costs 2 leu -lrb- about 12 cents -rrb- , but payment is voluntary .
up to 100 needy people come to the soup kitchen every day , according to kniffki .
" hardly anyone pays , " says the priest with just a hint of disappointment .
living on 140 euros per month the young republic of moldova , which gained independence from the disintegrating soviet union on 27 august 1991 , is one of the poorest countries in europe .
the average monthly income per head was around 140 euros in 2008 .
moldova 's countryside provides ample proof of how impoverished the eastern european state really is .
kniffki leaves the village of stauceni and after just a few miles the streets become dusty .
when it rains everything turns into a muddy quagmire , he says .
people have access to electricity but there 's no running water .
at first sight , the front gardens appear idyllic , but these are the sole property of the people who often use the small patches for keeping chickens or a cow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people ca n't pay their way in the soup kitchen kniffki visits an old woman who is tending to her sick son pavel .
the young man used to be a soldier stationed in the russian town of sotchi .
two years after leaving home he was returned to his mother , having lost the power of speech and covered in bedsores .
he spends his days just sitting in his chair without moving and traumatized . his mother always sleeps beside him .
" we have no way of finding out what happened to him .
that will stay his secret .
but we treated all of his wounds , " the priest says , passing his hand gently over pavel 's head .
back at the priests ' house , sister liliana shows photos of other sick people .
once a week , she drives through the villages and seeks out the most severe cases , then bathes patients at the church 's welfare station .
" the people have no sanitation facilities .
they are bedridden .
they can not leave the house , and they are poor , " she says .
battling windmills one-fourth of the country 's four million citizens have already left moldova in search of a better life abroad .
it 's mostly the aged and children that stay behind , the latter often growing up with just one parent .
kniffki , who has lived in the country for 13 years , tries to do as much as he can to help the poor of moldova .
alongside the welfare station and the soup kitchen , the catholic church has also financed a homeless shelter and a nursery school .
but he has n't always found politicians eager to help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with an average income of 140 euros per head , poultry is a welcome backup a couple of years ago , a severe heat wave led to water shortages in the region .
" back then we went to the mayor and asked him to supply water for the children , " the priest recounts .
but instead of help , they got a terse reply : " then close the nursery school . "
last month , moldova ’ s parliament approved a new reformist government which has promised to move the former soviet republic closer to europe .
kniffki said he hopes the new pro-western government will be able to improve the situation in the country .
in the meantime , kniffki will continue to feed the hungry .

german catholic priest klaus kniffki stands at the end of a long wooden table saying grace . twelve hungry men and women sit with their backs hunched and heads lowered , waiting for their share of bortsch , or beetroot soup .
" the people can take as much as they want - two or three portions - and most of them will .
for many , this is the only meal of the day , " says the 62-year-old priest .
the meal normally costs 2 leu -lrb- about 12 cents -rrb- , but payment is voluntary .
up to 100 needy people come to the soup kitchen every day , according to kniffki .
" hardly anyone pays , " says the priest with just a hint of disappointment .
living on 140 euros per month the young republic of moldova , which gained independence from the disintegrating soviet union on 27 august 1991 , is one of the poorest countries in europe .
the average monthly income per head was around 140 euros in 2008 .
moldova 's countryside provides ample proof of how impoverished the eastern european state really is .
kniffki leaves the village of stauceni and after just a few miles the streets become dusty .

two years after leaving home he was returned to his mother , having lost the power of speech and covered in bedsores .
he spends his days just sitting in his chair without moving and traumatized . his mother always sleeps beside him .
" we have no way of finding out what happened to him .
that will stay his secret .
but we treated all of his wounds , " the priest says , passing his hand gently over pavel 's head .
back at the priests ' house , sister liliana shows photos of other sick people .
once a week , she drives through the villages and seeks out the most severe cases , then bathes patients at the church 's welfare station .
" the people have no sanitation facilities .
they are bedridden .

battling windmills one-fourth of the country 's four million citizens have already left moldova in search of a better life abroad .
it 's mostly the aged and children that stay behind , the latter often growing up with just one parent .
kniffki , who has lived in the country for 13 years , tries to do as much as he can to help the poor of moldova .
alongside the welfare station and the soup kitchen , the catholic church has also financed a homeless shelter and a nursery school .

" back then we went to the mayor and asked him to supply water for the children , " the priest recounts .
but instead of help , they got a terse reply : " then close the nursery school . "
last month , moldova ’ s parliament approved a new reformist government which has promised to move the former soviet republic closer to europe .
kniffki said he hopes the new pro-western government will be able to improve the situation in the country .
in the meantime , kniffki will continue to feed the hungry .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
it is administered by the german association of publishers and booksellers . author : tomas fitzel -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
it is administered by the german association of publishers and booksellers . author : tomas fitzel -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
it is administered by the german association of publishers and booksellers . author : tomas fitzel -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but two decades after the collapse of communism , critics say it 's time for the church to distance itself from politics . poland 's newest mobile phone network , w rodzinie , promotes itself as a family-friendly service .
the brand 's name means " all in the family . "
it 's the country 's first network to introduce a phone for seniors , with an extra large display and keys .
according to the commercial , it 's perfect for the granny who just ca n't cope with the complicated digital toys offered by the competition .

but there 's more to the w rodzinie network than meets the eye .
it advertises on just one tv channel and one radio station - tv trwam and radio maryja - both of which are owned by the controversial roman catholic priest father rydzyk .
w rodzinie is the latest addition to his growing media empire , which broadcasts a hardline message into millions of homes .
his audience is known as the " family of radio maryja , " and is mostly made up of those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
they are a political force to be reckoned with .
grazyna , a teacher in her 50 's , lives in warsaw , but often visits her parents in a village in eastern poland , where she says everyone listens to radio maryja .
fundamentalists gaining influence " people in the countryside are influenced by father rydzyk , because it 's a station that 's available everywhere , " she said .
" when you switch on the radio , it 's the first station that you can find .
he tells them what to do and they follow his instructions .
there 's not much logic in it , so i do n't feel convinced by what they say . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rural areas , radio maryja often is the first station that you can find .
father rydzyk recently provoked intense criticism when he made racist jokes at the expense of a baffled african priest who was invited to celebrate mass together with him .
in spite of the uproar , he emerged unscathed .
catholic journalist zbigniew nosowski , editor of the wiez monthly , said that , once again , the country 's roman catholic bishops could n't agree what to do with the troublesome priest .
" groups that can be called catholic fundamentalists have become stronger in recent years , " said nosowski .
" they have become an important player in the public debate .
radio maryja is a classic example .
it 's a big problem for the polish church to have such a large , organized group within itself .
the church in poland is lacking a vision .
poles got used to the fact that we had strong figures like john paul ii , but now we do n't have such strong personalities . "
but the problem is n't just on the side of the church .
since the fall of communism , polish politicians have often been accused of forging a tightly knit relationship with the church .
at a recent international conference on poland 's harsh abortion law , human rights campaigner wanda nowicka showed slides of left-wing leaders keen to be photographed next to roman catholic bishops .
" that shows you the context in which we are working , " she said .
" even the left , which in theory should be pushing for more liberal legislation , is very much dependent on the church . "
more distance needed , critics say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish solidarity movement was closely linked to the catholic church this spells trouble in the long run - not just for the polish political system , but also for the church , according to szymon holownia of the liberal tv channel religia .
" the church is not the place for political agitation , " he said .
" i think we have made some mistakes in this area , where the church became very strongly connected with politics on a social level .
we were creating a new country , a new system , but now everything 's changed , and i think there 's no turning back . "
as radio maryja continues to be the early morning and bedtime listening for millions of poles , politicians who claim to have the backing of the church are free to push their conservative agenda .
this year alone , the polish parliament has passed a law under which pedophiles are to face chemical castration , while the future of ivf treatment in poland is hanging in the balance , with a strong catholic lobby calling for a ban because of what it calls the murder of surplus human embryos produced during the procedure .

but two decades after the collapse of communism , critics say it 's time for the church to distance itself from politics . poland 's newest mobile phone network , w rodzinie , promotes itself as a family-friendly service .
the brand 's name means " all in the family . "
it 's the country 's first network to introduce a phone for seniors , with an extra large display and keys .
according to the commercial , it 's perfect for the granny who just ca n't cope with the complicated digital toys offered by the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : father rydzyk caters to those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
but there 's more to the w rodzinie network than meets the eye .
it advertises on just one tv channel and one radio station - tv trwam and radio maryja - both of which are owned by the controversial roman catholic priest father rydzyk .
w rodzinie is the latest addition to his growing media empire , which broadcasts a hardline message into millions of homes .
his audience is known as the " family of radio maryja , " and is mostly made up of those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
they are a political force to be reckoned with .
grazyna , a teacher in her 50 's , lives in warsaw , but often visits her parents in a village in eastern poland , where she says everyone listens to radio maryja .
fundamentalists gaining influence " people in the countryside are influenced by father rydzyk , because it 's a station that 's available everywhere , " she said .
" when you switch on the radio , it 's the first station that you can find .
he tells them what to do and they follow his instructions .
there 's not much logic in it , so i do n't feel convinced by what they say . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rural areas , radio maryja often is the first station that you can find .
father rydzyk recently provoked intense criticism when he made racist jokes at the expense of a baffled african priest who was invited to celebrate mass together with him .
in spite of the uproar , he emerged unscathed .
catholic journalist zbigniew nosowski , editor of the wiez monthly , said that , once again , the country 's roman catholic bishops could n't agree what to do with the troublesome priest .
" groups that can be called catholic fundamentalists have become stronger in recent years , " said nosowski .
" they have become an important player in the public debate .
radio maryja is a classic example .
it 's a big problem for the polish church to have such a large , organized group within itself .
the church in poland is lacking a vision .
poles got used to the fact that we had strong figures like john paul ii , but now we do n't have such strong personalities . "
but the problem is n't just on the side of the church .
since the fall of communism , polish politicians have often been accused of forging a tightly knit relationship with the church .
at a recent international conference on poland 's harsh abortion law , human rights campaigner wanda nowicka showed slides of left-wing leaders keen to be photographed next to roman catholic bishops .
" that shows you the context in which we are working , " she said .
" even the left , which in theory should be pushing for more liberal legislation , is very much dependent on the church . "
more distance needed , critics say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish solidarity movement was closely linked to the catholic church this spells trouble in the long run - not just for the polish political system , but also for the church , according to szymon holownia of the liberal tv channel religia .
" the church is not the place for political agitation , " he said .
" i think we have made some mistakes in this area , where the church became very strongly connected with politics on a social level .
we were creating a new country , a new system , but now everything 's changed , and i think there 's no turning back . "
as radio maryja continues to be the early morning and bedtime listening for millions of poles , politicians who claim to have the backing of the church are free to push their conservative agenda .
this year alone , the polish parliament has passed a law under which pedophiles are to face chemical castration , while the future of ivf treatment in poland is hanging in the balance , with a strong catholic lobby calling for a ban because of what it calls the murder of surplus human embryos produced during the procedure .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .

german catholic priest klaus kniffki stands at the end of a long wooden table saying grace . twelve hungry men and women sit with their backs hunched and heads lowered , waiting for their share of bortsch , or beetroot soup .
" the people can take as much as they want - two or three portions - and most of them will .

the meal normally costs 2 leu -lrb- about 12 cents -rrb- , but payment is voluntary .

as radio maryja continues to be the early morning and bedtime listening for millions of poles , politicians who claim to have the backing of the church are free to push their conservative agenda .
this year alone , the polish parliament has passed a law under which pedophiles are to face chemical castration , while the future of ivf treatment in poland is hanging in the balance , with a strong catholic lobby calling for a ban because of what it calls the murder of surplus human embryos produced during the procedure .

german catholic priest klaus kniffki stands at the end of a long wooden table saying grace . twelve hungry men and women sit with their backs hunched and heads lowered , waiting for their share of bortsch , or beetroot soup .
" the people can take as much as they want - two or three portions - and most of them will .

the meal normally costs 2 leu -lrb- about 12 cents -rrb- , but payment is voluntary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair book fair -pipe- 18.10.2009 authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magris spent most of his life living near the iron curtain italian author claudio magris has been awarded the peace prize of the german book trade on sunday .
dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

in an interview on german public radio , verheugen , a german national , remained optimistic that the deal was on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen says the opel deal is right on track " everyone see the necessity or considers it important to give the company a chance , " he said . under the preliminary deal signed last month , austrian-canadian auto parts maker magna and russian state-owned bank sberbank would take a 55 percent share in opel . ten percent of the company 's shares would be held by the employees while rest would remain with general motors . the sale was formally approved by gm and the opel trust but still faces approval from the eu . clearing the eu hurdle in a letter addressed to german minister of economics karl theodor zu guttenberg on friday , eu competition commissioner neelie kroes objected to what she described as " significant indications " that the financial aid promised by the german government was tied to the choice of a specific buyer for opel .
" such a precondition for the aid would be incompatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- state aid and internal market rules , " the statement said .
kroes said general motors , should be " given the opportunity to reconsider the outcome of the bidding process on the basis of written german assurances that aid would be available " irrespective of the investor .
berlin remains confident deal will pass zu guttenberg reacted by saying he remained confident that the opel deal would not be derailed by the commission 's concerns .
he said there might have been " some confusing statements " from the german government but that those could be cleared up with " the right answers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes has raised questions about berlin 's aid offer kroes further argued that state aid " is meant to tackle problems due to the economic and financial crisis , and can not be used to impose political constraints concerning the location of production activities within the eu . "
other eu member states with opel factories have accused berlin of using the promised financial aid as a lever to limit job cuts at german factories .
magna and sberbank are reportedly planning to slash around 10,500 jobs at european plants .
opel employs more than 50,000 people at plants in austria , belgium , britain , hungary , poland and spain .
the eu commission , which enforces the eu 's competition laws , has the power to block such takeovers .
but its decisions can be challenged in the european court. mz / nk / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview on german public radio , verheugen , a german national , remained optimistic that the deal was on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen says the opel deal is right on track " everyone see the necessity or considers it important to give the company a chance , " he said . under the preliminary deal signed last month , austrian-canadian auto parts maker magna and russian state-owned bank sberbank would take a 55 percent share in opel . ten percent of the company 's shares would be held by the employees while rest would remain with general motors . the sale was formally approved by gm and the opel trust but still faces approval from the eu . clearing the eu hurdle in a letter addressed to german minister of economics karl theodor zu guttenberg on friday , eu competition commissioner neelie kroes objected to what she described as " significant indications " that the financial aid promised by the german government was tied to the choice of a specific buyer for opel .
" such a precondition for the aid would be incompatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- state aid and internal market rules , " the statement said .
kroes said general motors , should be " given the opportunity to reconsider the outcome of the bidding process on the basis of written german assurances that aid would be available " irrespective of the investor .
berlin remains confident deal will pass zu guttenberg reacted by saying he remained confident that the opel deal would not be derailed by the commission 's concerns .
he said there might have been " some confusing statements " from the german government but that those could be cleared up with " the right answers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes has raised questions about berlin 's aid offer kroes further argued that state aid " is meant to tackle problems due to the economic and financial crisis , and can not be used to impose political constraints concerning the location of production activities within the eu . "
other eu member states with opel factories have accused berlin of using the promised financial aid as a lever to limit job cuts at german factories .
magna and sberbank are reportedly planning to slash around 10,500 jobs at european plants .
opel employs more than 50,000 people at plants in austria , belgium , britain , hungary , poland and spain .
the eu commission , which enforces the eu 's competition laws , has the power to block such takeovers .
but its decisions can be challenged in the european court. mz / nk / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.10.2009 eu industry commissioner defends germany 's opel aid offer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains confident the opel deal will go through despite warnings from the european commission that germany 's proposed 4.5 billion euros in state aid for opel may breach eu competition rules , others in brussels are confident the sale of opel will still go through . guenter verheugen , the european union commissioner for enterprise and industry , has weighed in on the latest speculation that a proposed deal to sell general motors ' european subsidiary opel might go against eu rules .
in an interview on german public radio , verheugen , a german national , remained optimistic that the deal was on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen says the opel deal is right on track " everyone see the necessity or considers it important to give the company a chance , " he said . under the preliminary deal signed last month , austrian-canadian auto parts maker magna and russian state-owned bank sberbank would take a 55 percent share in opel . ten percent of the company 's shares would be held by the employees while rest would remain with general motors . the sale was formally approved by gm and the opel trust but still faces approval from the eu . clearing the eu hurdle in a letter addressed to german minister of economics karl theodor zu guttenberg on friday , eu competition commissioner neelie kroes objected to what she described as " significant indications " that the financial aid promised by the german government was tied to the choice of a specific buyer for opel .
" such a precondition for the aid would be incompatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- state aid and internal market rules , " the statement said .
kroes said general motors , should be " given the opportunity to reconsider the outcome of the bidding process on the basis of written german assurances that aid would be available " irrespective of the investor .
berlin remains confident deal will pass zu guttenberg reacted by saying he remained confident that the opel deal would not be derailed by the commission 's concerns .
he said there might have been " some confusing statements " from the german government but that those could be cleared up with " the right answers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes has raised questions about berlin 's aid offer kroes further argued that state aid " is meant to tackle problems due to the economic and financial crisis , and can not be used to impose political constraints concerning the location of production activities within the eu . "
other eu member states with opel factories have accused berlin of using the promised financial aid as a lever to limit job cuts at german factories .
magna and sberbank are reportedly planning to slash around 10,500 jobs at european plants .
opel employs more than 50,000 people at plants in austria , belgium , britain , hungary , poland and spain .
the eu commission , which enforces the eu 's competition laws , has the power to block such takeovers .
but its decisions can be challenged in the european court. mz / nk / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview on german public radio , verheugen , a german national , remained optimistic that the deal was on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen says the opel deal is right on track " everyone see the necessity or considers it important to give the company a chance , " he said . under the preliminary deal signed last month , austrian-canadian auto parts maker magna and russian state-owned bank sberbank would take a 55 percent share in opel . ten percent of the company 's shares would be held by the employees while rest would remain with general motors . the sale was formally approved by gm and the opel trust but still faces approval from the eu . clearing the eu hurdle in a letter addressed to german minister of economics karl theodor zu guttenberg on friday , eu competition commissioner neelie kroes objected to what she described as " significant indications " that the financial aid promised by the german government was tied to the choice of a specific buyer for opel .
" such a precondition for the aid would be incompatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- state aid and internal market rules , " the statement said .
kroes said general motors , should be " given the opportunity to reconsider the outcome of the bidding process on the basis of written german assurances that aid would be available " irrespective of the investor .
berlin remains confident deal will pass zu guttenberg reacted by saying he remained confident that the opel deal would not be derailed by the commission 's concerns .
he said there might have been " some confusing statements " from the german government but that those could be cleared up with " the right answers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes has raised questions about berlin 's aid offer kroes further argued that state aid " is meant to tackle problems due to the economic and financial crisis , and can not be used to impose political constraints concerning the location of production activities within the eu . "
other eu member states with opel factories have accused berlin of using the promised financial aid as a lever to limit job cuts at german factories .
magna and sberbank are reportedly planning to slash around 10,500 jobs at european plants .
opel employs more than 50,000 people at plants in austria , belgium , britain , hungary , poland and spain .
the eu commission , which enforces the eu 's competition laws , has the power to block such takeovers .
but its decisions can be challenged in the european court. mz / nk / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.10.2009 eu industry commissioner defends germany 's opel aid offer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany remains confident the opel deal will go through despite warnings from the european commission that germany 's proposed 4.5 billion euros in state aid for opel may breach eu competition rules , others in brussels are confident the sale of opel will still go through . guenter verheugen , the european union commissioner for enterprise and industry , has weighed in on the latest speculation that a proposed deal to sell general motors ' european subsidiary opel might go against eu rules .
in an interview on german public radio , verheugen , a german national , remained optimistic that the deal was on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen says the opel deal is right on track " everyone see the necessity or considers it important to give the company a chance , " he said . under the preliminary deal signed last month , austrian-canadian auto parts maker magna and russian state-owned bank sberbank would take a 55 percent share in opel . ten percent of the company 's shares would be held by the employees while rest would remain with general motors . the sale was formally approved by gm and the opel trust but still faces approval from the eu . clearing the eu hurdle in a letter addressed to german minister of economics karl theodor zu guttenberg on friday , eu competition commissioner neelie kroes objected to what she described as " significant indications " that the financial aid promised by the german government was tied to the choice of a specific buyer for opel .
" such a precondition for the aid would be incompatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- state aid and internal market rules , " the statement said .
kroes said general motors , should be " given the opportunity to reconsider the outcome of the bidding process on the basis of written german assurances that aid would be available " irrespective of the investor .
berlin remains confident deal will pass zu guttenberg reacted by saying he remained confident that the opel deal would not be derailed by the commission 's concerns .
he said there might have been " some confusing statements " from the german government but that those could be cleared up with " the right answers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes has raised questions about berlin 's aid offer kroes further argued that state aid " is meant to tackle problems due to the economic and financial crisis , and can not be used to impose political constraints concerning the location of production activities within the eu . "
other eu member states with opel factories have accused berlin of using the promised financial aid as a lever to limit job cuts at german factories .
magna and sberbank are reportedly planning to slash around 10,500 jobs at european plants .
opel employs more than 50,000 people at plants in austria , belgium , britain , hungary , poland and spain .
the eu commission , which enforces the eu 's competition laws , has the power to block such takeovers .
but its decisions can be challenged in the european court. mz / nk / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair book fair -pipe- 18.10.2009 authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magris spent most of his life living near the iron curtain italian author claudio magris has been awarded the peace prize of the german book trade on sunday .
dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
it is administered by the german association of publishers and booksellers . author : tomas fitzel -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

catholic journalist zbigniew nosowski , editor of the wiez monthly , said that , once again , the country 's roman catholic bishops could n't agree what to do with the troublesome priest .
" groups that can be called catholic fundamentalists have become stronger in recent years , " said nosowski .
" they have become an important player in the public debate .
radio maryja is a classic example .
it 's a big problem for the polish church to have such a large , organized group within itself .

" that shows you the context in which we are working , " she said .
" even the left , which in theory should be pushing for more liberal legislation , is very much dependent on the church . "
more distance needed , critics say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish solidarity movement was closely linked to the catholic church this spells trouble in the long run - not just for the polish political system , but also for the church , according to szymon holownia of the liberal tv channel religia .

we were creating a new country , a new system , but now everything 's changed , and i think there 's no turning back . "
as radio maryja continues to be the early morning and bedtime listening for millions of poles , politicians who claim to have the backing of the church are free to push their conservative agenda .
this year alone , the polish parliament has passed a law under which pedophiles are to face chemical castration , while the future of ivf treatment in poland is hanging in the balance , with a strong catholic lobby calling for a ban because of what it calls the murder of surplus human embryos produced during the procedure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 18.10.2009 a german priest sets an example in europe 's poor house großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kniffki 's work is often obstructed by uncooperative bureaucrats as moldovans leave their impoverished country , a german priest is determined to make life better for those who decide to stay . it 's lunchtime at the soup kitchen in stauceni - a town only eight kilometers from moldova 's capital , chisinau .
german catholic priest klaus kniffki stands at the end of a long wooden table saying grace . twelve hungry men and women sit with their backs hunched and heads lowered , waiting for their share of bortsch , or beetroot soup .
" the people can take as much as they want - two or three portions - and most of them will .
for many , this is the only meal of the day , " says the 62-year-old priest .
the meal normally costs 2 leu -lrb- about 12 cents -rrb- , but payment is voluntary .
up to 100 needy people come to the soup kitchen every day , according to kniffki .
" hardly anyone pays , " says the priest with just a hint of disappointment .
living on 140 euros per month the young republic of moldova , which gained independence from the disintegrating soviet union on 27 august 1991 , is one of the poorest countries in europe .
the average monthly income per head was around 140 euros in 2008 .
moldova 's countryside provides ample proof of how impoverished the eastern european state really is .
kniffki leaves the village of stauceni and after just a few miles the streets become dusty .
when it rains everything turns into a muddy quagmire , he says .
people have access to electricity but there 's no running water .
at first sight , the front gardens appear idyllic , but these are the sole property of the people who often use the small patches for keeping chickens or a cow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people ca n't pay their way in the soup kitchen kniffki visits an old woman who is tending to her sick son pavel .
the young man used to be a soldier stationed in the russian town of sotchi .
two years after leaving home he was returned to his mother , having lost the power of speech and covered in bedsores .
he spends his days just sitting in his chair without moving and traumatized . his mother always sleeps beside him .
" we have no way of finding out what happened to him .
that will stay his secret .
but we treated all of his wounds , " the priest says , passing his hand gently over pavel 's head .
back at the priests ' house , sister liliana shows photos of other sick people .
once a week , she drives through the villages and seeks out the most severe cases , then bathes patients at the church 's welfare station .
" the people have no sanitation facilities .
they are bedridden .
they can not leave the house , and they are poor , " she says .
battling windmills one-fourth of the country 's four million citizens have already left moldova in search of a better life abroad .
it 's mostly the aged and children that stay behind , the latter often growing up with just one parent .

german catholic priest klaus kniffki stands at the end of a long wooden table saying grace . twelve hungry men and women sit with their backs hunched and heads lowered , waiting for their share of bortsch , or beetroot soup .
" the people can take as much as they want - two or three portions - and most of them will .
for many , this is the only meal of the day , " says the 62-year-old priest .
the meal normally costs 2 leu -lrb- about 12 cents -rrb- , but payment is voluntary .
up to 100 needy people come to the soup kitchen every day , according to kniffki .
" hardly anyone pays , " says the priest with just a hint of disappointment .
living on 140 euros per month the young republic of moldova , which gained independence from the disintegrating soviet union on 27 august 1991 , is one of the poorest countries in europe .
the average monthly income per head was around 140 euros in 2008 .
moldova 's countryside provides ample proof of how impoverished the eastern european state really is .
kniffki leaves the village of stauceni and after just a few miles the streets become dusty .

he spends his days just sitting in his chair without moving and traumatized . his mother always sleeps beside him .
" we have no way of finding out what happened to him .
that will stay his secret .
but we treated all of his wounds , " the priest says , passing his hand gently over pavel 's head .
back at the priests ' house , sister liliana shows photos of other sick people .
once a week , she drives through the villages and seeks out the most severe cases , then bathes patients at the church 's welfare station .

they can not leave the house , and they are poor , " she says .
battling windmills one-fourth of the country 's four million citizens have already left moldova in search of a better life abroad .
it 's mostly the aged and children that stay behind , the latter often growing up with just one parent .
kniffki , who has lived in the country for 13 years , tries to do as much as he can to help the poor of moldova .
alongside the welfare station and the soup kitchen , the catholic church has also financed a homeless shelter and a nursery school .
but he has n't always found politicians eager to help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with an average income of 140 euros per head , poultry is a welcome backup a couple of years ago , a severe heat wave led to water shortages in the region .
" back then we went to the mayor and asked him to supply water for the children , " the priest recounts .
but instead of help , they got a terse reply : " then close the nursery school . "
last month , moldova ’ s parliament approved a new reformist government which has promised to move the former soviet republic closer to europe .
kniffki said he hopes the new pro-western government will be able to improve the situation in the country .
in the meantime , kniffki will continue to feed the hungry .

but two decades after the collapse of communism , critics say it 's time for the church to distance itself from politics . poland 's newest mobile phone network , w rodzinie , promotes itself as a family-friendly service .
the brand 's name means " all in the family . "

but there 's more to the w rodzinie network than meets the eye .
it advertises on just one tv channel and one radio station - tv trwam and radio maryja - both of which are owned by the controversial roman catholic priest father rydzyk .
w rodzinie is the latest addition to his growing media empire , which broadcasts a hardline message into millions of homes .
his audience is known as the " family of radio maryja , " and is mostly made up of those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .

father rydzyk recently provoked intense criticism when he made racist jokes at the expense of a baffled african priest who was invited to celebrate mass together with him .
in spite of the uproar , he emerged unscathed .
catholic journalist zbigniew nosowski , editor of the wiez monthly , said that , once again , the country 's roman catholic bishops could n't agree what to do with the troublesome priest .
" groups that can be called catholic fundamentalists have become stronger in recent years , " said nosowski .
" they have become an important player in the public debate .
radio maryja is a classic example .
it 's a big problem for the polish church to have such a large , organized group within itself .
the church in poland is lacking a vision .

but the problem is n't just on the side of the church .
since the fall of communism , polish politicians have often been accused of forging a tightly knit relationship with the church .
at a recent international conference on poland 's harsh abortion law , human rights campaigner wanda nowicka showed slides of left-wing leaders keen to be photographed next to roman catholic bishops .

more distance needed , critics say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish solidarity movement was closely linked to the catholic church this spells trouble in the long run - not just for the polish political system , but also for the church , according to szymon holownia of the liberal tv channel religia .

" i think we have made some mistakes in this area , where the church became very strongly connected with politics on a social level .
we were creating a new country , a new system , but now everything 's changed , and i think there 's no turning back . "
as radio maryja continues to be the early morning and bedtime listening for millions of poles , politicians who claim to have the backing of the church are free to push their conservative agenda .
this year alone , the polish parliament has passed a law under which pedophiles are to face chemical castration , while the future of ivf treatment in poland is hanging in the balance , with a strong catholic lobby calling for a ban because of what it calls the murder of surplus human embryos produced during the procedure .

but two decades after the collapse of communism , critics say it 's time for the church to distance itself from politics . poland 's newest mobile phone network , w rodzinie , promotes itself as a family-friendly service .
the brand 's name means " all in the family . "
it 's the country 's first network to introduce a phone for seniors , with an extra large display and keys .
according to the commercial , it 's perfect for the granny who just ca n't cope with the complicated digital toys offered by the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : father rydzyk caters to those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
but there 's more to the w rodzinie network than meets the eye .
it advertises on just one tv channel and one radio station - tv trwam and radio maryja - both of which are owned by the controversial roman catholic priest father rydzyk .
w rodzinie is the latest addition to his growing media empire , which broadcasts a hardline message into millions of homes .
his audience is known as the " family of radio maryja , " and is mostly made up of those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
they are a political force to be reckoned with .
grazyna , a teacher in her 50 's , lives in warsaw , but often visits her parents in a village in eastern poland , where she says everyone listens to radio maryja .
fundamentalists gaining influence " people in the countryside are influenced by father rydzyk , because it 's a station that 's available everywhere , " she said .
" when you switch on the radio , it 's the first station that you can find .
he tells them what to do and they follow his instructions .
there 's not much logic in it , so i do n't feel convinced by what they say . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rural areas , radio maryja often is the first station that you can find .
father rydzyk recently provoked intense criticism when he made racist jokes at the expense of a baffled african priest who was invited to celebrate mass together with him .
in spite of the uproar , he emerged unscathed .
catholic journalist zbigniew nosowski , editor of the wiez monthly , said that , once again , the country 's roman catholic bishops could n't agree what to do with the troublesome priest .
" groups that can be called catholic fundamentalists have become stronger in recent years , " said nosowski .
" they have become an important player in the public debate .
radio maryja is a classic example .
it 's a big problem for the polish church to have such a large , organized group within itself .
the church in poland is lacking a vision .
poles got used to the fact that we had strong figures like john paul ii , but now we do n't have such strong personalities . "
but the problem is n't just on the side of the church .
since the fall of communism , polish politicians have often been accused of forging a tightly knit relationship with the church .
at a recent international conference on poland 's harsh abortion law , human rights campaigner wanda nowicka showed slides of left-wing leaders keen to be photographed next to roman catholic bishops .
" that shows you the context in which we are working , " she said .
" even the left , which in theory should be pushing for more liberal legislation , is very much dependent on the church . "
more distance needed , critics say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish solidarity movement was closely linked to the catholic church this spells trouble in the long run - not just for the polish political system , but also for the church , according to szymon holownia of the liberal tv channel religia .
" the church is not the place for political agitation , " he said .
" i think we have made some mistakes in this area , where the church became very strongly connected with politics on a social level .
we were creating a new country , a new system , but now everything 's changed , and i think there 's no turning back . "
as radio maryja continues to be the early morning and bedtime listening for millions of poles , politicians who claim to have the backing of the church are free to push their conservative agenda .
this year alone , the polish parliament has passed a law under which pedophiles are to face chemical castration , while the future of ivf treatment in poland is hanging in the balance , with a strong catholic lobby calling for a ban because of what it calls the murder of surplus human embryos produced during the procedure .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
it is administered by the german association of publishers and booksellers . author : tomas fitzel -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

one has already identified a suspect – while both are looking into who the data was released to . schuelervz , an online forum for german teenagers and high school students , has said it has identified the person it suspects of stealing the data , which include the name , age , school , gender , and photo of thousands of users . " we have taken immediate action to prevent another incident like this one from occurring , " an unnamed spokesperson for the site 's parent company , vz , said . " we have found the person we believe is responsible for the theft , and we are investigating to whom the data was released .
at the moment , the suspect is unwilling to tell us to whom he released the data , " the spokesperson added . schuelervz went on to say that especially protected data – such as email addresses , telephone numbers , photo albums , usernames , and passwords – were not part of the stolen data . awd – a second , more serious run-in with data theft bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data theft is nothing new to founder carsten maschmeyer meanwhile , the names , client numbers , addresses , and telephone numbers of tens of thousands of clients of the german financial service provider awd were hacked into and released on the internet , according to german public broadcaster ndr . in addition to those protected data , contract details including client insurance policies and investments were part of the stolen data . awd , however , said most of the stolen information was outdated .
it said the most recent details were from the year 2001 , with most of the data coming from the mid 90s . " no sensitive data was taken here , that is no data that is considered sensitive under data-protection laws .
in particular , there were no bank account numbers taken , " said an unnamed spokesperson . this is not the first time awd has had to deal with data theft .
in 2007 , the company reported that protected data of several of its trade representatives were stolen and released on the internet .
investigations were suspended , however , after the authorities failed to find any suspects . like in that case , awd has opened an investigation with the local hanover authorities .
in addition , an internal workgroup has been commissioned to help with the investigation . the company said on sunday that it had already notified the clients whose data had been stolen . glb / ap / reuters editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
it is administered by the german association of publishers and booksellers . author : tomas fitzel -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german catholic priest klaus kniffki stands at the end of a long wooden table saying grace . twelve hungry men and women sit with their backs hunched and heads lowered , waiting for their share of bortsch , or beetroot soup .
" the people can take as much as they want - two or three portions - and most of them will .
for many , this is the only meal of the day , " says the 62-year-old priest .
the meal normally costs 2 leu -lrb- about 12 cents -rrb- , but payment is voluntary .
up to 100 needy people come to the soup kitchen every day , according to kniffki .
" hardly anyone pays , " says the priest with just a hint of disappointment .
living on 140 euros per month the young republic of moldova , which gained independence from the disintegrating soviet union on 27 august 1991 , is one of the poorest countries in europe .
the average monthly income per head was around 140 euros in 2008 .
moldova 's countryside provides ample proof of how impoverished the eastern european state really is .
kniffki leaves the village of stauceni and after just a few miles the streets become dusty .
when it rains everything turns into a muddy quagmire , he says .
people have access to electricity but there 's no running water .
at first sight , the front gardens appear idyllic , but these are the sole property of the people who often use the small patches for keeping chickens or a cow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people ca n't pay their way in the soup kitchen kniffki visits an old woman who is tending to her sick son pavel .
the young man used to be a soldier stationed in the russian town of sotchi .
two years after leaving home he was returned to his mother , having lost the power of speech and covered in bedsores .
he spends his days just sitting in his chair without moving and traumatized . his mother always sleeps beside him .
" we have no way of finding out what happened to him .
that will stay his secret .
but we treated all of his wounds , " the priest says , passing his hand gently over pavel 's head .
back at the priests ' house , sister liliana shows photos of other sick people .
once a week , she drives through the villages and seeks out the most severe cases , then bathes patients at the church 's welfare station .
" the people have no sanitation facilities .
they are bedridden .
they can not leave the house , and they are poor , " she says .
battling windmills one-fourth of the country 's four million citizens have already left moldova in search of a better life abroad .
it 's mostly the aged and children that stay behind , the latter often growing up with just one parent .
kniffki , who has lived in the country for 13 years , tries to do as much as he can to help the poor of moldova .
alongside the welfare station and the soup kitchen , the catholic church has also financed a homeless shelter and a nursery school .
but he has n't always found politicians eager to help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with an average income of 140 euros per head , poultry is a welcome backup a couple of years ago , a severe heat wave led to water shortages in the region .
" back then we went to the mayor and asked him to supply water for the children , " the priest recounts .
but instead of help , they got a terse reply : " then close the nursery school . "
last month , moldova ’ s parliament approved a new reformist government which has promised to move the former soviet republic closer to europe .
kniffki said he hopes the new pro-western government will be able to improve the situation in the country .
in the meantime , kniffki will continue to feed the hungry .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .

it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .

in an interview on german public radio , verheugen , a german national , remained optimistic that the deal was on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen says the opel deal is right on track " everyone see the necessity or considers it important to give the company a chance , " he said . under the preliminary deal signed last month , austrian-canadian auto parts maker magna and russian state-owned bank sberbank would take a 55 percent share in opel . ten percent of the company 's shares would be held by the employees while rest would remain with general motors . the sale was formally approved by gm and the opel trust but still faces approval from the eu . clearing the eu hurdle in a letter addressed to german minister of economics karl theodor zu guttenberg on friday , eu competition commissioner neelie kroes objected to what she described as " significant indications " that the financial aid promised by the german government was tied to the choice of a specific buyer for opel .
" such a precondition for the aid would be incompatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- state aid and internal market rules , " the statement said .
kroes said general motors , should be " given the opportunity to reconsider the outcome of the bidding process on the basis of written german assurances that aid would be available " irrespective of the investor .
berlin remains confident deal will pass zu guttenberg reacted by saying he remained confident that the opel deal would not be derailed by the commission 's concerns .
he said there might have been " some confusing statements " from the german government but that those could be cleared up with " the right answers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes has raised questions about berlin 's aid offer kroes further argued that state aid " is meant to tackle problems due to the economic and financial crisis , and can not be used to impose political constraints concerning the location of production activities within the eu . "
other eu member states with opel factories have accused berlin of using the promised financial aid as a lever to limit job cuts at german factories .
magna and sberbank are reportedly planning to slash around 10,500 jobs at european plants .
opel employs more than 50,000 people at plants in austria , belgium , britain , hungary , poland and spain .
the eu commission , which enforces the eu 's competition laws , has the power to block such takeovers .
but its decisions can be challenged in the european court. mz / nk / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair book fair -pipe- 18.10.2009 authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magris spent most of his life living near the iron curtain italian author claudio magris has been awarded the peace prize of the german book trade on sunday .
dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair germany and china meet at the frankfurt book fair book fair -pipe- 18.10.2009 authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magris spent most of his life living near the iron curtain italian author claudio magris has been awarded the peace prize of the german book trade on sunday .
dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

german catholic priest klaus kniffki stands at the end of a long wooden table saying grace . twelve hungry men and women sit with their backs hunched and heads lowered , waiting for their share of bortsch , or beetroot soup .
" the people can take as much as they want - two or three portions - and most of them will .
for many , this is the only meal of the day , " says the 62-year-old priest .
the meal normally costs 2 leu -lrb- about 12 cents -rrb- , but payment is voluntary .
up to 100 needy people come to the soup kitchen every day , according to kniffki .
" hardly anyone pays , " says the priest with just a hint of disappointment .
living on 140 euros per month the young republic of moldova , which gained independence from the disintegrating soviet union on 27 august 1991 , is one of the poorest countries in europe .
the average monthly income per head was around 140 euros in 2008 .
moldova 's countryside provides ample proof of how impoverished the eastern european state really is .
kniffki leaves the village of stauceni and after just a few miles the streets become dusty .

he spends his days just sitting in his chair without moving and traumatized . his mother always sleeps beside him .
" we have no way of finding out what happened to him .
that will stay his secret .

battling windmills one-fourth of the country 's four million citizens have already left moldova in search of a better life abroad .
it 's mostly the aged and children that stay behind , the latter often growing up with just one parent .
kniffki , who has lived in the country for 13 years , tries to do as much as he can to help the poor of moldova .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 18.10.2009 a german priest sets an example in europe 's poor house großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kniffki 's work is often obstructed by uncooperative bureaucrats as moldovans leave their impoverished country , a german priest is determined to make life better for those who decide to stay . it 's lunchtime at the soup kitchen in stauceni - a town only eight kilometers from moldova 's capital , chisinau .
german catholic priest klaus kniffki stands at the end of a long wooden table saying grace . twelve hungry men and women sit with their backs hunched and heads lowered , waiting for their share of bortsch , or beetroot soup .
" the people can take as much as they want - two or three portions - and most of them will .
for many , this is the only meal of the day , " says the 62-year-old priest .
the meal normally costs 2 leu -lrb- about 12 cents -rrb- , but payment is voluntary .
up to 100 needy people come to the soup kitchen every day , according to kniffki .
" hardly anyone pays , " says the priest with just a hint of disappointment .
living on 140 euros per month the young republic of moldova , which gained independence from the disintegrating soviet union on 27 august 1991 , is one of the poorest countries in europe .
the average monthly income per head was around 140 euros in 2008 .
moldova 's countryside provides ample proof of how impoverished the eastern european state really is .
kniffki leaves the village of stauceni and after just a few miles the streets become dusty .
when it rains everything turns into a muddy quagmire , he says .
people have access to electricity but there 's no running water .
at first sight , the front gardens appear idyllic , but these are the sole property of the people who often use the small patches for keeping chickens or a cow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people ca n't pay their way in the soup kitchen kniffki visits an old woman who is tending to her sick son pavel .
the young man used to be a soldier stationed in the russian town of sotchi .
two years after leaving home he was returned to his mother , having lost the power of speech and covered in bedsores .
he spends his days just sitting in his chair without moving and traumatized . his mother always sleeps beside him .
" we have no way of finding out what happened to him .
that will stay his secret .
but we treated all of his wounds , " the priest says , passing his hand gently over pavel 's head .
back at the priests ' house , sister liliana shows photos of other sick people .
once a week , she drives through the villages and seeks out the most severe cases , then bathes patients at the church 's welfare station .
" the people have no sanitation facilities .
they are bedridden .
they can not leave the house , and they are poor , " she says .
battling windmills one-fourth of the country 's four million citizens have already left moldova in search of a better life abroad .
it 's mostly the aged and children that stay behind , the latter often growing up with just one parent .
kniffki , who has lived in the country for 13 years , tries to do as much as he can to help the poor of moldova .
alongside the welfare station and the soup kitchen , the catholic church has also financed a homeless shelter and a nursery school .
but he has n't always found politicians eager to help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with an average income of 140 euros per head , poultry is a welcome backup a couple of years ago , a severe heat wave led to water shortages in the region .
" back then we went to the mayor and asked him to supply water for the children , " the priest recounts .
but instead of help , they got a terse reply : " then close the nursery school . "
last month , moldova ’ s parliament approved a new reformist government which has promised to move the former soviet republic closer to europe .
kniffki said he hopes the new pro-western government will be able to improve the situation in the country .
in the meantime , kniffki will continue to feed the hungry .

dw spoke with the literary giant about war , peace , the cold war and the troubles between china and the west . on sunday , claudio magris receive the peace prize , awarded annually for the efforts of artists and scholars to overcome hatred .
a native of trieste , he is a retired professor of german literature who writes essays and novels .
he had a brief political career as a left alliance senator in rome for trieste from 1994 to 1996 .
his selection in june for the prize brought renewed interest in his philosophical ideas and incisive writing , and revived speculation that he was in line for the nobel prize for literature .
however some german arts commentators criticized the choice , saying his enthusiastic vision of european unity was out of date at a time when many eu citizens are bored with european union politics and nationalism is rampant again .
deutsche welle : claudio magris , this weekend you 'll be awarded the 2009 peace prize at the frankfurt book fair , let 's talk about peace and war .
war plays a big role in your works .
do we have to accept war as a part of our lives ?
claudio magris : no .
of course there are different kinds of war , not just war where bombs are dropped .
there are wars in everyday life – latent wars .
there are two dangers .
firstly , that people think that war is unavoidable , that it 's part of life .
on the other hand , the false optimism that people think that in our world progress has eliminated wars like immunization has eliminated smallpox .
this is a danger , because to fight a disease – and war is a disease – you have to know the disease .
you also have to unfortunately be aware of how serious it is and how probable it is that another war will break out .
you 've mentioned different types of wars , the cold war , for instance .
in europe we 're celebrating the 20 th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the cold war .
you come from trieste , one of the places where east met west .
you were on the border during the cold war .
how did you experience the end of communism and how europe grew together ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 magris was awarded the walter hallstein preis for his work in fostering european integration first of all it was a big surprise for all of us .
nobody could believe in september 1989 that the berlin wall would fall so quickly .
i could n't have imagined it .
even people who were active in bringing down the wall , i talked with some of them , and right up until the day before they never believed that the wall would fall .
and they were fighting for this to happen .
this is a danger that we blindly believe .
we believe that the reality and the situation we are currently in today can never change .
this border that was impregnable up until the end – the iron curtain – was close to my house .
i lived in the center of trieste , but it 's a small city , so i always felt that someone in spirit i was on the other side of the border .
not on a political level , but because these regions were divided for absurd reasons .
today we have other barriers ; invisible , social barriers .
ethnic barriers within our towns that we ca n't or do n't want to see .
so the borders are still there .
you 're an author , a storyteller , an essay writer , a journalist , and you were also a politician in a left-wing alliance in the italian senate .
what is the role of the author today ?
are they public personalities ?
someone who explains the ways of the world ?
no , an author is just like any person who fights for his values – with his own weapon , of course .
i do n't think an author has to necessarily know everything better than others .
we must not forget that many of the greatest authors of the last century , who we have loved and learned from , made terrible mistakes .
not even writing a masterpiece is enough to guarantee that you wo n't do something stupid five minutes later .
authors are not some kind of priest who knows better than everyone else .
these are people who fight for their values and their obligations and they should do this with the means that are available to them .
what does an author do in berlusconi 's italy ?
this seems to be an almost permanent situation .
from the outside it looks as if the artists and intellectuals have resigned themselves to the scandals and absurdity in italy .
no , they are not resigned to it , not at all .
the polemic is very strong .
i 've been an example of that , recently .
you have to ask the question why has that been possible and why is that still possible ?
and we – and by we i mean the opposition that is against what i see as a completely unbelievable and unthinkable way of governing a country – have failed to understand how society , or a part of society , has changed .
it was easy to hate a man like berlusconi or trivialize him .
you have to know a disease to fight it and i view this kind of politics as a disease .
let 's go from italy to china .
there has been a huge dispute here at the book fair .
china is the guest nation and there has been heated debate about human rights and censorship , authors who could n't come and authors in exile .
do you think it was right to invite china in an official way to the frankfurt book fair ?
i 've asked myself this question a lot .
the problem is not to focus on one dissident or another that was n't allowed to come .
that in itself is unacceptable .
but i believe that despite everything , it was n't bad to invite china .
not just to get to know them better , but also to go further with dialog .
i do n't think this weakens the dissidents .

but two decades after the collapse of communism , critics say it 's time for the church to distance itself from politics . poland 's newest mobile phone network , w rodzinie , promotes itself as a family-friendly service .
the brand 's name means " all in the family . "
it 's the country 's first network to introduce a phone for seniors , with an extra large display and keys .
according to the commercial , it 's perfect for the granny who just ca n't cope with the complicated digital toys offered by the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : father rydzyk caters to those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
but there 's more to the w rodzinie network than meets the eye .
it advertises on just one tv channel and one radio station - tv trwam and radio maryja - both of which are owned by the controversial roman catholic priest father rydzyk .
w rodzinie is the latest addition to his growing media empire , which broadcasts a hardline message into millions of homes .
his audience is known as the " family of radio maryja , " and is mostly made up of those who feel left behind by poland 's fast-paced market reforms .
they are a political force to be reckoned with .
grazyna , a teacher in her 50 's , lives in warsaw , but often visits her parents in a village in eastern poland , where she says everyone listens to radio maryja .
fundamentalists gaining influence " people in the countryside are influenced by father rydzyk , because it 's a station that 's available everywhere , " she said .
" when you switch on the radio , it 's the first station that you can find .
he tells them what to do and they follow his instructions .
there 's not much logic in it , so i do n't feel convinced by what they say . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rural areas , radio maryja often is the first station that you can find .
father rydzyk recently provoked intense criticism when he made racist jokes at the expense of a baffled african priest who was invited to celebrate mass together with him .
in spite of the uproar , he emerged unscathed .
catholic journalist zbigniew nosowski , editor of the wiez monthly , said that , once again , the country 's roman catholic bishops could n't agree what to do with the troublesome priest .
" groups that can be called catholic fundamentalists have become stronger in recent years , " said nosowski .
" they have become an important player in the public debate .
radio maryja is a classic example .
it 's a big problem for the polish church to have such a large , organized group within itself .
the church in poland is lacking a vision .
poles got used to the fact that we had strong figures like john paul ii , but now we do n't have such strong personalities . "
but the problem is n't just on the side of the church .
since the fall of communism , polish politicians have often been accused of forging a tightly knit relationship with the church .
at a recent international conference on poland 's harsh abortion law , human rights campaigner wanda nowicka showed slides of left-wing leaders keen to be photographed next to roman catholic bishops .
" that shows you the context in which we are working , " she said .
" even the left , which in theory should be pushing for more liberal legislation , is very much dependent on the church . "
more distance needed , critics say bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish solidarity movement was closely linked to the catholic church this spells trouble in the long run - not just for the polish political system , but also for the church , according to szymon holownia of the liberal tv channel religia .
" the church is not the place for political agitation , " he said .
" i think we have made some mistakes in this area , where the church became very strongly connected with politics on a social level .
we were creating a new country , a new system , but now everything 's changed , and i think there 's no turning back . "
as radio maryja continues to be the early morning and bedtime listening for millions of poles , politicians who claim to have the backing of the church are free to push their conservative agenda .
this year alone , the polish parliament has passed a law under which pedophiles are to face chemical castration , while the future of ivf treatment in poland is hanging in the balance , with a strong catholic lobby calling for a ban because of what it calls the murder of surplus human embryos produced during the procedure .

in an interview on german public radio , verheugen , a german national , remained optimistic that the deal was on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen says the opel deal is right on track " everyone see the necessity or considers it important to give the company a chance , " he said . under the preliminary deal signed last month , austrian-canadian auto parts maker magna and russian state-owned bank sberbank would take a 55 percent share in opel . ten percent of the company 's shares would be held by the employees while rest would remain with general motors . the sale was formally approved by gm and the opel trust but still faces approval from the eu . clearing the eu hurdle in a letter addressed to german minister of economics karl theodor zu guttenberg on friday , eu competition commissioner neelie kroes objected to what she described as " significant indications " that the financial aid promised by the german government was tied to the choice of a specific buyer for opel .
" such a precondition for the aid would be incompatible with -lrb- eu -rrb- state aid and internal market rules , " the statement said .
kroes said general motors , should be " given the opportunity to reconsider the outcome of the bidding process on the basis of written german assurances that aid would be available " irrespective of the investor .
berlin remains confident deal will pass zu guttenberg reacted by saying he remained confident that the opel deal would not be derailed by the commission 's concerns .
he said there might have been " some confusing statements " from the german government but that those could be cleared up with " the right answers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes has raised questions about berlin 's aid offer kroes further argued that state aid " is meant to tackle problems due to the economic and financial crisis , and can not be used to impose political constraints concerning the location of production activities within the eu . "
other eu member states with opel factories have accused berlin of using the promised financial aid as a lever to limit job cuts at german factories .
magna and sberbank are reportedly planning to slash around 10,500 jobs at european plants .
opel employs more than 50,000 people at plants in austria , belgium , britain , hungary , poland and spain .
the eu commission , which enforces the eu 's competition laws , has the power to block such takeovers .
but its decisions can be challenged in the european court. mz / nk / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

70-year-old magris became well-known in 1986 for his book " danube : a sentimental journey from the source to the black sea " , in which he analyzes the culture and conflicts of central europe .
his writing has always focused on the problems that arise from different cultures and ethnic groups living together . born in the italian town of trieste , many of magris ' books deal with the old austro-hungarian empire , which his hometown once was a part of .
his own family history reflects the multicultural tapestry of this region and the interlocking cultures on the north and south slopes of the alps " my grandfather came to trieste from a village at the end of the 19th century , and my mother was from dalmatia and of greek-venetian heritage , " said magris .
" and we have croatian cousins . " inspired by experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trieste is a melting pot of central european cultures rising nationalism in the early 20th century often tore families in this region apart .
one side chose italy ; the other croatia .
and , just like berlin , trieste was divided into separate administrative zones after world war ii . this meant that a region of mixed languages , dialects , cultures and ethnicities suddenly became a place divided by borders .
it brought a certain sense of melancholy to the town , and a hint of this melancholy can still be seen in magris when he sits in one of the local cafes writing his books . magris ' wife , writer marisa madieri , died over ten years ago .
she was his travel companion and the first reader and editor of his work , keen on simplifying his occasionally convoluted writing .
today , when magris speaks about the loss of utopia as one of his key literary topics it is partly a reflection of his own personal experience . the awards is given each year as part of the frankfurt book fair .
endowed with 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,000 -rrb- , the prize was introduced in 1950 , and usually goes to writers or scholars whose work improves understanding between rival nations and ethnic groups .
it is administered by the german association of publishers and booksellers . author : tomas fitzel -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the department of health wants all adults in england to be given the money to manage and pay for their own care by 2011 .
but public sector union unison says this strategy will put some people at risk of abuse and exploitation .
health officials insists the system offers choice which can transform people 's lives .
' minefield ' personal budgets are a new way of administering social care which builds on the previous direct payments scheme .
this allows people to claim the cost of their care as cash , instead of receiving the care from their local authority .
the government wants all users of social care in england to have personal budgets by 2011 .
for many , this will mean they are responsible for employing their own care staff . "
whilst the new system will work really well for some people , others need good reliable care , not cash " unison individuals will have the right to opt out of the system , but local authorities are encouraging take-up .
similar schemes exist in scotland , northern ireland and wales .
however , campaigners have told the bbc they are concerned about the impact of expanding the direct payments model .
a recent survey from unison , the uk 's largest public sector union , found that 62 % of social workers polled believe the roll-out of " cash for care " will undo a lot of the progress made towards protecting vulnerable adults .
" whilst the new system will work really well for some people , others need good reliable care , not cash , " unison 's helga pile warned .
she worries about those left to negotiate " the minefield " of becoming an employer on their own .
" social workers fear this will result in an increase in the number of safeguarding vulnerable adult cases - or a ' granny p ' tragedy waiting to happen . "
' indispensible ' irene simons shares those fears - she was one of the first recipients of direct payments in 1997 .
instead of getting the council to provide carers , she opted to get the cash and arrange them herself but she had no idea what she was getting herself into .
" this person rang me up and said she 'd heard i was getting direct payments , and that she 'd come and work for me .
i took her on because i did n't know what it would mean , " she told radio 5 live 's donal macintyre programme .

choice the exploitation was only uncovered when irene 's sister jennifer moved back to the area .
she believes birmingham city council should have managed the care directly .
she said : " do n't just give somebody the money to hire their own carers .
if that person is not capable , then the council needs to give somebody that job . "
birmingham city council says its systems have improved since irene simons ' case came to light .

according to a 2008 survey conducted by the magazine community care , less than half of those receiving direct payments did proper vetting of those they hired .

the department of health told radio 5 live that it has issued guidance to local authorities on how to assess if there is a risk to the person opting for direct payments , and insists that safety concerns are important .

but public sector union unison says this strategy will put some people at risk of abuse and exploitation .
health officials insists the system offers choice which can transform people 's lives .

this allows people to claim the cost of their care as cash , instead of receiving the care from their local authority .
the government wants all users of social care in england to have personal budgets by 2011 .
for many , this will mean they are responsible for employing their own care staff .

similar schemes exist in scotland , northern ireland and wales .

" this person rang me up and said she 'd heard i was getting direct payments , and that she 'd come and work for me .
i took her on because i did n't know what it would mean , " she told radio 5 live 's donal macintyre programme .
helen bailey quickly became indispensable , looking after the severely-disabled woman 's every need .
safeguarding people in vulnerable situations remains a priority department of health spokesman but she also remortgaged her client 's house after forging her signature , and stole thousands more by falsely claiming her husband shared caring duties .
