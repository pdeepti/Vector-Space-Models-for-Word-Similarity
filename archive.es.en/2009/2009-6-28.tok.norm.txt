currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .
the only exception is for children born in germany after 1990 to parents from eu member states . germany 's large turkish community is the group most affected by the current system .
dual citizenship a loyalty problem ?
kenan kolat , head of the turkish community , is a supporter of the campaign . " the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .
marieluise beck of the green party says that forcing foreigners ' children to choose a nationality creates a sense of mistrust between the state and children of migrants .
it is also a very emotional decision for many people .
dieter wiefel-spütz , the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , told the " frankfurter rundschau " newspaper that , " the so-called ' options model ' is a bureaucratic monster which tortures people . "

the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .
the czech parliament approved the eu 's lisbon treaty earlier this year , though the eurosceptic czech president vaclav klaus is so far refusing to put his signature to ratification .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will welcome sweden 's reign others say it is too early to make any judgments , as several issues taken up under the czech presidency will not lead to concrete results for some time , if ever .
these include guarantees for ireland over the lisbon treaty , the eastern partnership project , and plans for the nabucco gas pipeline .
" whether they might overshadow the negative experience with the fall of the government will depend on the success of those particular projects , which the czech presidency was supporting , " says ivo slosarcik of the think-tank europeum .
perhaps history will after all be kinder to the czech eu presidency than present day commentators .
for now , many in europe will be somewhat relieved when the swedes take the helm on july 1 .

after three decades of conflict , it 's another step forward for diplomacy . two of northern ireland 's biggest loyalist paramilitary groups , the ulster volunteer force -lrb- uvf -rrb- and the red hand commando -lrb- rhc -rrb- , say they have destroyed their weapons , and have promised to respect local laws .
another group , the ulster defence association -lrb- uda -rrb- , said it has started destroying its weapons , too .
" the dark days are now behind us and it is time to move on , " the uda said in a statement .
" there is no place for guns and violence in the new society we are building .
it is time to work for a better future . "
the groups , which advocate northern ireland remaining a part of britain , are responsible for almost 1,000 murders of mainly catholics during the bloody 30-year conflict between catholics and protestants in the region .

27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives ' re-election campaign motto reads " we have the power " delegates from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , agreed that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign and should be introduced at some point during the next legislative term . the two parties , however , failed to agree on a date for the cuts , to the dismay of the csu , which wanted to see the measures introduced by 2011 . the chancellor flatly rejected calls to increase germany 's sales taxes to offset income-tax cuts . " i will not increase value-added tax in the life of the next parliament , " she said bluntly after the meeting .
" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts . " merkel loyalists slapped down calls from two state premiers , guenther oettinger of baden wuerttemberg and wolfgang boehmer of saxony-anhalt , to frankly tell the public about sacrifices needed to finance any tax cuts . sitting pretty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some conservatives wanted to increase sales tax on items that currently enjoy reduced rates bavarian premier and csu chairman horst seehofer praised merkel as an " excellent chancellor " and said his party would throw its full support behind her re-election .
if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the minority party in germany 's grand coalition government , hope to be able to hold on to power .
but its dreams of forming a governing coalition with the greens seem very distant , with the two parties currently polling 24 and 15 percent of the votes respectively .
confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .
the opposition greens also called the program a grab bag of policies .
the fdp said their potential allies had laid out a mix of goods on the table , but were holding back on the prices , while the left party called the tax cuts implausible. nw / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives ' re-election campaign motto reads " we have the power " delegates from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , agreed that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign and should be introduced at some point during the next legislative term . the two parties , however , failed to agree on a date for the cuts , to the dismay of the csu , which wanted to see the measures introduced by 2011 . the chancellor flatly rejected calls to increase germany 's sales taxes to offset income-tax cuts . " i will not increase value-added tax in the life of the next parliament , " she said bluntly after the meeting .
" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts . " merkel loyalists slapped down calls from two state premiers , guenther oettinger of baden wuerttemberg and wolfgang boehmer of saxony-anhalt , to frankly tell the public about sacrifices needed to finance any tax cuts . sitting pretty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some conservatives wanted to increase sales tax on items that currently enjoy reduced rates bavarian premier and csu chairman horst seehofer praised merkel as an " excellent chancellor " and said his party would throw its full support behind her re-election .
if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the minority party in germany 's grand coalition government , hope to be able to hold on to power .
but its dreams of forming a governing coalition with the greens seem very distant , with the two parties currently polling 24 and 15 percent of the votes respectively .
confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .
the opposition greens also called the program a grab bag of policies .
the fdp said their potential allies had laid out a mix of goods on the table , but were holding back on the prices , while the left party called the tax cuts implausible. nw / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .
the czech parliament approved the eu 's lisbon treaty earlier this year , though the eurosceptic czech president vaclav klaus is so far refusing to put his signature to ratification .
jury still out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will welcome sweden 's reign others say it is too early to make any judgments , as several issues taken up under the czech presidency will not lead to concrete results for some time , if ever .
these include guarantees for ireland over the lisbon treaty , the eastern partnership project , and plans for the nabucco gas pipeline .
" whether they might overshadow the negative experience with the fall of the government will depend on the success of those particular projects , which the czech presidency was supporting , " says ivo slosarcik of the think-tank europeum .
perhaps history will after all be kinder to the czech eu presidency than present day commentators .
for now , many in europe will be somewhat relieved when the swedes take the helm on july 1 .

" i will not increase value-added tax in the life of the next parliament , " she said bluntly after the meeting .
" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts . " merkel loyalists slapped down calls from two state premiers , guenther oettinger of baden wuerttemberg and wolfgang boehmer of saxony-anhalt , to frankly tell the public about sacrifices needed to finance any tax cuts . sitting pretty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some conservatives wanted to increase sales tax on items that currently enjoy reduced rates bavarian premier and csu chairman horst seehofer praised merkel as an " excellent chancellor " and said his party would throw its full support behind her re-election .
if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the minority party in germany 's grand coalition government , hope to be able to hold on to power .
but its dreams of forming a governing coalition with the greens seem very distant , with the two parties currently polling 24 and 15 percent of the votes respectively .
confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .

the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .
the only exception is for children born in germany after 1990 to parents from eu member states . germany 's large turkish community is the group most affected by the current system .
dual citizenship a loyalty problem ?
kenan kolat , head of the turkish community , is a supporter of the campaign . " the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .
marieluise beck of the green party says that forcing foreigners ' children to choose a nationality creates a sense of mistrust between the state and children of migrants .
it is also a very emotional decision for many people .
dieter wiefel-spütz , the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , told the " frankfurter rundschau " newspaper that , " the so-called ' options model ' is a bureaucratic monster which tortures people . "
this year around 3,900 young people with dual nationality in germany will have to make their decision on whether to remain german or to become a foreigner. vj / epd / dpa / frankfurter rundschau editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .
the only exception is for children born in germany after 1990 to parents from eu member states . germany 's large turkish community is the group most affected by the current system .
dual citizenship a loyalty problem ?
kenan kolat , head of the turkish community , is a supporter of the campaign . " the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .
marieluise beck of the green party says that forcing foreigners ' children to choose a nationality creates a sense of mistrust between the state and children of migrants .
it is also a very emotional decision for many people .
dieter wiefel-spütz , the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , told the " frankfurter rundschau " newspaper that , " the so-called ' options model ' is a bureaucratic monster which tortures people . "

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .
the only exception is for children born in germany after 1990 to parents from eu member states . germany 's large turkish community is the group most affected by the current system .
dual citizenship a loyalty problem ?
kenan kolat , head of the turkish community , is a supporter of the campaign . " the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .
marieluise beck of the green party says that forcing foreigners ' children to choose a nationality creates a sense of mistrust between the state and children of migrants .
it is also a very emotional decision for many people .
dieter wiefel-spütz , the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , told the " frankfurter rundschau " newspaper that , " the so-called ' options model ' is a bureaucratic monster which tortures people . "

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .
the only exception is for children born in germany after 1990 to parents from eu member states . germany 's large turkish community is the group most affected by the current system .
dual citizenship a loyalty problem ?
kenan kolat , head of the turkish community , is a supporter of the campaign . " the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .
marieluise beck of the green party says that forcing foreigners ' children to choose a nationality creates a sense of mistrust between the state and children of migrants .
it is also a very emotional decision for many people .
dieter wiefel-spütz , the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , told the " frankfurter rundschau " newspaper that , " the so-called ' options model ' is a bureaucratic monster which tortures people . "

" an initial ransom demand was made for $ 8 million -lsb- 5,7 million euros -rsb- , " said interior minister guido de padt .
" after 68 days of negotiations , an agreement was reached on wednesday , thanks to the mediation of a somali intermediary , who went on board the ship several times .

the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .
the czech parliament approved the eu 's lisbon treaty earlier this year , though the eurosceptic czech president vaclav klaus is so far refusing to put his signature to ratification .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will welcome sweden 's reign others say it is too early to make any judgments , as several issues taken up under the czech presidency will not lead to concrete results for some time , if ever .
these include guarantees for ireland over the lisbon treaty , the eastern partnership project , and plans for the nabucco gas pipeline .
" whether they might overshadow the negative experience with the fall of the government will depend on the success of those particular projects , which the czech presidency was supporting , " says ivo slosarcik of the think-tank europeum .
perhaps history will after all be kinder to the czech eu presidency than present day commentators .
for now , many in europe will be somewhat relieved when the swedes take the helm on july 1 .

the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .
the czech parliament approved the eu 's lisbon treaty earlier this year , though the eurosceptic czech president vaclav klaus is so far refusing to put his signature to ratification .
jury still out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will welcome sweden 's reign others say it is too early to make any judgments , as several issues taken up under the czech presidency will not lead to concrete results for some time , if ever .
these include guarantees for ireland over the lisbon treaty , the eastern partnership project , and plans for the nabucco gas pipeline .
" whether they might overshadow the negative experience with the fall of the government will depend on the success of those particular projects , which the czech presidency was supporting , " says ivo slosarcik of the think-tank europeum .
perhaps history will after all be kinder to the czech eu presidency than present day commentators .
for now , many in europe will be somewhat relieved when the swedes take the helm on july 1 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.06.2009 german conservatives settle on tax cuts as key campaign issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the conservatives win , there will be no sales tax hikes by promising tax cuts in their campaign program for september 's elections , german conservatives hope to restore their popular leader angela merkel to power , but also to ditch their social democratic coalition partners . conservative leaders voted unanimously on sunday , june 28 , in favor of a program of moderate tax cuts and income relief for middle-class families . with the german economy facing the prospect of shrinking by six percent this year , it 's no secret that economic concerns will likely dominate the run-up to the elections on sept .
27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives ' re-election campaign motto reads " we have the power " delegates from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , agreed that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign and should be introduced at some point during the next legislative term . the two parties , however , failed to agree on a date for the cuts , to the dismay of the csu , which wanted to see the measures introduced by 2011 . the chancellor flatly rejected calls to increase germany 's sales taxes to offset income-tax cuts . " i will not increase value-added tax in the life of the next parliament , " she said bluntly after the meeting .
" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts . " merkel loyalists slapped down calls from two state premiers , guenther oettinger of baden wuerttemberg and wolfgang boehmer of saxony-anhalt , to frankly tell the public about sacrifices needed to finance any tax cuts . sitting pretty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some conservatives wanted to increase sales tax on items that currently enjoy reduced rates bavarian premier and csu chairman horst seehofer praised merkel as an " excellent chancellor " and said his party would throw its full support behind her re-election .
if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the minority party in germany 's grand coalition government , hope to be able to hold on to power .
but its dreams of forming a governing coalition with the greens seem very distant , with the two parties currently polling 24 and 15 percent of the votes respectively .
confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .
the opposition greens also called the program a grab bag of policies .
the fdp said their potential allies had laid out a mix of goods on the table , but were holding back on the prices , while the left party called the tax cuts implausible. nw / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .
the czech parliament approved the eu 's lisbon treaty earlier this year , though the eurosceptic czech president vaclav klaus is so far refusing to put his signature to ratification .
jury still out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will welcome sweden 's reign others say it is too early to make any judgments , as several issues taken up under the czech presidency will not lead to concrete results for some time , if ever .
these include guarantees for ireland over the lisbon treaty , the eastern partnership project , and plans for the nabucco gas pipeline .
" whether they might overshadow the negative experience with the fall of the government will depend on the success of those particular projects , which the czech presidency was supporting , " says ivo slosarcik of the think-tank europeum .
perhaps history will after all be kinder to the czech eu presidency than present day commentators .
for now , many in europe will be somewhat relieved when the swedes take the helm on july 1 .

after three decades of conflict , it 's another step forward for diplomacy . two of northern ireland 's biggest loyalist paramilitary groups , the ulster volunteer force -lrb- uvf -rrb- and the red hand commando -lrb- rhc -rrb- , say they have destroyed their weapons , and have promised to respect local laws .
another group , the ulster defence association -lrb- uda -rrb- , said it has started destroying its weapons , too .
" the dark days are now behind us and it is time to move on , " the uda said in a statement .
" there is no place for guns and violence in the new society we are building .
it is time to work for a better future . "
the groups , which advocate northern ireland remaining a part of britain , are responsible for almost 1,000 murders of mainly catholics during the bloody 30-year conflict between catholics and protestants in the region .

" all parties agree , as the people of northern ireland do , that the only way forward is through peace and reconciliation , and not through violence , " clinton said . among the local groups to welcome the news were britain 's ministers for northern ireland affairs , the largely irish catholic pro-independence party sinn fein , catholic leader cardinal sean brady and irish president mary mcaleese. msh / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .

" the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .

the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .
the czech parliament approved the eu 's lisbon treaty earlier this year , though the eurosceptic czech president vaclav klaus is so far refusing to put his signature to ratification .
jury still out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will welcome sweden 's reign others say it is too early to make any judgments , as several issues taken up under the czech presidency will not lead to concrete results for some time , if ever .
these include guarantees for ireland over the lisbon treaty , the eastern partnership project , and plans for the nabucco gas pipeline .
" whether they might overshadow the negative experience with the fall of the government will depend on the success of those particular projects , which the czech presidency was supporting , " says ivo slosarcik of the think-tank europeum .
perhaps history will after all be kinder to the czech eu presidency than present day commentators .
for now , many in europe will be somewhat relieved when the swedes take the helm on july 1 .

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .
the only exception is for children born in germany after 1990 to parents from eu member states . germany 's large turkish community is the group most affected by the current system .
dual citizenship a loyalty problem ?
kenan kolat , head of the turkish community , is a supporter of the campaign . " the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .
marieluise beck of the green party says that forcing foreigners ' children to choose a nationality creates a sense of mistrust between the state and children of migrants .
it is also a very emotional decision for many people .
dieter wiefel-spütz , the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , told the " frankfurter rundschau " newspaper that , " the so-called ' options model ' is a bureaucratic monster which tortures people . "

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .
the only exception is for children born in germany after 1990 to parents from eu member states . germany 's large turkish community is the group most affected by the current system .
dual citizenship a loyalty problem ?
kenan kolat , head of the turkish community , is a supporter of the campaign . " the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .
marieluise beck of the green party says that forcing foreigners ' children to choose a nationality creates a sense of mistrust between the state and children of migrants .
it is also a very emotional decision for many people .
dieter wiefel-spütz , the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , told the " frankfurter rundschau " newspaper that , " the so-called ' options model ' is a bureaucratic monster which tortures people . "
this year around 3,900 young people with dual nationality in germany will have to make their decision on whether to remain german or to become a foreigner. vj / epd / dpa / frankfurter rundschau editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 28.06.2009 ill-fated czech presidency of eu draws to a close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech 's have nearly finished their six-month eu presidency the czech republic 's presidency of the european union , which ends on tuesday , will not be remembered as a success .
the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .
the czech parliament approved the eu 's lisbon treaty earlier this year , though the eurosceptic czech president vaclav klaus is so far refusing to put his signature to ratification .
jury still out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will welcome sweden 's reign others say it is too early to make any judgments , as several issues taken up under the czech presidency will not lead to concrete results for some time , if ever .
these include guarantees for ireland over the lisbon treaty , the eastern partnership project , and plans for the nabucco gas pipeline .
" whether they might overshadow the negative experience with the fall of the government will depend on the success of those particular projects , which the czech presidency was supporting , " says ivo slosarcik of the think-tank europeum .
perhaps history will after all be kinder to the czech eu presidency than present day commentators .
for now , many in europe will be somewhat relieved when the swedes take the helm on july 1 .

27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives ' re-election campaign motto reads " we have the power " delegates from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , agreed that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign and should be introduced at some point during the next legislative term . the two parties , however , failed to agree on a date for the cuts , to the dismay of the csu , which wanted to see the measures introduced by 2011 . the chancellor flatly rejected calls to increase germany 's sales taxes to offset income-tax cuts . " i will not increase value-added tax in the life of the next parliament , " she said bluntly after the meeting .
" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts . " merkel loyalists slapped down calls from two state premiers , guenther oettinger of baden wuerttemberg and wolfgang boehmer of saxony-anhalt , to frankly tell the public about sacrifices needed to finance any tax cuts . sitting pretty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some conservatives wanted to increase sales tax on items that currently enjoy reduced rates bavarian premier and csu chairman horst seehofer praised merkel as an " excellent chancellor " and said his party would throw its full support behind her re-election .
if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the minority party in germany 's grand coalition government , hope to be able to hold on to power .
but its dreams of forming a governing coalition with the greens seem very distant , with the two parties currently polling 24 and 15 percent of the votes respectively .
confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .
the opposition greens also called the program a grab bag of policies .
the fdp said their potential allies had laid out a mix of goods on the table , but were holding back on the prices , while the left party called the tax cuts implausible. nw / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will not increase value-added tax in the life of the next parliament , " she said bluntly after the meeting .
" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts .

if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the minority party in germany 's grand coalition government , hope to be able to hold on to power .

the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .
the only exception is for children born in germany after 1990 to parents from eu member states . germany 's large turkish community is the group most affected by the current system .
dual citizenship a loyalty problem ?
kenan kolat , head of the turkish community , is a supporter of the campaign . " the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .
marieluise beck of the green party says that forcing foreigners ' children to choose a nationality creates a sense of mistrust between the state and children of migrants .
it is also a very emotional decision for many people .
dieter wiefel-spütz , the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , told the " frankfurter rundschau " newspaper that , " the so-called ' options model ' is a bureaucratic monster which tortures people . "
this year around 3,900 young people with dual nationality in germany will have to make their decision on whether to remain german or to become a foreigner. vj / epd / dpa / frankfurter rundschau editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives ' re-election campaign motto reads " we have the power " delegates from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , agreed that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign and should be introduced at some point during the next legislative term . the two parties , however , failed to agree on a date for the cuts , to the dismay of the csu , which wanted to see the measures introduced by 2011 . the chancellor flatly rejected calls to increase germany 's sales taxes to offset income-tax cuts . " i will not increase value-added tax in the life of the next parliament , " she said bluntly after the meeting .
" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts . " merkel loyalists slapped down calls from two state premiers , guenther oettinger of baden wuerttemberg and wolfgang boehmer of saxony-anhalt , to frankly tell the public about sacrifices needed to finance any tax cuts . sitting pretty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some conservatives wanted to increase sales tax on items that currently enjoy reduced rates bavarian premier and csu chairman horst seehofer praised merkel as an " excellent chancellor " and said his party would throw its full support behind her re-election .
if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the minority party in germany 's grand coalition government , hope to be able to hold on to power .
but its dreams of forming a governing coalition with the greens seem very distant , with the two parties currently polling 24 and 15 percent of the votes respectively .
confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .
the opposition greens also called the program a grab bag of policies .
the fdp said their potential allies had laid out a mix of goods on the table , but were holding back on the prices , while the left party called the tax cuts implausible. nw / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .
the only exception is for children born in germany after 1990 to parents from eu member states . germany 's large turkish community is the group most affected by the current system .

kenan kolat , head of the turkish community , is a supporter of the campaign . " the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .
marieluise beck of the green party says that forcing foreigners ' children to choose a nationality creates a sense of mistrust between the state and children of migrants .
it is also a very emotional decision for many people .
dieter wiefel-spütz , the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , told the " frankfurter rundschau " newspaper that , " the so-called ' options model ' is a bureaucratic monster which tortures people . "

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 28.06.2009 ill-fated czech presidency of eu draws to a close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech 's have nearly finished their six-month eu presidency the czech republic 's presidency of the european union , which ends on tuesday , will not be remembered as a success .
the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .
the czech parliament approved the eu 's lisbon treaty earlier this year , though the eurosceptic czech president vaclav klaus is so far refusing to put his signature to ratification .
jury still out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will welcome sweden 's reign others say it is too early to make any judgments , as several issues taken up under the czech presidency will not lead to concrete results for some time , if ever .
these include guarantees for ireland over the lisbon treaty , the eastern partnership project , and plans for the nabucco gas pipeline .
" whether they might overshadow the negative experience with the fall of the government will depend on the success of those particular projects , which the czech presidency was supporting , " says ivo slosarcik of the think-tank europeum .
perhaps history will after all be kinder to the czech eu presidency than present day commentators .
for now , many in europe will be somewhat relieved when the swedes take the helm on july 1 .

the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .
the czech parliament approved the eu 's lisbon treaty earlier this year , though the eurosceptic czech president vaclav klaus is so far refusing to put his signature to ratification .
jury still out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will welcome sweden 's reign others say it is too early to make any judgments , as several issues taken up under the czech presidency will not lead to concrete results for some time , if ever .
these include guarantees for ireland over the lisbon treaty , the eastern partnership project , and plans for the nabucco gas pipeline .
" whether they might overshadow the negative experience with the fall of the government will depend on the success of those particular projects , which the czech presidency was supporting , " says ivo slosarcik of the think-tank europeum .
perhaps history will after all be kinder to the czech eu presidency than present day commentators .
for now , many in europe will be somewhat relieved when the swedes take the helm on july 1 .

" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts .

if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the minority party in germany 's grand coalition government , hope to be able to hold on to power .

confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .
the opposition greens also called the program a grab bag of policies .

after three decades of conflict , it 's another step forward for diplomacy . two of northern ireland 's biggest loyalist paramilitary groups , the ulster volunteer force -lrb- uvf -rrb- and the red hand commando -lrb- rhc -rrb- , say they have destroyed their weapons , and have promised to respect local laws .
another group , the ulster defence association -lrb- uda -rrb- , said it has started destroying its weapons , too .
" the dark days are now behind us and it is time to move on , " the uda said in a statement .
" there is no place for guns and violence in the new society we are building .
it is time to work for a better future . "
the groups , which advocate northern ireland remaining a part of britain , are responsible for almost 1,000 murders of mainly catholics during the bloody 30-year conflict between catholics and protestants in the region .

" all parties agree , as the people of northern ireland do , that the only way forward is through peace and reconciliation , and not through violence , " clinton said . among the local groups to welcome the news were britain 's ministers for northern ireland affairs , the largely irish catholic pro-independence party sinn fein , catholic leader cardinal sean brady and irish president mary mcaleese. msh / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.06.2009 german conservatives settle on tax cuts as key campaign issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the conservatives win , there will be no sales tax hikes by promising tax cuts in their campaign program for september 's elections , german conservatives hope to restore their popular leader angela merkel to power , but also to ditch their social democratic coalition partners . conservative leaders voted unanimously on sunday , june 28 , in favor of a program of moderate tax cuts and income relief for middle-class families . with the german economy facing the prospect of shrinking by six percent this year , it 's no secret that economic concerns will likely dominate the run-up to the elections on sept .
27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives ' re-election campaign motto reads " we have the power " delegates from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , agreed that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign and should be introduced at some point during the next legislative term . the two parties , however , failed to agree on a date for the cuts , to the dismay of the csu , which wanted to see the measures introduced by 2011 . the chancellor flatly rejected calls to increase germany 's sales taxes to offset income-tax cuts . " i will not increase value-added tax in the life of the next parliament , " she said bluntly after the meeting .
" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts . " merkel loyalists slapped down calls from two state premiers , guenther oettinger of baden wuerttemberg and wolfgang boehmer of saxony-anhalt , to frankly tell the public about sacrifices needed to finance any tax cuts . sitting pretty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some conservatives wanted to increase sales tax on items that currently enjoy reduced rates bavarian premier and csu chairman horst seehofer praised merkel as an " excellent chancellor " and said his party would throw its full support behind her re-election .
if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the minority party in germany 's grand coalition government , hope to be able to hold on to power .
but its dreams of forming a governing coalition with the greens seem very distant , with the two parties currently polling 24 and 15 percent of the votes respectively .
confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .
the opposition greens also called the program a grab bag of policies .

" i will not increase value-added tax in the life of the next parliament , " she said bluntly after the meeting .
" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts .

if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .

confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .
the only exception is for children born in germany after 1990 to parents from eu member states . germany 's large turkish community is the group most affected by the current system .
dual citizenship a loyalty problem ?
kenan kolat , head of the turkish community , is a supporter of the campaign . " the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .
marieluise beck of the green party says that forcing foreigners ' children to choose a nationality creates a sense of mistrust between the state and children of migrants .
it is also a very emotional decision for many people .
dieter wiefel-spütz , the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , told the " frankfurter rundschau " newspaper that , " the so-called ' options model ' is a bureaucratic monster which tortures people . "
this year around 3,900 young people with dual nationality in germany will have to make their decision on whether to remain german or to become a foreigner. vj / epd / dpa / frankfurter rundschau editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after three decades of conflict , it 's another step forward for diplomacy . two of northern ireland 's biggest loyalist paramilitary groups , the ulster volunteer force -lrb- uvf -rrb- and the red hand commando -lrb- rhc -rrb- , say they have destroyed their weapons , and have promised to respect local laws .
another group , the ulster defence association -lrb- uda -rrb- , said it has started destroying its weapons , too .

" there is no place for guns and violence in the new society we are building .

the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .
the czech parliament approved the eu 's lisbon treaty earlier this year , though the eurosceptic czech president vaclav klaus is so far refusing to put his signature to ratification .
jury still out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will welcome sweden 's reign others say it is too early to make any judgments , as several issues taken up under the czech presidency will not lead to concrete results for some time , if ever .
these include guarantees for ireland over the lisbon treaty , the eastern partnership project , and plans for the nabucco gas pipeline .
" whether they might overshadow the negative experience with the fall of the government will depend on the success of those particular projects , which the czech presidency was supporting , " says ivo slosarcik of the think-tank europeum .
perhaps history will after all be kinder to the czech eu presidency than present day commentators .
for now , many in europe will be somewhat relieved when the swedes take the helm on july 1 .

" i will not increase value-added tax in the life of the next parliament , " she said bluntly after the meeting .
" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts .

if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the minority party in germany 's grand coalition government , hope to be able to hold on to power .
but its dreams of forming a governing coalition with the greens seem very distant , with the two parties currently polling 24 and 15 percent of the votes respectively .
confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .
the opposition greens also called the program a grab bag of policies .

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .
the only exception is for children born in germany after 1990 to parents from eu member states . germany 's large turkish community is the group most affected by the current system .
dual citizenship a loyalty problem ?
kenan kolat , head of the turkish community , is a supporter of the campaign . " the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .
marieluise beck of the green party says that forcing foreigners ' children to choose a nationality creates a sense of mistrust between the state and children of migrants .
it is also a very emotional decision for many people .
dieter wiefel-spütz , the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , told the " frankfurter rundschau " newspaper that , " the so-called ' options model ' is a bureaucratic monster which tortures people . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 28.06.2009 ill-fated czech presidency of eu draws to a close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech 's have nearly finished their six-month eu presidency the czech republic 's presidency of the european union , which ends on tuesday , will not be remembered as a success .
the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .
the czech parliament approved the eu 's lisbon treaty earlier this year , though the eurosceptic czech president vaclav klaus is so far refusing to put his signature to ratification .
jury still out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will welcome sweden 's reign others say it is too early to make any judgments , as several issues taken up under the czech presidency will not lead to concrete results for some time , if ever .
these include guarantees for ireland over the lisbon treaty , the eastern partnership project , and plans for the nabucco gas pipeline .
" whether they might overshadow the negative experience with the fall of the government will depend on the success of those particular projects , which the czech presidency was supporting , " says ivo slosarcik of the think-tank europeum .
perhaps history will after all be kinder to the czech eu presidency than present day commentators .
for now , many in europe will be somewhat relieved when the swedes take the helm on july 1 .

confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .
the opposition greens also called the program a grab bag of policies .

27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives ' re-election campaign motto reads " we have the power " delegates from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , agreed that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign and should be introduced at some point during the next legislative term . the two parties , however , failed to agree on a date for the cuts , to the dismay of the csu , which wanted to see the measures introduced by 2011 . the chancellor flatly rejected calls to increase germany 's sales taxes to offset income-tax cuts . " i will not increase value-added tax in the life of the next parliament , " she said bluntly after the meeting .
" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts . " merkel loyalists slapped down calls from two state premiers , guenther oettinger of baden wuerttemberg and wolfgang boehmer of saxony-anhalt , to frankly tell the public about sacrifices needed to finance any tax cuts . sitting pretty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some conservatives wanted to increase sales tax on items that currently enjoy reduced rates bavarian premier and csu chairman horst seehofer praised merkel as an " excellent chancellor " and said his party would throw its full support behind her re-election .
if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the minority party in germany 's grand coalition government , hope to be able to hold on to power .
but its dreams of forming a governing coalition with the greens seem very distant , with the two parties currently polling 24 and 15 percent of the votes respectively .
confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .
the opposition greens also called the program a grab bag of policies .
the fdp said their potential allies had laid out a mix of goods on the table , but were holding back on the prices , while the left party called the tax cuts implausible. nw / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no place for guns and violence in the new society we are building .

" all parties agree , as the people of northern ireland do , that the only way forward is through peace and reconciliation , and not through violence , " clinton said . among the local groups to welcome the news were britain 's ministers for northern ireland affairs , the largely irish catholic pro-independence party sinn fein , catholic leader cardinal sean brady and irish president mary mcaleese. msh / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , children who are born in germany to foreign parents must choose between nationalities by age 23 . the campaign was launched last week by a coalition of politicians , churches , social groups , lawyers , and academics who say it is unfair to force children of migrants to choose between germany , where they were raised , and the birthplace of their parents , whose culture and traditions they often share .
since 2000 , children born in germany automatically become german citizens when at least one parent has permanent residency status . up until adulthood those children can also retain citizenship of their parents ' country of origin . sometime between their 18th and 23rd birthday , however , they must renounce their foreign citizenship in order to maintain their status in germany .
the only exception is for children born in germany after 1990 to parents from eu member states . germany 's large turkish community is the group most affected by the current system .

kenan kolat , head of the turkish community , is a supporter of the campaign . " the government now has the opportunity to win over young people , if they forgo this law , " he says . the campaigners have set-up a website to argue their case that , until now , has found little public support . their main message is that dual citizenship does not equate to a loyalty problem .
marieluise beck of the green party says that forcing foreigners ' children to choose a nationality creates a sense of mistrust between the state and children of migrants .
it is also a very emotional decision for many people .
dieter wiefel-spütz , the social democratic party 's domestic policy expert , told the " frankfurter rundschau " newspaper that , " the so-called ' options model ' is a bureaucratic monster which tortures people . "

27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives ' re-election campaign motto reads " we have the power " delegates from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , agreed that tax cuts should be the cornerstone of their re-election campaign and should be introduced at some point during the next legislative term . the two parties , however , failed to agree on a date for the cuts , to the dismay of the csu , which wanted to see the measures introduced by 2011 . the chancellor flatly rejected calls to increase germany 's sales taxes to offset income-tax cuts . " i will not increase value-added tax in the life of the next parliament , " she said bluntly after the meeting .
" right now we do n't need sacrifices , we need moderate cuts . " merkel loyalists slapped down calls from two state premiers , guenther oettinger of baden wuerttemberg and wolfgang boehmer of saxony-anhalt , to frankly tell the public about sacrifices needed to finance any tax cuts . sitting pretty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some conservatives wanted to increase sales tax on items that currently enjoy reduced rates bavarian premier and csu chairman horst seehofer praised merkel as an " excellent chancellor " and said his party would throw its full support behind her re-election .
if recent polls are anything to go by , that prospect looks highly likely three months from now .
the question for the conservatives is who will they govern with ?
the latest opinion polls put the cdu together with the csu on 35 percent of the vote .
that would be just enough to win government with their preferred coalition partners , the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , who are expected to get 15 percent of the vote .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the minority party in germany 's grand coalition government , hope to be able to hold on to power .
but its dreams of forming a governing coalition with the greens seem very distant , with the two parties currently polling 24 and 15 percent of the votes respectively .
confusing the voters ?
the uncomfortable figures , nonetheless , did n't stop the spd from rejecting the conservatives ' platform on sunday .
the spd 's candidate for chancellor and current foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the cdu of confusing voters with competing talk of tax cuts and rises .
the opposition greens also called the program a grab bag of policies .
the fdp said their potential allies had laid out a mix of goods on the table , but were holding back on the prices , while the left party called the tax cuts implausible. nw / dpa / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 28.06.2009 ill-fated czech presidency of eu draws to a close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech 's have nearly finished their six-month eu presidency the czech republic 's presidency of the european union , which ends on tuesday , will not be remembered as a success .
the country 's government fell before it had even reached the half-way stage . the first czech presidency of the eu got off to an intense start in january , thanks to the conflict in gaza and the dispute between russia and ukraine over gas supplies .
yet the government of then-prime minister mirek topolanek won early praise , particularly for its diplomacy in the gas dispute .
yet the government ran into trouble during the last week of march , when the czech opposition succeeded in toppling topolanek 's government .
the government was eventually replaced by an interim cabinet , but by then it had already become , in the eyes of many , something of a lame duck .
that view is disputed by stefan fule , europe minister in the new caretaker government , who described the czech 's six-month presidency as " very successful . "
strong player crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek 's government ran into trouble early on political analyst jiri pehe says the failures of the czech presidency provide a strong argument in favor of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
if passed , the reform treaty would reduce the significance of the revolving presidency .
pehe believes that the current system only works if a strong player is in charge .
" the moment you have at the helm of the eu a newcomer , a weak country , moreover a country that has domestic problems , and at the same time you are supposed to have some kind of european leadership , you have a problem , " pehe says .
the czech parliament approved the eu 's lisbon treaty earlier this year , though the eurosceptic czech president vaclav klaus is so far refusing to put his signature to ratification .
jury still out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will welcome sweden 's reign others say it is too early to make any judgments , as several issues taken up under the czech presidency will not lead to concrete results for some time , if ever .
these include guarantees for ireland over the lisbon treaty , the eastern partnership project , and plans for the nabucco gas pipeline .
" whether they might overshadow the negative experience with the fall of the government will depend on the success of those particular projects , which the czech presidency was supporting , " says ivo slosarcik of the think-tank europeum .
perhaps history will after all be kinder to the czech eu presidency than present day commentators .
for now , many in europe will be somewhat relieved when the swedes take the helm on july 1 .

now a pastime that some argue started in the country 1,800 years ago only to die out during the cultural revolution is making a comeback for the moneyed classes .
in an immaculately tended field in zhejiang province an unusual event is getting underway .
it is unusual , because for years the game of polo was seen as a deeply suspect pastime of the capitalist classes .
but the sport of kings is making a comeback .
' fashion statement ' the day starts with dragon dancers .
many , but by no means all , in the crowd are in their finery .
this is definitely an event for the well-heeled though . "
for a certain person who has bought the big house , the fast cars ... there is a point when you think , what else can i spend my money on ? "
gene wang the matches are raising money for shanghai charities .
gene wang is a shanghainese polo player .
he is a former financial trader who says at the moment he is more interested in " fun " than " work " .
an amateur , mr wang is typical of the new generation of wealthy players taking up the sport here .
" for a certain type of person , who has bought the big house , the fast cars , the designer labels , who has the mistresses , there is a point when you think , what else can i spend my money on ? "
he is careful to make clear though , he does not see himself as quite in that bracket , but he does think , for china 's richest , polo is becoming " a fashion statement " .
gene and another chinese player are paired up with two more experienced team-mates from overseas .
they saddle up and tear off across the grass in front of the marquees .
gene 's training -lrb- three times a week for several months -rrb- appears to have paid off .
within minutes he has scored .

advertisement the sport of kings is making a comeback in china by chris hogg bbc news , shanghai china 's economic development in recent years has created an ever growing class of entrepreneurs and business people who have made their fortunes .
now a pastime that some argue started in the country 1,800 years ago only to die out during the cultural revolution is making a comeback for the moneyed classes .
in an immaculately tended field in zhejiang province an unusual event is getting underway .
it is unusual , because for years the game of polo was seen as a deeply suspect pastime of the capitalist classes .
but the sport of kings is making a comeback .
' fashion statement ' the day starts with dragon dancers .
many , but by no means all , in the crowd are in their finery .
this is definitely an event for the well-heeled though .
for a certain person who has bought the big house , the fast cars ... there is a point when you think , what else can i spend my money on ?
gene wang the matches are raising money for shanghai charities .
gene wang is a shanghainese polo player .
he is a former financial trader who says at the moment he is more interested in " fun " than " work " .
an amateur , mr wang is typical of the new generation of wealthy players taking up the sport here .
" for a certain type of person , who has bought the big house , the fast cars , the designer labels , who has the mistresses , there is a point when you think , what else can i spend my money on ? "
he is careful to make clear though , he does not see himself as quite in that bracket , but he does think , for china 's richest , polo is becoming " a fashion statement " .
gene and another chinese player are paired up with two more experienced team-mates from overseas .
they saddle up and tear off across the grass in front of the marquees .
gene 's training -lrb- three times a week for several months -rrb- appears to have paid off .
within minutes he has scored .

advertisement the sport of kings is making a comeback in china by chris hogg bbc news , shanghai china 's economic development in recent years has created an ever growing class of entrepreneurs and business people who have made their fortunes .
now a pastime that some argue started in the country 1,800 years ago only to die out during the cultural revolution is making a comeback for the moneyed classes .
in an immaculately tended field in zhejiang province an unusual event is getting underway .
it is unusual , because for years the game of polo was seen as a deeply suspect pastime of the capitalist classes .
but the sport of kings is making a comeback .
' fashion statement ' the day starts with dragon dancers .
many , but by no means all , in the crowd are in their finery .
this is definitely an event for the well-heeled though .
for a certain person who has bought the big house , the fast cars ... there is a point when you think , what else can i spend my money on ?
gene wang the matches are raising money for shanghai charities .
gene wang is a shanghainese polo player .
he is a former financial trader who says at the moment he is more interested in " fun " than " work " .
an amateur , mr wang is typical of the new generation of wealthy players taking up the sport here .
" for a certain type of person , who has bought the big house , the fast cars , the designer labels , who has the mistresses , there is a point when you think , what else can i spend my money on ? "
he is careful to make clear though , he does not see himself as quite in that bracket , but he does think , for china 's richest , polo is becoming " a fashion statement " .
gene and another chinese player are paired up with two more experienced team-mates from overseas .
they saddle up and tear off across the grass in front of the marquees .
gene 's training -lrb- three times a week for several months -rrb- appears to have paid off .
within minutes he has scored .
on the sidelines watching the matches is liang shangyan , a chinese entrepreneur , one of the first women to take up the sport in china .
the chinese players are keen to learn , one us expert says " those who are playing polo are the first generation of the country 's rich people , " she explains .
" they are investing in the sport and polo will be popular in china very soon .
you can see today that we have the first chinese team that can compete with their world-class rivals , " she says .
that is perhaps a little over-optimistic .
the chinese players are keen , but helped a lot by the professionals brought in to train them and play alongside them - experts like tom crater , an american .
" i can not believe how fast polo is developing in china , " he says .
" i also play in thailand and indonesia , and the rate of chinese people coming and showing interest in the game and learning the game is phenomenal for me , " mr crater continues .
mysterious traditions polo of course is not just about what happens on the pitch .
in the vip tent the champagne is flowing freely .
the first generation of chinese people to get rich spent most of their time making money and now they want to enjoy themselves , to appreciate the finer things in life .
the founder of the nine dragons hill polo club , today 's host in fact , is steve wyatt .
he says in china polo is becoming the perfect way to show you have made it .
many in the crowd , but not all , were in their finery " it is hats , beautiful dresses , finest champagne , whisky and people looking at the best cars , " he explains .
" that is completely opposite to the horsey set you might find in europe . "
some polo traditions are respected , like treading in the divots -lrb- the pieces of turf cut out of the ground by horses ' hooves -rrb- at half time .
a loudspeaker announcement invites the spectators on to the pitch to replace the turf that has been disturbed , but the commentators have to spell out to people what to do .
it is a reminder that this is still a pastime that is something of a mystery for the moneyed classes here .
however , the organisers of this event say this is a glimpse of the future of the sport worldwide - polo , you might say , with chinese characteristics .
there is no snobbery .
anyone can take part .
as long , that is , as they have got enough money .

inventor ruth amos took a place on the list thanks to her determination to make her stairsteady business a success , despite funding problems .
the magazine noted a shift towards traditionally male jobs with 50 % of those on the list in sectors such as it , engineering and banking .
nominations for the list come from the experts , readers and former winners .
management today also said that the current economic environment means there has been a distinct shift in attitude from optimism last year to sheer hard work for 2009 .
determined to succeed " the recession is bringing out the steel in this year 's 35 under 35 list , " said management today editor matthew gwyther .
35 women cover stars laura stevenson - 32 , sadler 's wells general manager ruth amos - 19 , engineer and inventor jade tong - 34 , associate director at global real estate advisor dtz kate hampton - 34 , children 's investment fund foundation director savannah miller - 30 , creative director of design label twenty8twelve samantha mangwana - 34 , employment solicitor at russell jones & walker specialising in discrimination law " these women are unafraid to knuckle down and make tough decisions - it 's their fierce determination to succeed that really makes them stand out from the crowd .
" the current climate gives us all the more reason to celebrate their exceptional success .
if you can make it now , you can make it any time . "
remarkably , ms amos showed her determination to succeed by persevering with her business despite age proving to be her " biggest hindrance " .
" when i started off , every major bank refused me business banking , and that was something that hit me really hard , " she said .
inspirational ms amos is currently taking three years out after her a-levels to develop her stairsteady - a rail that helps people remain mobile and climb stairs on their own rather than with a chair lift , therefore enabling them to retain their mobility for longer . "
having a family gives me a determination to succeed " savannah miller but gaining a place on the list has been " amazing " , she said .
she said she was stunned " at being named with such well-respected women " .
" i 've now had the pleasure of meeting some of them and they 're such inspirational and amazing role models . "
the magazine has also decided to honour women on maternity leave for the first time , with four nominees currently on such leave .
" just because they are on leave does n't mean they should n't be recognised , " mt assistant features editor and list manager emma de vita said .
job fears she added there is a worry that during a recession the first redundancies will be women on maternity leave .
35 women - facts & figures youngest woman to appear on the list - ruth amos average age , 31 two thirds studied " male " subjects at university - science , business , law , economics one third went to cambridge , oxford or lse more than 50 % of names on list work in " traditionally male " sectors four women on maternity leave list breakdown : 11 entrepreneurs , four bankers , four engineers , three retailers , two lawyers recent figures from the equality and human rights commission show that an estimated 30,000 women lose their job illegally as a result of pregnancy .
" pregnancy or maternity is the most vulnerable time of working women 's lives , when they need stability .
women who really value their job are going to be highly committed to making it work , " she added .
the magazine added it wanted to tackle the issue this year it is often ignored and more likely to be sidelined during a recession .
savannah miller - who runs fashion label twenty8twelve with her sister sienna - is one working mother on the list with two young children and a teenage stepson .
noted for her business acumen , enthusiasm and control of all parts of the business , she says : " if you want something bad enough , you can get it - no matter what .
" as a woman , it 's extremely challenging juggling all that stuff , but i would n't have it any other way .
having a family gives me a determination to succeed . "

one friday in the 1990s i went to the weekly prayer session in tehran .
the bearded man in the pulpit made a fierce speech .
men were punching the air and chanting god is great .
afterwards battalions of women covered by chadors , surged down the road in a black , death to america cloud .
if you wanted to find an iranian stereotype it was a good place to be .
this friday in tehran i went for a walk in the park , partly because of the new rules here restricting the movements of reporters .
and with the british reinstalled in their old position as iran 's official number one enemy , the bbc has been accused of being the centre of psychological warfare , orchestrating the street protests .
one newspaper has accused me , i would say incorrectly , of being ever present at illegal demonstrations and broadcasting inciting commentaries about the events on the streets .
so , perhaps spinelessly , i thought a low profile might be a good idea , especially since it would be almost impossible to get on the news the morning after michael jackson 's death .
pockets of peace i did n't see any chanting , fist-pumpers in the park .
i did n't expect to .
instead there were families picnicking on blankets under the shade of the trees , and girls with loose headscarves playing badminton .
admittedly the park was in well-off north tehran .
plenty of the people here are rich .
the building i 'm in now , and the narrow street it stands on , could be in zurich .
some of the elegant ladies round here spend a lot of time finding a trendy , even a sexy way of almost breaking the rules on what to wear .
in the park there were even a few sweethearts sitting on benches , looking to my western eyes rather innocent .
it is not surprising by the way to find pockets of peace and quiet in a city that is going through a lot of trouble .
dramatic , violent moments tend to happen in short bursts in a limited area , and tehran is vast .
' waging war on god ' i 've been doing quite a bit of walking this week .
until they were pulled back from most of the squares and the street corners in the city centre a couple of days ago , there were long lines of riot police , revolutionary guards and ' basijis ' - militia men mainly armed with thick wooden clubs .
they were there to send a very sharp message from the supreme leader , ayatollah khamenei .
he has ruled that the election was fair , that the result will stand , and that anyone who is unhappy enough with it to try to demonstrate will learn a very sharp lesson at the hands of his men .
one hardline cleric has called for people who take their protests to the streets to be charged with waging war on god , an offence that in iran carries the death penalty .
a diplomat said to me this week that it looks as if the regime has won this round .
it is hard to disagree .
just over a week ago tens of thousands of people were marching through tehran against an election they believed was fraudulent .
now president ahmedinejad seems to be heading for a second term .
in the last few days there have only been a few small demonstrations , so small the protesters were outnumbered by the security forces , who dispersed them with decisive and brutal energy .
at least that is what we think , based on reports from witnesses and hurriedly-filmed mobile phone video posted on websites .
because of the rules restricting reporting , i could n't go into the city centre to check out what was happening as i would normally do .
public argument a round may have been won .
but even if the opposition ca n't get the election overturned , this does not look like the end of the fight .
the crisis has split the top leadership of iran in a way that has never happened before in the 30 years of the islamic republic .
they 've disagreed among themselves many times , but now they are arguing in public .
ayatollah khamenei no longer presents himself as the nation 's arbiter , above politics .
instead he has plunged in to support president ahmedinejad 's re-election .
and mir hossein mousavi , the man who thinks he is the rightful president , has crossed the reddest of iranian red lines .
he has defied the authority of the supreme leader and criticised him , very severely , from his website .
a swathe of iran 's people want change , more freedom and more chances , even within the islamic system .
they are influenced and affected by what 's happening in the rest of the world .
a country ca n't be cut off any more , once it has modern ways to communicate .
this week , as the power of the state has pressed down on the opposition , i 've heard the same phrase about the future from a number of iranians .
it may look quieter now , they say , but under the ashes there is a fire .
