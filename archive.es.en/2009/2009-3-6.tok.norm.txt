in the space of an hour , one lonely 44-year-old woman repeatedly called the police to report an emergency : she needed a man . she 'd been single long enough , she said , and felt the answer was to take the law into her own hands , as it were . while she admitted that she 'd had a few drinks , she was quite to the point .
she wanted an officer who might be of assistance - and she 'd keep on calling until her dream came true . she got to meet a policeman soon enough .
after her 13th call , a patrol van rolled up outside her house to investigate .
and although officers often have to do things they may not like in the line of duty , the one who knocked on her front door was far from obliging , and merely relieved the culprit of her cell phone battery . by then , the lovesick cold caller had sobered up and was quick to apologize .
she even promised to drop off a cake at the precinct the next day . jp / tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the players later tested negative . the investigation has been suspended due to lack of evidence against the players that would suggest " refusing or missing a doping control after being requested . " investigation not closed this does not mean hoffenheim is out of the woods with the dfb .
the team 's doping official peter geigle faces an oral review before the dfb sports court for not informing the players of the doping control and not promptly leading them to where the test was conducted . it is possible that during the oral review , new information could come to light that would resume the investigation against ibertsberger and janker . in response to the circumstances surrounding this investigation , the dfb anti-doping commission has instituted a new policy that will require chaperones to accompany players selected for doping control from the pitch to the doping tests . rainer koch , head of the dfb anti-doping commission , said " this case will have an educational effect on everyone involved .

she wanted an officer who might be of assistance - and she 'd keep on calling until her dream came true . she got to meet a policeman soon enough .

the czech republic holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the pirates are on board the german frigate rheinland pfalz , which apprehended them on tuesday when they attacked a german merchant vessel off somalia with anti-tank missiles and firearms . the frigate is part of the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta in the gulf of aden , which germany joined in december . the foreign office spokesman said no decision had been made whether the nine pirates captured by the german navy would be transferred to kenya . exploring unchartered territory first , independent prosecutors in hamburg need to decide whether the men should face trial in germany .
the german navy has given them all its evidence , and it is now up to them to say whether german interests were at stake during the attack . a specially convened commission , representing germany 's interior , foreign , defence and justice ministries , met this week to discuss the legal status of the pirates - hitherto unchartered legal territory . the hamburg court , which is responsible for maritime legal issues , will provide berlin with more time to decide on what to do with the alleged pirates . a spokesperson for the court has already said that the decision to open the probe meant in no way that the nine men would be brought to germany for processing .
" the government is studying in-depth whether the suspected pirates could , if necessary , be handed over to a third country for prosecution , " the government said thursday in a statement .
this is the first time in germany 's modern history that its navy has made any apprehensions at sea .
one possible destination for the nine men could be kenya , which on thursday received seven suspected somali pirates captured feb .
11 by the us guided-missile cruiser vella gul .
the seven men will face prosecution under a bilateral pact between the us and kenya .
prosecution uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged pirates could be sent to kenya for prosecution the german navy frigate rheinland-pfalz took part tuesday in a dramatic rescue after the nine somalis , allegedly armed with anti-tank rocket launchers and firearms , were said to have attacked a german merchant vessel off the somali coast .
the mv courier , owned by a bremen-based shipping company , had been sailing under an antigua and barbuda flag .
no german nationals were on board .
the interior ministry said wednesday that there were no grounds for a german prosecution of the captured men , because no german interests were judged to have been endangered in the attack .
germany currently has no agreement with third-party countries under which captured pirates could be prosecuted .
under european law , which applies to the german naval mission , pirates can be held for up to 12 days .
the men are to stay on board the rheinland-pfalz until a decision is reached .
in 2008 , pirates seized more than 200 ships off the somali coast , demanding millions of dollars in ransom . jp / dfm / th / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the space of an hour , one lonely 44-year-old woman repeatedly called the police to report an emergency : she needed a man . she 'd been single long enough , she said , and felt the answer was to take the law into her own hands , as it were . while she admitted that she 'd had a few drinks , she was quite to the point .
she wanted an officer who might be of assistance - and she 'd keep on calling until her dream came true . she got to meet a policeman soon enough .
after her 13th call , a patrol van rolled up outside her house to investigate .
and although officers often have to do things they may not like in the line of duty , the one who knocked on her front door was far from obliging , and merely relieved the culprit of her cell phone battery . by then , the lovesick cold caller had sobered up and was quick to apologize .
she even promised to drop off a cake at the precinct the next day . jp / tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech republic holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the pirates are on board the german frigate rheinland pfalz , which apprehended them on tuesday when they attacked a german merchant vessel off somalia with anti-tank missiles and firearms . the frigate is part of the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta in the gulf of aden , which germany joined in december . the foreign office spokesman said no decision had been made whether the nine pirates captured by the german navy would be transferred to kenya . exploring unchartered territory first , independent prosecutors in hamburg need to decide whether the men should face trial in germany .
the german navy has given them all its evidence , and it is now up to them to say whether german interests were at stake during the attack . a specially convened commission , representing germany 's interior , foreign , defence and justice ministries , met this week to discuss the legal status of the pirates - hitherto unchartered legal territory . the hamburg court , which is responsible for maritime legal issues , will provide berlin with more time to decide on what to do with the alleged pirates . a spokesperson for the court has already said that the decision to open the probe meant in no way that the nine men would be brought to germany for processing .
" the government is studying in-depth whether the suspected pirates could , if necessary , be handed over to a third country for prosecution , " the government said thursday in a statement .
this is the first time in germany 's modern history that its navy has made any apprehensions at sea .
one possible destination for the nine men could be kenya , which on thursday received seven suspected somali pirates captured feb .
11 by the us guided-missile cruiser vella gul .
the seven men will face prosecution under a bilateral pact between the us and kenya .
prosecution uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged pirates could be sent to kenya for prosecution the german navy frigate rheinland-pfalz took part tuesday in a dramatic rescue after the nine somalis , allegedly armed with anti-tank rocket launchers and firearms , were said to have attacked a german merchant vessel off the somali coast .
the mv courier , owned by a bremen-based shipping company , had been sailing under an antigua and barbuda flag .
no german nationals were on board .
the interior ministry said wednesday that there were no grounds for a german prosecution of the captured men , because no german interests were judged to have been endangered in the attack .
germany currently has no agreement with third-party countries under which captured pirates could be prosecuted .
under european law , which applies to the german naval mission , pirates can be held for up to 12 days .
the men are to stay on board the rheinland-pfalz until a decision is reached .
in 2008 , pirates seized more than 200 ships off the somali coast , demanding millions of dollars in ransom . jp / dfm / th / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany will also be one of the stops . the us president 's travel plans were announced on thursday , march 5 , by secretary of state hillary clinton in brussels , where she was attending a nato meeting of foreign ministers .
the president , joined by first lady michelle obama , will kick off the european visit in britain on march 31 , where a g20 summit is taking place on the global economic crisis .
obama will then head to france and germany for a meeting of nato leaders , finishing up in the czech republic for special eu-us talks on march 5 .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
according to british newspaper the daily telegraph , the obamas ' uk visit will also include an audience with the queen at buckingham palace .
boosting friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave obama a warm welcome last summer clinton said that obama would be holding bilateral meetings with german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy when he attends the nato summit co-hosted by the french city of strasbourg and german town of kehl .
" president obama is committed , as i am , to strengthening the trans-atlantic alliance , to supporting a strong europe that is a strong partner to the united states and to energize our partnerships to confront the common challenges of our time , " she said .
the president is broadly expected to use the trip to cement trans-atlantic ties , seek help in afghanistan , and coordinate strategies on the worldwide economic downturn .
a welcome guest obama 's maiden voyage outside the united states as president was to canada last month .

" we intend to have an agreement by the end of the year , " clinton told a news conference after a working dinner with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov in geneva .
" this is of the highest priority to our governments . " the so-called start treaty , which was signed in 1991 , committed both parties to cut their stock of arsenal , including reducing missiles to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . lavrov said the current start treaty , which is set to expire in december , had become obsolete and that he expected a new one to be completed on time . no major decisions were expected to arise from the meeting with both sides hoping to set stage for president barack obama 's first meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev at an economic summit in england in early april . at the start of the talks , clinton presented lavrov with a small box with a red button labelled " reset " in english - a reference to a speech by new us vice-president joe biden in january signaling the obama administration 's willingness to improve ties . " we worked hard to get the right russian word , " clinton said about the word " peregruzka " which was also displayed on the button .
" do you think we got it ? " " you got it wrong , " lavrov responded , as they both laughed and posed for photographers both holding the plastic button . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us hopes medvedev will cooperate on a strategic arms treaty instead of using the russian word for " reset " - perezagruzka , the us translators chose the word " peregruzka , " which means " overload " or " overcharge . " the white house is looking to put relations between the two countries on a more positive track through a package of proposals which include accelerated arms control talks and an appeal for help in stopping iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program . clinton made the obama administration 's desire for a fresh start with russia very clear , telling reporters at the european parliament in brussels on thursday that " what we have to be is willing to vigorously press the differences that we have , while seeking common ground wherever possible . " new administration , new approach to this end , the us secretary of state had already exchanged letters with lavrov over a wish to start a new chapter in ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama hope for a fresh start with russia and while the bush administration sought to isolate moscow when it invaded georgia last year , clinton declared that a freeze in communication with russia is of little use .
" i do n't think you punish russia by stopping conversations with them , " she said . the us and russia had also clashed over a missile shield that washington is planning in europe and clinton said she wanted to get talks with russia over the matter on a " serious track . " in any case , one senior us official , who asked to be unidentified , thinks that now is the time for the us to make the most of the wave of goodwill that flowed from obama 's election . " the new administration has much more political juice as it leans forward and tries to re-engage the russians and because of that it will have much more political capital , " the official said . clinton however also emphasized on friday at the european parliament that the obama administration 's push for better ties to russia would not undermine us support for europe . ls / th / tt / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we intend to have an agreement by the end of the year , " clinton told a news conference after a working dinner with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov in geneva .
" this is of the highest priority to our governments . " the so-called start treaty , which was signed in 1991 , committed both parties to cut their stock of arsenal , including reducing missiles to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . lavrov said the current start treaty , which is set to expire in december , had become obsolete and that he expected a new one to be completed on time . no major decisions were expected to arise from the meeting with both sides hoping to set stage for president barack obama 's first meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev at an economic summit in england in early april . at the start of the talks , clinton presented lavrov with a small box with a red button labelled " reset " in english - a reference to a speech by new us vice-president joe biden in january signaling the obama administration 's willingness to improve ties . " we worked hard to get the right russian word , " clinton said about the word " peregruzka " which was also displayed on the button .
" do you think we got it ? " " you got it wrong , " lavrov responded , as they both laughed and posed for photographers both holding the plastic button . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us hopes medvedev will cooperate on a strategic arms treaty instead of using the russian word for " reset " - perezagruzka , the us translators chose the word " peregruzka , " which means " overload " or " overcharge . " the white house is looking to put relations between the two countries on a more positive track through a package of proposals which include accelerated arms control talks and an appeal for help in stopping iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program . clinton made the obama administration 's desire for a fresh start with russia very clear , telling reporters at the european parliament in brussels on thursday that " what we have to be is willing to vigorously press the differences that we have , while seeking common ground wherever possible . " new administration , new approach to this end , the us secretary of state had already exchanged letters with lavrov over a wish to start a new chapter in ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama hope for a fresh start with russia and while the bush administration sought to isolate moscow when it invaded georgia last year , clinton declared that a freeze in communication with russia is of little use .
" i do n't think you punish russia by stopping conversations with them , " she said . the us and russia had also clashed over a missile shield that washington is planning in europe and clinton said she wanted to get talks with russia over the matter on a " serious track . " in any case , one senior us official , who asked to be unidentified , thinks that now is the time for the us to make the most of the wave of goodwill that flowed from obama 's election . " the new administration has much more political juice as it leans forward and tries to re-engage the russians and because of that it will have much more political capital , " the official said . clinton however also emphasized on friday at the european parliament that the obama administration 's push for better ties to russia would not undermine us support for europe . ls / th / tt / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we intend to have an agreement by the end of the year , " clinton told a news conference after a working dinner with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov in geneva .
" this is of the highest priority to our governments . " the so-called start treaty , which was signed in 1991 , committed both parties to cut their stock of arsenal , including reducing missiles to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . lavrov said the current start treaty , which is set to expire in december , had become obsolete and that he expected a new one to be completed on time . no major decisions were expected to arise from the meeting with both sides hoping to set stage for president barack obama 's first meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev at an economic summit in england in early april . at the start of the talks , clinton presented lavrov with a small box with a red button labelled " reset " in english - a reference to a speech by new us vice-president joe biden in january signaling the obama administration 's willingness to improve ties . " we worked hard to get the right russian word , " clinton said about the word " peregruzka " which was also displayed on the button .
" do you think we got it ? " " you got it wrong , " lavrov responded , as they both laughed and posed for photographers both holding the plastic button . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us hopes medvedev will cooperate on a strategic arms treaty instead of using the russian word for " reset " - perezagruzka , the us translators chose the word " peregruzka , " which means " overload " or " overcharge . " the white house is looking to put relations between the two countries on a more positive track through a package of proposals which include accelerated arms control talks and an appeal for help in stopping iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program . clinton made the obama administration 's desire for a fresh start with russia very clear , telling reporters at the european parliament in brussels on thursday that " what we have to be is willing to vigorously press the differences that we have , while seeking common ground wherever possible . " new administration , new approach to this end , the us secretary of state had already exchanged letters with lavrov over a wish to start a new chapter in ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama hope for a fresh start with russia and while the bush administration sought to isolate moscow when it invaded georgia last year , clinton declared that a freeze in communication with russia is of little use .
" i do n't think you punish russia by stopping conversations with them , " she said . the us and russia had also clashed over a missile shield that washington is planning in europe and clinton said she wanted to get talks with russia over the matter on a " serious track . " in any case , one senior us official , who asked to be unidentified , thinks that now is the time for the us to make the most of the wave of goodwill that flowed from obama 's election . " the new administration has much more political juice as it leans forward and tries to re-engage the russians and because of that it will have much more political capital , " the official said . clinton however also emphasized on friday at the european parliament that the obama administration 's push for better ties to russia would not undermine us support for europe . ls / th / tt / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i want to avert any negative repercussions for the party this investigation might have , " he said . although he has laid down these offices , he has retained his parliamentary seat . initial suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tauss said he 'll step aside prosecutors said they had launched an investigation into joerg tauss because there was " an initial suspicion " of the existence of incriminating pictorial material .
however , the spokesman added that tauss could be " completely innocent . " the politician said he could not understand why the searches of his offices in berlin and karlsruhe had taken place , but was not perturbed about the outcome . " i have been concerned with the scene for years , " tauss said .
he said he could not say whether this might an act of revenge . " i am certain that we are going to clear up these accusations , " he told german tv news channel ntv . the investigation tauss is suspected of having received and transmitted pornographic images of children electronically . according to spiegel online , prosecutors found two cell phone numbers used by him in the possession of another man under investigation for child pornography . the report said the pair was in contact a total of 23 times .
tauss is alleged to have sent the other man a short video via cell phone containing child pornography . in return , he received a dvd from the man , spiegel online said . another office used by tauss in his electoral district in karlsruhe was also searched after a parliamentary panel lifted his immunity . innocent until proven guilty as the spd 's media expert , part of tauss ' job was to fight online child pornography .
he implied that that he might have been the victim of some kind of intrigue .

the czech republic holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the pirates are on board the german frigate rheinland pfalz , which apprehended them on tuesday when they attacked a german merchant vessel off somalia with anti-tank missiles and firearms . the frigate is part of the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta in the gulf of aden , which germany joined in december . the foreign office spokesman said no decision had been made whether the nine pirates captured by the german navy would be transferred to kenya . exploring unchartered territory first , independent prosecutors in hamburg need to decide whether the men should face trial in germany .
the german navy has given them all its evidence , and it is now up to them to say whether german interests were at stake during the attack . a specially convened commission , representing germany 's interior , foreign , defence and justice ministries , met this week to discuss the legal status of the pirates - hitherto unchartered legal territory . the hamburg court , which is responsible for maritime legal issues , will provide berlin with more time to decide on what to do with the alleged pirates . a spokesperson for the court has already said that the decision to open the probe meant in no way that the nine men would be brought to germany for processing .
" the government is studying in-depth whether the suspected pirates could , if necessary , be handed over to a third country for prosecution , " the government said thursday in a statement .
this is the first time in germany 's modern history that its navy has made any apprehensions at sea .
one possible destination for the nine men could be kenya , which on thursday received seven suspected somali pirates captured feb .
11 by the us guided-missile cruiser vella gul .
the seven men will face prosecution under a bilateral pact between the us and kenya .
prosecution uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged pirates could be sent to kenya for prosecution the german navy frigate rheinland-pfalz took part tuesday in a dramatic rescue after the nine somalis , allegedly armed with anti-tank rocket launchers and firearms , were said to have attacked a german merchant vessel off the somali coast .
the mv courier , owned by a bremen-based shipping company , had been sailing under an antigua and barbuda flag .
no german nationals were on board .
the interior ministry said wednesday that there were no grounds for a german prosecution of the captured men , because no german interests were judged to have been endangered in the attack .
germany currently has no agreement with third-party countries under which captured pirates could be prosecuted .
under european law , which applies to the german naval mission , pirates can be held for up to 12 days .
the men are to stay on board the rheinland-pfalz until a decision is reached .
in 2008 , pirates seized more than 200 ships off the somali coast , demanding millions of dollars in ransom . jp / dfm / th / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the space of an hour , one lonely 44-year-old woman repeatedly called the police to report an emergency : she needed a man . she 'd been single long enough , she said , and felt the answer was to take the law into her own hands , as it were . while she admitted that she 'd had a few drinks , she was quite to the point .
she wanted an officer who might be of assistance - and she 'd keep on calling until her dream came true . she got to meet a policeman soon enough .
after her 13th call , a patrol van rolled up outside her house to investigate .
and although officers often have to do things they may not like in the line of duty , the one who knocked on her front door was far from obliging , and merely relieved the culprit of her cell phone battery . by then , the lovesick cold caller had sobered up and was quick to apologize .
she even promised to drop off a cake at the precinct the next day . jp / tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we intend to have an agreement by the end of the year , " clinton told a news conference after a working dinner with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov in geneva .
" this is of the highest priority to our governments . " the so-called start treaty , which was signed in 1991 , committed both parties to cut their stock of arsenal , including reducing missiles to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . lavrov said the current start treaty , which is set to expire in december , had become obsolete and that he expected a new one to be completed on time . no major decisions were expected to arise from the meeting with both sides hoping to set stage for president barack obama 's first meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev at an economic summit in england in early april . at the start of the talks , clinton presented lavrov with a small box with a red button labelled " reset " in english - a reference to a speech by new us vice-president joe biden in january signaling the obama administration 's willingness to improve ties . " we worked hard to get the right russian word , " clinton said about the word " peregruzka " which was also displayed on the button .

" the white house is looking to put relations between the two countries on a more positive track through a package of proposals which include accelerated arms control talks and an appeal for help in stopping iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program . clinton made the obama administration 's desire for a fresh start with russia very clear , telling reporters at the european parliament in brussels on thursday that " what we have to be is willing to vigorously press the differences that we have , while seeking common ground wherever possible . " new administration , new approach to this end , the us secretary of state had already exchanged letters with lavrov over a wish to start a new chapter in ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama hope for a fresh start with russia and while the bush administration sought to isolate moscow when it invaded georgia last year , clinton declared that a freeze in communication with russia is of little use .
" i do n't think you punish russia by stopping conversations with them , " she said . the us and russia had also clashed over a missile shield that washington is planning in europe and clinton said she wanted to get talks with russia over the matter on a " serious track . " in any case , one senior us official , who asked to be unidentified , thinks that now is the time for the us to make the most of the wave of goodwill that flowed from obama 's election . " the new administration has much more political juice as it leans forward and tries to re-engage the russians and because of that it will have much more political capital , " the official said . clinton however also emphasized on friday at the european parliament that the obama administration 's push for better ties to russia would not undermine us support for europe . ls / th / tt / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech republic holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the pirates are on board the german frigate rheinland pfalz , which apprehended them on tuesday when they attacked a german merchant vessel off somalia with anti-tank missiles and firearms . the frigate is part of the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta in the gulf of aden , which germany joined in december . the foreign office spokesman said no decision had been made whether the nine pirates captured by the german navy would be transferred to kenya . exploring unchartered territory first , independent prosecutors in hamburg need to decide whether the men should face trial in germany .
the german navy has given them all its evidence , and it is now up to them to say whether german interests were at stake during the attack . a specially convened commission , representing germany 's interior , foreign , defence and justice ministries , met this week to discuss the legal status of the pirates - hitherto unchartered legal territory . the hamburg court , which is responsible for maritime legal issues , will provide berlin with more time to decide on what to do with the alleged pirates . a spokesperson for the court has already said that the decision to open the probe meant in no way that the nine men would be brought to germany for processing .
" the government is studying in-depth whether the suspected pirates could , if necessary , be handed over to a third country for prosecution , " the government said thursday in a statement .
this is the first time in germany 's modern history that its navy has made any apprehensions at sea .
one possible destination for the nine men could be kenya , which on thursday received seven suspected somali pirates captured feb .
11 by the us guided-missile cruiser vella gul .
the seven men will face prosecution under a bilateral pact between the us and kenya .
prosecution uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged pirates could be sent to kenya for prosecution the german navy frigate rheinland-pfalz took part tuesday in a dramatic rescue after the nine somalis , allegedly armed with anti-tank rocket launchers and firearms , were said to have attacked a german merchant vessel off the somali coast .
the mv courier , owned by a bremen-based shipping company , had been sailing under an antigua and barbuda flag .
no german nationals were on board .
the interior ministry said wednesday that there were no grounds for a german prosecution of the captured men , because no german interests were judged to have been endangered in the attack .
germany currently has no agreement with third-party countries under which captured pirates could be prosecuted .
under european law , which applies to the german naval mission , pirates can be held for up to 12 days .
the men are to stay on board the rheinland-pfalz until a decision is reached .
in 2008 , pirates seized more than 200 ships off the somali coast , demanding millions of dollars in ransom . jp / dfm / th / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his colleagues within the social democratic party said the accusations needed to be addressed calmly . " this needs to be cleared up , " said ute vogt , the chairwoman of tauss 's regional party association in southwestern germany .

the czech republic holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the pirates are on board the german frigate rheinland pfalz , which apprehended them on tuesday when they attacked a german merchant vessel off somalia with anti-tank missiles and firearms . the frigate is part of the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta in the gulf of aden , which germany joined in december . the foreign office spokesman said no decision had been made whether the nine pirates captured by the german navy would be transferred to kenya . exploring unchartered territory first , independent prosecutors in hamburg need to decide whether the men should face trial in germany .
the german navy has given them all its evidence , and it is now up to them to say whether german interests were at stake during the attack . a specially convened commission , representing germany 's interior , foreign , defence and justice ministries , met this week to discuss the legal status of the pirates - hitherto unchartered legal territory . the hamburg court , which is responsible for maritime legal issues , will provide berlin with more time to decide on what to do with the alleged pirates . a spokesperson for the court has already said that the decision to open the probe meant in no way that the nine men would be brought to germany for processing .
" the government is studying in-depth whether the suspected pirates could , if necessary , be handed over to a third country for prosecution , " the government said thursday in a statement .
this is the first time in germany 's modern history that its navy has made any apprehensions at sea .
one possible destination for the nine men could be kenya , which on thursday received seven suspected somali pirates captured feb .
11 by the us guided-missile cruiser vella gul .
the seven men will face prosecution under a bilateral pact between the us and kenya .
prosecution uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged pirates could be sent to kenya for prosecution the german navy frigate rheinland-pfalz took part tuesday in a dramatic rescue after the nine somalis , allegedly armed with anti-tank rocket launchers and firearms , were said to have attacked a german merchant vessel off the somali coast .
the mv courier , owned by a bremen-based shipping company , had been sailing under an antigua and barbuda flag .
no german nationals were on board .
the interior ministry said wednesday that there were no grounds for a german prosecution of the captured men , because no german interests were judged to have been endangered in the attack .
germany currently has no agreement with third-party countries under which captured pirates could be prosecuted .
under european law , which applies to the german naval mission , pirates can be held for up to 12 days .
the men are to stay on board the rheinland-pfalz until a decision is reached .
in 2008 , pirates seized more than 200 ships off the somali coast , demanding millions of dollars in ransom . jp / dfm / th / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the space of an hour , one lonely 44-year-old woman repeatedly called the police to report an emergency : she needed a man . she 'd been single long enough , she said , and felt the answer was to take the law into her own hands , as it were . while she admitted that she 'd had a few drinks , she was quite to the point .
she wanted an officer who might be of assistance - and she 'd keep on calling until her dream came true . she got to meet a policeman soon enough .
after her 13th call , a patrol van rolled up outside her house to investigate .
and although officers often have to do things they may not like in the line of duty , the one who knocked on her front door was far from obliging , and merely relieved the culprit of her cell phone battery . by then , the lovesick cold caller had sobered up and was quick to apologize .
she even promised to drop off a cake at the precinct the next day . jp / tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the president , joined by first lady michelle obama , will kick off the european visit in britain on march 31 , where a g20 summit is taking place on the global economic crisis .
obama will then head to france and germany for a meeting of nato leaders , finishing up in the czech republic for special eu-us talks on march 5 .

" president obama is committed , as i am , to strengthening the trans-atlantic alliance , to supporting a strong europe that is a strong partner to the united states and to energize our partnerships to confront the common challenges of our time , " she said .
the president is broadly expected to use the trip to cement trans-atlantic ties , seek help in afghanistan , and coordinate strategies on the worldwide economic downturn .
a welcome guest obama 's maiden voyage outside the united states as president was to canada last month .

the czech republic holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the pirates are on board the german frigate rheinland pfalz , which apprehended them on tuesday when they attacked a german merchant vessel off somalia with anti-tank missiles and firearms . the frigate is part of the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta in the gulf of aden , which germany joined in december . the foreign office spokesman said no decision had been made whether the nine pirates captured by the german navy would be transferred to kenya . exploring unchartered territory first , independent prosecutors in hamburg need to decide whether the men should face trial in germany .
the german navy has given them all its evidence , and it is now up to them to say whether german interests were at stake during the attack . a specially convened commission , representing germany 's interior , foreign , defence and justice ministries , met this week to discuss the legal status of the pirates - hitherto unchartered legal territory . the hamburg court , which is responsible for maritime legal issues , will provide berlin with more time to decide on what to do with the alleged pirates . a spokesperson for the court has already said that the decision to open the probe meant in no way that the nine men would be brought to germany for processing .
" the government is studying in-depth whether the suspected pirates could , if necessary , be handed over to a third country for prosecution , " the government said thursday in a statement .
this is the first time in germany 's modern history that its navy has made any apprehensions at sea .
one possible destination for the nine men could be kenya , which on thursday received seven suspected somali pirates captured feb .
11 by the us guided-missile cruiser vella gul .
the seven men will face prosecution under a bilateral pact between the us and kenya .
prosecution uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged pirates could be sent to kenya for prosecution the german navy frigate rheinland-pfalz took part tuesday in a dramatic rescue after the nine somalis , allegedly armed with anti-tank rocket launchers and firearms , were said to have attacked a german merchant vessel off the somali coast .
the mv courier , owned by a bremen-based shipping company , had been sailing under an antigua and barbuda flag .
no german nationals were on board .
the interior ministry said wednesday that there were no grounds for a german prosecution of the captured men , because no german interests were judged to have been endangered in the attack .
germany currently has no agreement with third-party countries under which captured pirates could be prosecuted .
under european law , which applies to the german naval mission , pirates can be held for up to 12 days .
the men are to stay on board the rheinland-pfalz until a decision is reached .
in 2008 , pirates seized more than 200 ships off the somali coast , demanding millions of dollars in ransom . jp / dfm / th / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the space of an hour , one lonely 44-year-old woman repeatedly called the police to report an emergency : she needed a man . she 'd been single long enough , she said , and felt the answer was to take the law into her own hands , as it were . while she admitted that she 'd had a few drinks , she was quite to the point .
she wanted an officer who might be of assistance - and she 'd keep on calling until her dream came true . she got to meet a policeman soon enough .
after her 13th call , a patrol van rolled up outside her house to investigate .
and although officers often have to do things they may not like in the line of duty , the one who knocked on her front door was far from obliging , and merely relieved the culprit of her cell phone battery . by then , the lovesick cold caller had sobered up and was quick to apologize .
she even promised to drop off a cake at the precinct the next day . jp / tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the maker of the luxury mercedes brand said " persistently strong declines in nearly all markets " and the forthcoming release of the new e-class model , which meant car buyers where holding out on new purchases , had driven the sales slump .
daimler said however that it had taken 40,000 advance orders on the new e-class .

sales of its flagship mercedes-benz brand were down 27.8 percent to 63,600 , while sales of its smart city car declined 1.9 percent to 8,600 , the company said .
in the us , however , sales of smart cars rose 29 percent to 1,400 cars from 1,100 in 2008 .

" we intend to have an agreement by the end of the year , " clinton told a news conference after a working dinner with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov in geneva .
" this is of the highest priority to our governments . " the so-called start treaty , which was signed in 1991 , committed both parties to cut their stock of arsenal , including reducing missiles to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . lavrov said the current start treaty , which is set to expire in december , had become obsolete and that he expected a new one to be completed on time . no major decisions were expected to arise from the meeting with both sides hoping to set stage for president barack obama 's first meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev at an economic summit in england in early april . at the start of the talks , clinton presented lavrov with a small box with a red button labelled " reset " in english - a reference to a speech by new us vice-president joe biden in january signaling the obama administration 's willingness to improve ties . " we worked hard to get the right russian word , " clinton said about the word " peregruzka " which was also displayed on the button .
" do you think we got it ? " " you got it wrong , " lavrov responded , as they both laughed and posed for photographers both holding the plastic button . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us hopes medvedev will cooperate on a strategic arms treaty instead of using the russian word for " reset " - perezagruzka , the us translators chose the word " peregruzka , " which means " overload " or " overcharge . " the white house is looking to put relations between the two countries on a more positive track through a package of proposals which include accelerated arms control talks and an appeal for help in stopping iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program . clinton made the obama administration 's desire for a fresh start with russia very clear , telling reporters at the european parliament in brussels on thursday that " what we have to be is willing to vigorously press the differences that we have , while seeking common ground wherever possible . " new administration , new approach to this end , the us secretary of state had already exchanged letters with lavrov over a wish to start a new chapter in ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama hope for a fresh start with russia and while the bush administration sought to isolate moscow when it invaded georgia last year , clinton declared that a freeze in communication with russia is of little use .
" i do n't think you punish russia by stopping conversations with them , " she said . the us and russia had also clashed over a missile shield that washington is planning in europe and clinton said she wanted to get talks with russia over the matter on a " serious track . " in any case , one senior us official , who asked to be unidentified , thinks that now is the time for the us to make the most of the wave of goodwill that flowed from obama 's election . " the new administration has much more political juice as it leans forward and tries to re-engage the russians and because of that it will have much more political capital , " the official said . clinton however also emphasized on friday at the european parliament that the obama administration 's push for better ties to russia would not undermine us support for europe . ls / th / tt / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we had an open , good and constructive conversation with the general motors management , " said economic minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg after the hour-long meeting .
" but there were many issues that still need to be cleared up . " gm europe president and opel supervisory board chief , carl-peter forster , meanwhile stressed that gm and opel would do everything to get the government the information they requested regarding restructuring plans at opel . nonetheless , the german government will not decide for several weeks about possible state aid for the troubled car maker , a spokesman said . " talks will last several more weeks , " said ulrich wilhelm .
" both sides note that there are still a lot of unanswered questions . " also taking part in friday 's meeting along with zu guttenberg and forster were chancellery chief of staff thomas de maiziere , top finance ministry official joerg asmussen , gm chief operating officer fritz henderson and opel chief executive hans demant . too slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many opel employees are hoping for survival by leaving gm chancellor angela merkel called the meeting in the capital to discuss a possible government rescue .
merkel has been unhappy with the slow pace of the rescue efforts . the meeting came after government politicians reiterated their support for opel . but german finance minster peer steinbrueck , as well as other politicians , said details in the rescue plan presented this week by opel insufficient to warrant receiving a federal bail out . guttenberg agreed that opel would have to present a plan ensuring its future before the government would provide it with funding . " we need a company that is going to survive in the market not just for four or five months , but one that has long-term perspective , " he said , adding that he would travel to the united states in mid-march to conduct talks with gm leaders as well as us government . steinmeier : opel task force foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is running for the social democratic party against merkel for the chancellorship in september , suggested federal and state government officials as well business leaders form a task force to determine ways to ensure opel 's survival , according to a report in friday 's handelsblatt . one possibility floated by hesse state premier roland koch was to fund an opel-vauxhall company based in germany and independent of gm with up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.27 billion -rrb- , koch wrote in a handelsblatt op-ed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government ca n't afford to throw a line to every struggling company , experts said experts , however , warned of providing government funds to struggling companies .
the munich-based ifo institute said opel was the tip of the bail-out iceberg and that the government would not be able to rescue every company that requests aid . " the state can not comply with every request because it does not have enough money to , " the institute said . gm has requested a total of 3.3 billion euros from the european countries where it has factories and said it would be forced to lay off thousands of european employees regardless of whether it receives the money . a german parliamentary committee has also said it plans to address the auto crisis by inviting forster as well as the head of the ig metall trade union to testify at its next meeting , according to the economics committee spokeswoman ulla loetzer . jp / sms / th / ap / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we intend to have an agreement by the end of the year , " clinton told a news conference after a working dinner with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov in geneva .
" this is of the highest priority to our governments . " the so-called start treaty , which was signed in 1991 , committed both parties to cut their stock of arsenal , including reducing missiles to a maximum of 1,600 and warheads to no more than 6,000 . lavrov said the current start treaty , which is set to expire in december , had become obsolete and that he expected a new one to be completed on time . no major decisions were expected to arise from the meeting with both sides hoping to set stage for president barack obama 's first meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev at an economic summit in england in early april . at the start of the talks , clinton presented lavrov with a small box with a red button labelled " reset " in english - a reference to a speech by new us vice-president joe biden in january signaling the obama administration 's willingness to improve ties . " we worked hard to get the right russian word , " clinton said about the word " peregruzka " which was also displayed on the button .
" do you think we got it ? " " you got it wrong , " lavrov responded , as they both laughed and posed for photographers both holding the plastic button . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us hopes medvedev will cooperate on a strategic arms treaty instead of using the russian word for " reset " - perezagruzka , the us translators chose the word " peregruzka , " which means " overload " or " overcharge . " the white house is looking to put relations between the two countries on a more positive track through a package of proposals which include accelerated arms control talks and an appeal for help in stopping iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program . clinton made the obama administration 's desire for a fresh start with russia very clear , telling reporters at the european parliament in brussels on thursday that " what we have to be is willing to vigorously press the differences that we have , while seeking common ground wherever possible . " new administration , new approach to this end , the us secretary of state had already exchanged letters with lavrov over a wish to start a new chapter in ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton and obama hope for a fresh start with russia and while the bush administration sought to isolate moscow when it invaded georgia last year , clinton declared that a freeze in communication with russia is of little use .
" i do n't think you punish russia by stopping conversations with them , " she said . the us and russia had also clashed over a missile shield that washington is planning in europe and clinton said she wanted to get talks with russia over the matter on a " serious track . " in any case , one senior us official , who asked to be unidentified , thinks that now is the time for the us to make the most of the wave of goodwill that flowed from obama 's election . " the new administration has much more political juice as it leans forward and tries to re-engage the russians and because of that it will have much more political capital , " the official said . clinton however also emphasized on friday at the european parliament that the obama administration 's push for better ties to russia would not undermine us support for europe . ls / th / tt / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ieuan wyn jones said opponents of plans to scrap a grant which covers the cost of student top-up fees had to " take responsibility for their own actions " .
plaid mp adam price called the plans a " breach " of the spirit of the coalition agreement between labour and his party .
but mr jones said he believed the plans were " within the spirit " of the deal .
currently , welsh students studying in wales receive a subsidy of around £ 2,000 towards the costs of their tuition , rather than paying the full fee of up to £ 3,225 . "
the mark of leadership is being prepared to take difficult decisions , being prepared to argue your corner " ieuan wyn jones , plaid cymru leader plaid fought the 2007 assembly election promising it would not make students pay the extra , often referred to as top-up fees .
plaid cymru 's national council reaffirmed its opposition to top-up fees last month and defeated a motion proposed by the party 's leadership to review the policy .
mr jones , who is also deputy first minister , told members he would not be able to convince the assembly government cabinet , which has a labour majority , to match plaid 's position .
in his first interview on the subject he told bbc wales ' dragon 's eye he was not " forced " to surrender the policy by his labour colleagues .
" we argued very hard indeed as you would expect for the package to be an enhanced package of student support , " he said .
" we wanted to ensure that student debt was properly addressed .
" as a result i think of what we said , that will happen . "
it emerged on wednesday that mr price had written to education minister jane hutt , calling for cabinet discussion on the matter to be " reopened " .
mr price said the cabinet 's decision to abolish the student subsidy , or tuition fee grant , was based on " highly misleading evidence " .
however , mr jones said he was satisfied they had " done the best they could do in the circumstances " .
" there will be occasions with people disagreeing with what you do , " he said .
" there will be occasions when some people may well feel very disappointed .
" the mark of leadership is being prepared to take difficult decisions , being prepared to argue your corner , being prepared to make sure that student debt is properly addressed within the government . "
bbc wales political editor betsan powys said she doubted that mr jones had emerged stronger from the fallout .
" i do n't see how this week can possibly have enhanced his party 's position nor its leader 's position either , " she said .
" what adam price has done here is to put the focus right back on this being a decision taken in cardiff by a welsh government and of course his own party and that is n't helpful to them in the long run . "
a consultation on the proposals , which would also see more money go directly to universities and an increase in means-tested grants , ended last month .
ms hutt is expected to make a statement on its outcome before easter .

the welsh local government association -lrb- wlga -rrb- said 11 councils were expecting to make jobs cuts in 2009-10 .
its survey found councils in south-east wales were expecting to make 300 job cuts while those in south-west wales were planning to make more than 200 .
wlga leader john davies said times were " extraordinarily tough " for councils .
the body , which represents wales ' 22 local authorities , said the economic slowdown meant every council in wales expected to overspend on its 2008-09 budget , with additional demands on services such as welfare advice and housing benefit applications .
it said councils expected their overall income to fall short by nearly £ 35m during 2009-10 as a result of loss of interest , interest cuts and the impact of economic slowdown . "
the recession has exacerbated local government pressures at a time when councils are already struggling through insufficient budget settlements " john davies , wlga almost half of councils have reduced staff numbers by seeking voluntary redundancies or introducing a full or partial recruitment freeze .
others were conducting reviews to ensure that filling a vacant post was essential , it said .
mr davies , a pembrokeshire councillor , said : " we are all in the situation where our income is falling , yet our expenditure is increasing .

mr davies , a pembrokeshire councillor , said : " we are all in the situation where our income is falling , yet our expenditure is increasing .
" over the last year we have already seen a significant downsizing of local government services and staff levels as a result of insufficient funding for local government .
asset sales " the recession has exacerbated local government pressures at a time when councils are already struggling through insufficient budget settlements . "
he said the survey of all 22 councils in wales showed " what local government has been saying for many years - there is only so much that been squeezed out of an already pressurised system before something gives " .
he said the recession had added to existing pressures on council incomes , with 20 local authorities reporting a reduction in the number of planning applications being made .
asset sales were also falling through a fall in land value and developers ' lack of confidence in the current market while councils ' balances were being hit by interest rate cuts .

the movie cost around $ 100m -lrb- £ 70m -rrb- and was filmed in vancouver , canada from the second the opening credits roll , it is clear watchmen is not your typical superhero movie .
an ageing vigilante , the comedian , is attacked in his high-rise apartment before being hurled 10 storeys to his death ... in graphic slow motion .
what follows is a two-and-three-quarter hour epic that centres on an outlawed group of deeply flawed former heroes as a cold war doomsday clock inches ever closer to midnight and nuclear apocalypse .
first published in 12 parts by dc comics in 1986 , watchmen was written by the british team of alan moore and illustrator dave gibbons .
deconstructing the myth of the superhero , it posed fairly grandiose questions .
what if costumed vigilantes really existed ?
what kind of person hides behind a mask and takes it upon himself to fight crime ?
and ultimately , how far would they go to protect humanity ?
numerous attempts to film the book , included by time magazine in its list of the top 100 books of the 20th century , failed to get off the ground .
when the script came to me , it was a pg-13 movie zack snyder respected directors like terry gilliam , paul greengrass and darren aronofsky were all involved at various stages .
and legal wranglings between rival film studios over the adaptation rights threatened to wreck the project altogether .
so it has fallen to zack snyder , the man who helmed 2007 's surprise hit 300 , to succeed where others have failed .
action figures in bringing the novel to the big screen as an 18-certificate movie , snyder has forgone a sizeable teenage audience by featuring graphic scenes of violence , rape and erectile dysfunction .
" when the script came to me it was a pg-13 movie - two hours long , updated to the war on terror and sequel-able , " said the 43-year-old director .
" the idea that a happy meal could be made out of watchmen is reason enough not let a kid go and see the movie . "
and yet the merchandising wheel keeps turning , with action figures , costumes , playing cards and lunchboxes already on the market .
the comedian , in one respect , is america 's hero .
but on the other hand he 's also america 's dirty little secret jeffrey dean morgan this perhaps explains why moore disassociated himself from the movie , as he has done with every film adapted from his novels .
and there have been several : from hell starring johnny depp , v for vendetta and the universally panned league of extraordinary gentlemen .
" when i first got on the project , he had already divorced himself from it , " said snyder .
" i remember saying to the producers , ' when do we go and see alan ? '
they said , ' it 's not going to happen .
he 's asked that we do n't contact him about it . '
" because i was such a big fan , i thought if that 's what he wants , then that 's what we have to do . "
building manhattan set in an alternative 1985 , with richard nixon still in power for a fifth term and the us and soviet union at each other 's throats , watchmen plays out like a murder mystery .
at its centre is rorschach , a paranoid vigilante whose face is covered with an ink blot mask , who takes it upon himself to investigate the comedian 's murder .
dr manhattan -lrb- right -rrb- was created using computer-generated imagery with the presence of dr manhattan - a super being who works for the us government - straining international tensions further , rorschach stumbles on a plan that threatens billions of lives .
billy crudup plays the blue-skinned manhattan , the fantastic result of an experiment gone wrong and the only character with genuine superpowers .
the actor was recreated as a computer-generated image and appears as a hugely muscular , frequently naked presence .
" none of it is me , " he revealed .
" they used high-resolution photography and laser scanning and built an exact replica of my face and head in a computer .
" then they drew up that terrific body and put him into action as i watched from afar . "
a brit abroad british actor matthew goode went straight from making brideshead revisited to playing adrian veidt , aka ozymandias , a former watchman with a dark secret .
" i seem to remember the fans being extremely distressed that i 'd been cast , " he told the bbc news website .
alan 's never going to say if he likes it or does n't like it matthew goode , aka ozymandias " my brother phoned me on the first day of filming and said , ' i 've just been on the internet and apparently your casting is by far the least favourable .
" ' they 're very worried you 're going to ruin the entire movie . '
i was like , ' thanks boss , i 'll see you in six months .
do n't call ' cause i do n't like you very much any more . " '
elsewhere jeffrey dean morgan plays the comedian , a nihilistic , violent and cigar-chomping misogynist .
the character is killed off at the beginning of the film but is subsequently seen in flashbacks .
with shoulder pads decorated with stars and stripes , he is the dark opposite of comic book icon captain america .
" the comedian , in one respect , is america 's hero , " said the grey 's anatomy regular .
" but on the other hand , he 's also america 's dirty little secret . "
with watchmen released across the uk this weekend , that secret is now definitely out .
