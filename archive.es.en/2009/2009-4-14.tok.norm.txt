he will take over from socialist ferenc gyurcsany , who resigned on march 21 .
gyurcsany said last month that a new interim government and a new prime minister were needed to turn the country 's economy around .
hungary is suffering its deepest economic crisis in nearly 20 years and has been one of the countries in eastern europe worst hit by the financial and economic crisis .
financial meltdown was averted only by a massive bailout package of international organizations last october .
managing the crisis without playing politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police kept demonstrators calling for early elections at bay bajnai , a wealthy businessman with no party affiliation , describes himself as " a crisis manager without political ambition . "
immediately after tuesday 's vote , he unveiled his new cabinet , which includes six new ministers .
he said they were experts who , like himself , were free of party affiliations and would take over the key portfolios of finance , economy , social welfare and energy .
bajnai was nominated after nine days of negotiations between the socialists and the small liberal opposition free democrats party .
center-right party wants early elections , not bajnai hungary 's largest opposition group , the center-right fidesz party , did not participate in tuesday 's vote and has labeled the proposed interim government as " illegitimate . "
it is demanding that elections be brought forward from spring 2010 .
bajnai warned that elections are not the answer .
" as long as the majority of mps support a government 's austerity program , a crisis-management government is a better solution for hungary than early elections , " he said .
bajnai has said he would not delay in introducing austerity measures and economic reforms and that this would require sacrifices from many hungarians .
bajnai 's planned austerity measures are likely to include cuts to pensions and public service employee salaries . wl / jen , afp / dpa / reu send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who head the government 's two main coalition parties , the christian democrats and the social democrats respectively , want to use the berlin meeting to assess the current economic situation in germany and discuss potential future developments , the sueddeutsche said .

unemployment in february was 7.4 percent , up 0.1 points from january but 0.2 points lower than in february 2008 .

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

" " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

washington hopes the new measures will induce the communist state to pursue democratic reforms . us president barack obama has issued an executive order that lifts restrictions on cuban americans traveling and sending money back to the communist island as part of a much-anticipated reversal of us policy .

although the new measures mark a major us policy shift , they do not eliminate washington 's 47-year-old trade embargo against cuba , and travel restrictions for most non-cuban americans will stay in place . the white house hopes its new approach will encourage cuba 's one-party state , currently led by president raul castro , to start implementing democratic reforms .

" we have to stop because we need to look after the lives of our supporters , " said jatuporn prompan , one of the leaders of the red-shirted protesters loyal to former premier shinawatra who still commands widespread loyalty among the rural poor .
" we need to save the lives of every innocent citizen who aimed at nothing but to bring back democracy to the country , " said veera musikapong , another protest leader , in a statement . thai police also said that four protest leaders , who had led the rioting , had voluntarily turned themselves in .
police said the four had been taken into custody for questioning .
protesters had been camped at the government building for three weeks before an army crackdown started before dawn in bangkok on monday , and when violence flared two people were left dead and more than 100 wounded , including at least 23 soldiers .
fear of reprisals brings protests to a close protest leaders were fearful that " right-wing thugs " would sweep in behind the troops to take revenge on their political rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters feared reprisals from the military and hard-liners the opposition accused certain hard-line members of the government of organizing " thugs " to attack protesters last week .
the rival yellow shirts , who helped bring down a pro-thaksin government last year , had also threatened to reform and attack the pro-thaksin demonstrators .
jakrapob penkair , a red-shirt strategist , said with so many " goons and gangsters " lurking around , there might even be a replay of the october 6 , 1976 massacre of student demonstrators carried out by mobs of right-wing activists .
the ' red shirts ' vowed to return , however .
" this is not the end .
we 'll be back .
our leaders will meet after songkran to discuss our next move , " one protest leader , nattawut saikuar , told reuters .
there was deep disappointment on the faces of protesters - whose numbers hit 100,000 last week but dwindled to only a few thousand tuesday - who managed to rock the government and shock the country . public opinion turns against thaksin supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shinawatra retains support - but not everyone is a fan many bangkok residents are angry with the protesters - many of whom came from far outside the capital - for setting fire to buses and threatening to explode gas trucks near homes in the cause of a man many in the capital see as deeply corrupt . many thais appeared stunned by the breakdown of law and order that threatened when the security forces appeared unable or unwilling to restrain the red-shirted protestors . on saturday a group of red-shirt protestors deeply embarrassed prime minister abhisit vejjajiva and the military by invading a 16-nation asian summit being hosted by thailand at the seaside resort city of pattaya , causing it to be cancelled . abhisit told reporters he would not negotiate with thaksin .
" we want peace .
we want to violence to stop .
and then we must work and talk to bring stability and happiness to the country , " he said in brief remarks tuesday morning . thaksin has incited his supporters to " revolution " and " historical change " in almost nightly addresses to the protesters via video link or phone from exile abroad .
he faces a two-year prison sentence for corruption if he returns to thailand . the protesters want the government to resign to hold fresh elections which thaksin , with his big rural support , might still win . abhisit 's democrat party gained power four months ago after the military and bureaucracy disabled pro-thaksin governments and a parliamentary faction defected to the democrats from the thaksin camp . nda / gb / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington hopes the new measures will induce the communist state to pursue democratic reforms . us president barack obama has issued an executive order that lifts restrictions on cuban americans traveling and sending money back to the communist island as part of a much-anticipated reversal of us policy .
obama also directed his government to look into the possibility of starting regularly scheduled commercial flights to cuba .
currently air travel between cuba and the united states is still limited to charter flights .
obama 's executive order calls for more humanitarian donations to be sent to cuba as well as expanded communications links .
us telecommunications companies will be allowed to reach agreements to provide fiber-optic cable and satellite communications in cuba .
although the new measures mark a major us policy shift , they do not eliminate washington 's 47-year-old trade embargo against cuba , and travel restrictions for most non-cuban americans will stay in place . the white house hopes its new approach will encourage cuba 's one-party state , currently led by president raul castro , to start implementing democratic reforms .
these have long been demanded by washington as a condition for removing sanctions imposed after fidel castro took power in 1959 . nk / sje , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the order from the german parliament came after party treasurer erwin keman was jailed last year for siphoning off hundreds of thousands of euros for his own company .
the npd is appealing the fine , but if the appeal fails , the party will be on the brink of financial ruin and will be lacking the funds it needs to campaign for the upcoming federal and state elections .
the accounting scandal has caused tension within the party and has weakened the authority of its leader udo voigt .
despite this , voigt still managed to win a recent leadership challenge by udo pastoers , the npd leader in the mecklenburg-western pomerania state parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt has led the party since 1996 richard stoess , an expert on the npd from berlin 's free university , says the recent internal conflict shows that there is much criticism of voigt 's leadership .
" but the criticism is not so strong that they would dump the party leadership and vote another person into the position , " says stoess .
a boost from the financial crisis the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , but some analysts believe that the global financial crisis may in fact boost support for the far-right .
there are fears that if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil , then voters will turn to the npd .
voigt showed himself confident his party will do well in state elections later this year , despite its financial problems .
" i think we 've got good chances in three state parliaments , " he said .
the npd is currently represented in two states : saxony with eight representatives and mecklenburg-western pomerania with six .
the party is expected to do well again in the upcoming elections .
the npd could also win the five percent required to gain representation in the state of thuringia .
german voters also head to the polls in september for the federal election .
the npd has so far failed in its attempt to enter federal parliament , winning only 1.6 percent at the last election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the domestic intelligence service called the npd a " threat to constitutional order " an ideological divide underlying the npd 's current problems is an ongoing ideological divide between different factions of the party .
one side wants to promote a more moderate form of right-wing conservatism in order to attract a broader support base , but the other side wants to maintain links with groups considered more radical and potentially violent .
richard stoess says this second faction of the npd believes the party is too meek and too much a part of the existing political system .

the order from the german parliament came after party treasurer erwin keman was jailed last year for siphoning off hundreds of thousands of euros for his own company .
the npd is appealing the fine , but if the appeal fails , the party will be on the brink of financial ruin and will be lacking the funds it needs to campaign for the upcoming federal and state elections .
the accounting scandal has caused tension within the party and has weakened the authority of its leader udo voigt .
despite this , voigt still managed to win a recent leadership challenge by udo pastoers , the npd leader in the mecklenburg-western pomerania state parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt has led the party since 1996 richard stoess , an expert on the npd from berlin 's free university , says the recent internal conflict shows that there is much criticism of voigt 's leadership .
" but the criticism is not so strong that they would dump the party leadership and vote another person into the position , " says stoess .
a boost from the financial crisis the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , but some analysts believe that the global financial crisis may in fact boost support for the far-right .
there are fears that if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil , then voters will turn to the npd .
voigt showed himself confident his party will do well in state elections later this year , despite its financial problems .
" i think we 've got good chances in three state parliaments , " he said .
the npd is currently represented in two states : saxony with eight representatives and mecklenburg-western pomerania with six .
the party is expected to do well again in the upcoming elections .
the npd could also win the five percent required to gain representation in the state of thuringia .
german voters also head to the polls in september for the federal election .
the npd has so far failed in its attempt to enter federal parliament , winning only 1.6 percent at the last election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the domestic intelligence service called the npd a " threat to constitutional order " an ideological divide underlying the npd 's current problems is an ongoing ideological divide between different factions of the party .
one side wants to promote a more moderate form of right-wing conservatism in order to attract a broader support base , but the other side wants to maintain links with groups considered more radical and potentially violent .
richard stoess says this second faction of the npd believes the party is too meek and too much a part of the existing political system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.04.2009 gordon bajnai elected as hungary 's new prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon bajnai sees himself as a crisis manager hungary 's new prime minister plans to immediately introduce austerity measures and economic reforms and demand sacrifices from many hungarians , including cuts to pensions and public sector pay . in tuesday 's ballot , 204 deputies in the 386-seat parliament voted in favor of bajnai , 41 , to become hungary 's new prime minister .
he will take over from socialist ferenc gyurcsany , who resigned on march 21 .
gyurcsany said last month that a new interim government and a new prime minister were needed to turn the country 's economy around .
hungary is suffering its deepest economic crisis in nearly 20 years and has been one of the countries in eastern europe worst hit by the financial and economic crisis .
financial meltdown was averted only by a massive bailout package of international organizations last october .
managing the crisis without playing politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police kept demonstrators calling for early elections at bay bajnai , a wealthy businessman with no party affiliation , describes himself as " a crisis manager without political ambition . "
immediately after tuesday 's vote , he unveiled his new cabinet , which includes six new ministers .
he said they were experts who , like himself , were free of party affiliations and would take over the key portfolios of finance , economy , social welfare and energy .
bajnai was nominated after nine days of negotiations between the socialists and the small liberal opposition free democrats party .
center-right party wants early elections , not bajnai hungary 's largest opposition group , the center-right fidesz party , did not participate in tuesday 's vote and has labeled the proposed interim government as " illegitimate . "

" we have to stop because we need to look after the lives of our supporters , " said jatuporn prompan , one of the leaders of the red-shirted protesters loyal to former premier shinawatra who still commands widespread loyalty among the rural poor .
" we need to save the lives of every innocent citizen who aimed at nothing but to bring back democracy to the country , " said veera musikapong , another protest leader , in a statement . thai police also said that four protest leaders , who had led the rioting , had voluntarily turned themselves in .
police said the four had been taken into custody for questioning .
protesters had been camped at the government building for three weeks before an army crackdown started before dawn in bangkok on monday , and when violence flared two people were left dead and more than 100 wounded , including at least 23 soldiers .
fear of reprisals brings protests to a close protest leaders were fearful that " right-wing thugs " would sweep in behind the troops to take revenge on their political rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters feared reprisals from the military and hard-liners the opposition accused certain hard-line members of the government of organizing " thugs " to attack protesters last week .
the rival yellow shirts , who helped bring down a pro-thaksin government last year , had also threatened to reform and attack the pro-thaksin demonstrators .
jakrapob penkair , a red-shirt strategist , said with so many " goons and gangsters " lurking around , there might even be a replay of the october 6 , 1976 massacre of student demonstrators carried out by mobs of right-wing activists .
the ' red shirts ' vowed to return , however .
" this is not the end .
we 'll be back .
our leaders will meet after songkran to discuss our next move , " one protest leader , nattawut saikuar , told reuters .
there was deep disappointment on the faces of protesters - whose numbers hit 100,000 last week but dwindled to only a few thousand tuesday - who managed to rock the government and shock the country . public opinion turns against thaksin supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shinawatra retains support - but not everyone is a fan many bangkok residents are angry with the protesters - many of whom came from far outside the capital - for setting fire to buses and threatening to explode gas trucks near homes in the cause of a man many in the capital see as deeply corrupt . many thais appeared stunned by the breakdown of law and order that threatened when the security forces appeared unable or unwilling to restrain the red-shirted protestors . on saturday a group of red-shirt protestors deeply embarrassed prime minister abhisit vejjajiva and the military by invading a 16-nation asian summit being hosted by thailand at the seaside resort city of pattaya , causing it to be cancelled . abhisit told reporters he would not negotiate with thaksin .
" we want peace .
we want to violence to stop .
and then we must work and talk to bring stability and happiness to the country , " he said in brief remarks tuesday morning . thaksin has incited his supporters to " revolution " and " historical change " in almost nightly addresses to the protesters via video link or phone from exile abroad .
he faces a two-year prison sentence for corruption if he returns to thailand . the protesters want the government to resign to hold fresh elections which thaksin , with his big rural support , might still win . abhisit 's democrat party gained power four months ago after the military and bureaucracy disabled pro-thaksin governments and a parliamentary faction defected to the democrats from the thaksin camp . nda / gb / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.04.2009 german far-right party faces internal conflict and financial ruin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is considered by many as a successor of the nazi party after an embezzlement scandal and continued in-fighting at germany 's extreme right npd political party , questions have been raised about its future , particularly in a major election year . germany 's national democratic party has until may 1 to come up with 2.2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- to pay a fine for accounting irregularities .
the order from the german parliament came after party treasurer erwin keman was jailed last year for siphoning off hundreds of thousands of euros for his own company .
the npd is appealing the fine , but if the appeal fails , the party will be on the brink of financial ruin and will be lacking the funds it needs to campaign for the upcoming federal and state elections .
the accounting scandal has caused tension within the party and has weakened the authority of its leader udo voigt .
despite this , voigt still managed to win a recent leadership challenge by udo pastoers , the npd leader in the mecklenburg-western pomerania state parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt has led the party since 1996 richard stoess , an expert on the npd from berlin 's free university , says the recent internal conflict shows that there is much criticism of voigt 's leadership .
" but the criticism is not so strong that they would dump the party leadership and vote another person into the position , " says stoess .
a boost from the financial crisis the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , but some analysts believe that the global financial crisis may in fact boost support for the far-right .
there are fears that if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil , then voters will turn to the npd .
voigt showed himself confident his party will do well in state elections later this year , despite its financial problems .
" i think we 've got good chances in three state parliaments , " he said .
the npd is currently represented in two states : saxony with eight representatives and mecklenburg-western pomerania with six .
the party is expected to do well again in the upcoming elections .
the npd could also win the five percent required to gain representation in the state of thuringia .
german voters also head to the polls in september for the federal election .
the npd has so far failed in its attempt to enter federal parliament , winning only 1.6 percent at the last election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the domestic intelligence service called the npd a " threat to constitutional order " an ideological divide underlying the npd 's current problems is an ongoing ideological divide between different factions of the party .
one side wants to promote a more moderate form of right-wing conservatism in order to attract a broader support base , but the other side wants to maintain links with groups considered more radical and potentially violent .
richard stoess says this second faction of the npd believes the party is too meek and too much a part of the existing political system .
" they say it has to become more revolutionary and more nationalistic and that it should align itself more closely with independent groups and with the neo-nazis , " stoess says . ca / jen , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

but with elections due in september , that could change . the german government is planning to hold another national economic summit in the chancellery next week , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper . however , the paper said a government spokesman stressed that wednesday 's meeting was not about drawing up a third economic stimulus package but rather about assessing the impact of the two aid packages already implemented .
chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who head the government 's two main coalition parties , the christian democrats and the social democrats respectively , want to use the berlin meeting to assess the current economic situation in germany and discuss potential future developments , the sueddeutsche said .
the gathering in the german capital was expected to draw about 40 top representatives from key business and industry sectors as well as trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has ruled out a third stimulus package the results of the talks are to be included in the government 's new growth forecast , which is to be released at the end of april .
the last government forecast envisaged an economic decline of 2.25 percent , but finance minister peer steinbrueck said in march that due to the severe economic slump registered in the first quarter this forecast was probably too optimistic .
industrial production fell by 2.9 percent in february and a recent slump in orders pointed to further weakness in output in the coming weeks , the economy ministry said .
unemployment in february was 7.4 percent , up 0.1 points from january but 0.2 points lower than in february 2008 .
analysts now fear that the german economy could shrink by up to 4.5 percent accompanied by rising unemployment figures exceeding a total of four million .
unions demand third stimulus package in view of the weak economic data , the head of german service sector union verdi , frank bsirske , has urged the government to provide an additional 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 134 billion -rrb- in stimulus spending to prop up europe 's largest economy .
however , finance minister steinbrueck has rejected a third stimulus plan , saying it was necessary to first see the results of the first two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues are likely to dominate federal elections in september the last economic summit in the chancellery took place just before christmas .
after that meeting the government decided to add another 50 billion to its planned 30 billion euro stimulus package over two years to support the ailing economy . government circles have so far been reticent to raise the prospect of extra stimulus spending just yet , however , the issue is likely to dominate this year 's campaigning for federal elections , especially since the ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats is looking to split after the september vote . nk / ncy , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.04.2009 german far-right party faces internal conflict and financial ruin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is considered by many as a successor of the nazi party after an embezzlement scandal and continued in-fighting at germany 's extreme right npd political party , questions have been raised about its future , particularly in a major election year . germany 's national democratic party has until may 1 to come up with 2.2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- to pay a fine for accounting irregularities .
the order from the german parliament came after party treasurer erwin keman was jailed last year for siphoning off hundreds of thousands of euros for his own company .
the npd is appealing the fine , but if the appeal fails , the party will be on the brink of financial ruin and will be lacking the funds it needs to campaign for the upcoming federal and state elections .
the accounting scandal has caused tension within the party and has weakened the authority of its leader udo voigt .
despite this , voigt still managed to win a recent leadership challenge by udo pastoers , the npd leader in the mecklenburg-western pomerania state parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt has led the party since 1996 richard stoess , an expert on the npd from berlin 's free university , says the recent internal conflict shows that there is much criticism of voigt 's leadership .
" but the criticism is not so strong that they would dump the party leadership and vote another person into the position , " says stoess .
a boost from the financial crisis the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , but some analysts believe that the global financial crisis may in fact boost support for the far-right .
there are fears that if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil , then voters will turn to the npd .
voigt showed himself confident his party will do well in state elections later this year , despite its financial problems .
" i think we 've got good chances in three state parliaments , " he said .
the npd is currently represented in two states : saxony with eight representatives and mecklenburg-western pomerania with six .
the party is expected to do well again in the upcoming elections .
the npd could also win the five percent required to gain representation in the state of thuringia .
german voters also head to the polls in september for the federal election .
the npd has so far failed in its attempt to enter federal parliament , winning only 1.6 percent at the last election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the domestic intelligence service called the npd a " threat to constitutional order " an ideological divide underlying the npd 's current problems is an ongoing ideological divide between different factions of the party .
one side wants to promote a more moderate form of right-wing conservatism in order to attract a broader support base , but the other side wants to maintain links with groups considered more radical and potentially violent .
richard stoess says this second faction of the npd believes the party is too meek and too much a part of the existing political system .
" they say it has to become more revolutionary and more nationalistic and that it should align itself more closely with independent groups and with the neo-nazis , " stoess says . ca / jen , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt has led the party since 1996 richard stoess , an expert on the npd from berlin 's free university , says the recent internal conflict shows that there is much criticism of voigt 's leadership .
" but the criticism is not so strong that they would dump the party leadership and vote another person into the position , " says stoess .
a boost from the financial crisis the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , but some analysts believe that the global financial crisis may in fact boost support for the far-right .
there are fears that if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil , then voters will turn to the npd .
voigt showed himself confident his party will do well in state elections later this year , despite its financial problems .
" i think we 've got good chances in three state parliaments , " he said .
the npd is currently represented in two states : saxony with eight representatives and mecklenburg-western pomerania with six .
the party is expected to do well again in the upcoming elections .
the npd could also win the five percent required to gain representation in the state of thuringia .
german voters also head to the polls in september for the federal election .
the npd has so far failed in its attempt to enter federal parliament , winning only 1.6 percent at the last election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the domestic intelligence service called the npd a " threat to constitutional order " an ideological divide underlying the npd 's current problems is an ongoing ideological divide between different factions of the party .
one side wants to promote a more moderate form of right-wing conservatism in order to attract a broader support base , but the other side wants to maintain links with groups considered more radical and potentially violent .
richard stoess says this second faction of the npd believes the party is too meek and too much a part of the existing political system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.04.2009 german far-right party faces internal conflict and financial ruin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is considered by many as a successor of the nazi party after an embezzlement scandal and continued in-fighting at germany 's extreme right npd political party , questions have been raised about its future , particularly in a major election year . germany 's national democratic party has until may 1 to come up with 2.2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- to pay a fine for accounting irregularities .
the order from the german parliament came after party treasurer erwin keman was jailed last year for siphoning off hundreds of thousands of euros for his own company .
the npd is appealing the fine , but if the appeal fails , the party will be on the brink of financial ruin and will be lacking the funds it needs to campaign for the upcoming federal and state elections .
the accounting scandal has caused tension within the party and has weakened the authority of its leader udo voigt .
despite this , voigt still managed to win a recent leadership challenge by udo pastoers , the npd leader in the mecklenburg-western pomerania state parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt has led the party since 1996 richard stoess , an expert on the npd from berlin 's free university , says the recent internal conflict shows that there is much criticism of voigt 's leadership .
" but the criticism is not so strong that they would dump the party leadership and vote another person into the position , " says stoess .
a boost from the financial crisis the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , but some analysts believe that the global financial crisis may in fact boost support for the far-right .
there are fears that if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil , then voters will turn to the npd .
voigt showed himself confident his party will do well in state elections later this year , despite its financial problems .
" i think we 've got good chances in three state parliaments , " he said .
the npd is currently represented in two states : saxony with eight representatives and mecklenburg-western pomerania with six .
the party is expected to do well again in the upcoming elections .
the npd could also win the five percent required to gain representation in the state of thuringia .
german voters also head to the polls in september for the federal election .
the npd has so far failed in its attempt to enter federal parliament , winning only 1.6 percent at the last election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the domestic intelligence service called the npd a " threat to constitutional order " an ideological divide underlying the npd 's current problems is an ongoing ideological divide between different factions of the party .
one side wants to promote a more moderate form of right-wing conservatism in order to attract a broader support base , but the other side wants to maintain links with groups considered more radical and potentially violent .
richard stoess says this second faction of the npd believes the party is too meek and too much a part of the existing political system .
" they say it has to become more revolutionary and more nationalistic and that it should align itself more closely with independent groups and with the neo-nazis , " stoess says . ca / jen , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

" " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who head the government 's two main coalition parties , the christian democrats and the social democrats respectively , want to use the berlin meeting to assess the current economic situation in germany and discuss potential future developments , the sueddeutsche said .
the gathering in the german capital was expected to draw about 40 top representatives from key business and industry sectors as well as trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has ruled out a third stimulus package the results of the talks are to be included in the government 's new growth forecast , which is to be released at the end of april .
the last government forecast envisaged an economic decline of 2.25 percent , but finance minister peer steinbrueck said in march that due to the severe economic slump registered in the first quarter this forecast was probably too optimistic .
industrial production fell by 2.9 percent in february and a recent slump in orders pointed to further weakness in output in the coming weeks , the economy ministry said .
unemployment in february was 7.4 percent , up 0.1 points from january but 0.2 points lower than in february 2008 .
analysts now fear that the german economy could shrink by up to 4.5 percent accompanied by rising unemployment figures exceeding a total of four million .
unions demand third stimulus package in view of the weak economic data , the head of german service sector union verdi , frank bsirske , has urged the government to provide an additional 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 134 billion -rrb- in stimulus spending to prop up europe 's largest economy .
however , finance minister steinbrueck has rejected a third stimulus plan , saying it was necessary to first see the results of the first two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues are likely to dominate federal elections in september the last economic summit in the chancellery took place just before christmas .
after that meeting the government decided to add another 50 billion to its planned 30 billion euro stimulus package over two years to support the ailing economy . government circles have so far been reticent to raise the prospect of extra stimulus spending just yet , however , the issue is likely to dominate this year 's campaigning for federal elections , especially since the ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats is looking to split after the september vote . nk / ncy , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 14.04.2009 germany to ban us biotech giant 's genetically modified corn strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears over gm corn 's effects on the food chain have led to the ban germany has decided to ban genetically modified corn , agriculture minister ilse aigner announced tuesday , amid concerns over its environmental and economical impact . aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 after considering a number of studies .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.04.2009 german far-right party faces internal conflict and financial ruin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is considered by many as a successor of the nazi party after an embezzlement scandal and continued in-fighting at germany 's extreme right npd political party , questions have been raised about its future , particularly in a major election year . germany 's national democratic party has until may 1 to come up with 2.2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- to pay a fine for accounting irregularities .
the order from the german parliament came after party treasurer erwin keman was jailed last year for siphoning off hundreds of thousands of euros for his own company .
the npd is appealing the fine , but if the appeal fails , the party will be on the brink of financial ruin and will be lacking the funds it needs to campaign for the upcoming federal and state elections .
the accounting scandal has caused tension within the party and has weakened the authority of its leader udo voigt .
despite this , voigt still managed to win a recent leadership challenge by udo pastoers , the npd leader in the mecklenburg-western pomerania state parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt has led the party since 1996 richard stoess , an expert on the npd from berlin 's free university , says the recent internal conflict shows that there is much criticism of voigt 's leadership .
" but the criticism is not so strong that they would dump the party leadership and vote another person into the position , " says stoess .
a boost from the financial crisis the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , but some analysts believe that the global financial crisis may in fact boost support for the far-right .
there are fears that if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil , then voters will turn to the npd .
voigt showed himself confident his party will do well in state elections later this year , despite its financial problems .
" i think we 've got good chances in three state parliaments , " he said .
the npd is currently represented in two states : saxony with eight representatives and mecklenburg-western pomerania with six .
the party is expected to do well again in the upcoming elections .
the npd could also win the five percent required to gain representation in the state of thuringia .
german voters also head to the polls in september for the federal election .
the npd has so far failed in its attempt to enter federal parliament , winning only 1.6 percent at the last election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the domestic intelligence service called the npd a " threat to constitutional order " an ideological divide underlying the npd 's current problems is an ongoing ideological divide between different factions of the party .
one side wants to promote a more moderate form of right-wing conservatism in order to attract a broader support base , but the other side wants to maintain links with groups considered more radical and potentially violent .
richard stoess says this second faction of the npd believes the party is too meek and too much a part of the existing political system .
" they say it has to become more revolutionary and more nationalistic and that it should align itself more closely with independent groups and with the neo-nazis , " stoess says . ca / jen , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the order from the german parliament came after party treasurer erwin keman was jailed last year for siphoning off hundreds of thousands of euros for his own company .
the npd is appealing the fine , but if the appeal fails , the party will be on the brink of financial ruin and will be lacking the funds it needs to campaign for the upcoming federal and state elections .
the accounting scandal has caused tension within the party and has weakened the authority of its leader udo voigt .
despite this , voigt still managed to win a recent leadership challenge by udo pastoers , the npd leader in the mecklenburg-western pomerania state parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt has led the party since 1996 richard stoess , an expert on the npd from berlin 's free university , says the recent internal conflict shows that there is much criticism of voigt 's leadership .
" but the criticism is not so strong that they would dump the party leadership and vote another person into the position , " says stoess .
a boost from the financial crisis the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , but some analysts believe that the global financial crisis may in fact boost support for the far-right .
there are fears that if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil , then voters will turn to the npd .
voigt showed himself confident his party will do well in state elections later this year , despite its financial problems .
" i think we 've got good chances in three state parliaments , " he said .
the npd is currently represented in two states : saxony with eight representatives and mecklenburg-western pomerania with six .
the party is expected to do well again in the upcoming elections .
the npd could also win the five percent required to gain representation in the state of thuringia .
german voters also head to the polls in september for the federal election .
the npd has so far failed in its attempt to enter federal parliament , winning only 1.6 percent at the last election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the domestic intelligence service called the npd a " threat to constitutional order " an ideological divide underlying the npd 's current problems is an ongoing ideological divide between different factions of the party .
one side wants to promote a more moderate form of right-wing conservatism in order to attract a broader support base , but the other side wants to maintain links with groups considered more radical and potentially violent .
richard stoess says this second faction of the npd believes the party is too meek and too much a part of the existing political system .
" they say it has to become more revolutionary and more nationalistic and that it should align itself more closely with independent groups and with the neo-nazis , " stoess says . ca / jen , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 14.04.2009 germany to ban us biotech giant 's genetically modified corn strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears over gm corn 's effects on the food chain have led to the ban germany has decided to ban genetically modified corn , agriculture minister ilse aigner announced tuesday , amid concerns over its environmental and economical impact . aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 after considering a number of studies .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

washington hopes the new measures will induce the communist state to pursue democratic reforms . us president barack obama has issued an executive order that lifts restrictions on cuban americans traveling and sending money back to the communist island as part of a much-anticipated reversal of us policy .
obama also directed his government to look into the possibility of starting regularly scheduled commercial flights to cuba .

us telecommunications companies will be allowed to reach agreements to provide fiber-optic cable and satellite communications in cuba .
although the new measures mark a major us policy shift , they do not eliminate washington 's 47-year-old trade embargo against cuba , and travel restrictions for most non-cuban americans will stay in place . the white house hopes its new approach will encourage cuba 's one-party state , currently led by president raul castro , to start implementing democratic reforms .

" we have to stop because we need to look after the lives of our supporters , " said jatuporn prompan , one of the leaders of the red-shirted protesters loyal to former premier shinawatra who still commands widespread loyalty among the rural poor .
" we need to save the lives of every innocent citizen who aimed at nothing but to bring back democracy to the country , " said veera musikapong , another protest leader , in a statement . thai police also said that four protest leaders , who had led the rioting , had voluntarily turned themselves in .
police said the four had been taken into custody for questioning .
protesters had been camped at the government building for three weeks before an army crackdown started before dawn in bangkok on monday , and when violence flared two people were left dead and more than 100 wounded , including at least 23 soldiers .
fear of reprisals brings protests to a close protest leaders were fearful that " right-wing thugs " would sweep in behind the troops to take revenge on their political rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters feared reprisals from the military and hard-liners the opposition accused certain hard-line members of the government of organizing " thugs " to attack protesters last week .

jakrapob penkair , a red-shirt strategist , said with so many " goons and gangsters " lurking around , there might even be a replay of the october 6 , 1976 massacre of student demonstrators carried out by mobs of right-wing activists .
the ' red shirts ' vowed to return , however .
" this is not the end .
we 'll be back .
our leaders will meet after songkran to discuss our next move , " one protest leader , nattawut saikuar , told reuters .
there was deep disappointment on the faces of protesters - whose numbers hit 100,000 last week but dwindled to only a few thousand tuesday - who managed to rock the government and shock the country . public opinion turns against thaksin supporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shinawatra retains support - but not everyone is a fan many bangkok residents are angry with the protesters - many of whom came from far outside the capital - for setting fire to buses and threatening to explode gas trucks near homes in the cause of a man many in the capital see as deeply corrupt . many thais appeared stunned by the breakdown of law and order that threatened when the security forces appeared unable or unwilling to restrain the red-shirted protestors . on saturday a group of red-shirt protestors deeply embarrassed prime minister abhisit vejjajiva and the military by invading a 16-nation asian summit being hosted by thailand at the seaside resort city of pattaya , causing it to be cancelled . abhisit told reporters he would not negotiate with thaksin .
" we want peace .
we want to violence to stop .
and then we must work and talk to bring stability and happiness to the country , " he said in brief remarks tuesday morning . thaksin has incited his supporters to " revolution " and " historical change " in almost nightly addresses to the protesters via video link or phone from exile abroad .
he faces a two-year prison sentence for corruption if he returns to thailand . the protesters want the government to resign to hold fresh elections which thaksin , with his big rural support , might still win . abhisit 's democrat party gained power four months ago after the military and bureaucracy disabled pro-thaksin governments and a parliamentary faction defected to the democrats from the thaksin camp . nda / gb / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 14.04.2009 germany to ban us biotech giant 's genetically modified corn strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears over gm corn 's effects on the food chain have led to the ban germany has decided to ban genetically modified corn , agriculture minister ilse aigner announced tuesday , amid concerns over its environmental and economical impact . aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 after considering a number of studies .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , however , the bandits have pledged to retaliate for their five cohorts who were killed by u.s. and french forces in two separate hostage rescues over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crew members celebrate on the deck of the maersk alabama after their captain was released three pirates were shot in a spectacular us military operation that rescued american richard phillips , captain of the maersk alabama , and two others were killed during the rescue of a french yacht . somali pirates currently hold more than a dozen ships the latest releases and hijackings bring to at least 12 the number of ships being held by somali pirates and to more than 200 the number of crewmen held hostage . among them is the german freighter hansa stavanger , a 20,000-ton container vessel that was hijacked on april 4 with five seamen from germany and 19 from other nations .
the german foreign ministry ’ s crisis squad is working toward their release . while the german defense ministry does not believe the pirates will take revenge on the german hostages , senior official thomas kossendey told deutschlandfunk german radio that the rescue operations have worsened the situation . he warned that the fight against pirates in the region can only be successful if the international community takes steps to improve the political situation in somalia , where nearly two decades of war and lawlessness have made piracy one of the few viable businesses . the pirates ’ relentless attacks have not only disrupted one of the world 's busiest maritime trade routes ; they have made international aid shipments for somalia more difficult .
according to the un world food program in geneva , about 90 percent of supplies are brought to the country by sea . db / jen , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington hopes the new measures will induce the communist state to pursue democratic reforms . us president barack obama has issued an executive order that lifts restrictions on cuban americans traveling and sending money back to the communist island as part of a much-anticipated reversal of us policy .
obama also directed his government to look into the possibility of starting regularly scheduled commercial flights to cuba .

obama 's executive order calls for more humanitarian donations to be sent to cuba as well as expanded communications links .
us telecommunications companies will be allowed to reach agreements to provide fiber-optic cable and satellite communications in cuba .

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .

" we have to stop because we need to look after the lives of our supporters , " said jatuporn prompan , one of the leaders of the red-shirted protesters loyal to former premier shinawatra who still commands widespread loyalty among the rural poor .
" we need to save the lives of every innocent citizen who aimed at nothing but to bring back democracy to the country , " said veera musikapong , another protest leader , in a statement . thai police also said that four protest leaders , who had led the rioting , had voluntarily turned themselves in .
police said the four had been taken into custody for questioning .
protesters had been camped at the government building for three weeks before an army crackdown started before dawn in bangkok on monday , and when violence flared two people were left dead and more than 100 wounded , including at least 23 soldiers .

they also hijacked two egyptian fishing boats . somali pirates have so far never executed hostages , but have sought to release ships in exchange for ransoms .

the german foreign ministry ’ s crisis squad is working toward their release . while the german defense ministry does not believe the pirates will take revenge on the german hostages , senior official thomas kossendey told deutschlandfunk german radio that the rescue operations have worsened the situation . he warned that the fight against pirates in the region can only be successful if the international community takes steps to improve the political situation in somalia , where nearly two decades of war and lawlessness have made piracy one of the few viable businesses . the pirates ’ relentless attacks have not only disrupted one of the world 's busiest maritime trade routes ; they have made international aid shipments for somalia more difficult .

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .

commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone .

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .

he will take over from socialist ferenc gyurcsany , who resigned on march 21 .
gyurcsany said last month that a new interim government and a new prime minister were needed to turn the country 's economy around .
hungary is suffering its deepest economic crisis in nearly 20 years and has been one of the countries in eastern europe worst hit by the financial and economic crisis .
financial meltdown was averted only by a massive bailout package of international organizations last october .
managing the crisis without playing politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police kept demonstrators calling for early elections at bay bajnai , a wealthy businessman with no party affiliation , describes himself as " a crisis manager without political ambition . "
immediately after tuesday 's vote , he unveiled his new cabinet , which includes six new ministers .
he said they were experts who , like himself , were free of party affiliations and would take over the key portfolios of finance , economy , social welfare and energy .
bajnai was nominated after nine days of negotiations between the socialists and the small liberal opposition free democrats party .
center-right party wants early elections , not bajnai hungary 's largest opposition group , the center-right fidesz party , did not participate in tuesday 's vote and has labeled the proposed interim government as " illegitimate . "
it is demanding that elections be brought forward from spring 2010 .
bajnai warned that elections are not the answer .
" as long as the majority of mps support a government 's austerity program , a crisis-management government is a better solution for hungary than early elections , " he said .

he will take over from socialist ferenc gyurcsany , who resigned on march 21 .
gyurcsany said last month that a new interim government and a new prime minister were needed to turn the country 's economy around .
hungary is suffering its deepest economic crisis in nearly 20 years and has been one of the countries in eastern europe worst hit by the financial and economic crisis .
financial meltdown was averted only by a massive bailout package of international organizations last october .
managing the crisis without playing politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police kept demonstrators calling for early elections at bay bajnai , a wealthy businessman with no party affiliation , describes himself as " a crisis manager without political ambition . "
immediately after tuesday 's vote , he unveiled his new cabinet , which includes six new ministers .
he said they were experts who , like himself , were free of party affiliations and would take over the key portfolios of finance , economy , social welfare and energy .
bajnai was nominated after nine days of negotiations between the socialists and the small liberal opposition free democrats party .
center-right party wants early elections , not bajnai hungary 's largest opposition group , the center-right fidesz party , did not participate in tuesday 's vote and has labeled the proposed interim government as " illegitimate . "
it is demanding that elections be brought forward from spring 2010 .
bajnai warned that elections are not the answer .
" as long as the majority of mps support a government 's austerity program , a crisis-management government is a better solution for hungary than early elections , " he said .
bajnai has said he would not delay in introducing austerity measures and economic reforms and that this would require sacrifices from many hungarians .
bajnai 's planned austerity measures are likely to include cuts to pensions and public service employee salaries . wl / jen , afp / dpa / reu send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also hijacked two egyptian fishing boats . somali pirates have so far never executed hostages , but have sought to release ships in exchange for ransoms .
now , however , the bandits have pledged to retaliate for their five cohorts who were killed by u.s. and french forces in two separate hostage rescues over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crew members celebrate on the deck of the maersk alabama after their captain was released three pirates were shot in a spectacular us military operation that rescued american richard phillips , captain of the maersk alabama , and two others were killed during the rescue of a french yacht . somali pirates currently hold more than a dozen ships the latest releases and hijackings bring to at least 12 the number of ships being held by somali pirates and to more than 200 the number of crewmen held hostage . among them is the german freighter hansa stavanger , a 20,000-ton container vessel that was hijacked on april 4 with five seamen from germany and 19 from other nations .
the german foreign ministry ’ s crisis squad is working toward their release . while the german defense ministry does not believe the pirates will take revenge on the german hostages , senior official thomas kossendey told deutschlandfunk german radio that the rescue operations have worsened the situation . he warned that the fight against pirates in the region can only be successful if the international community takes steps to improve the political situation in somalia , where nearly two decades of war and lawlessness have made piracy one of the few viable businesses . the pirates ’ relentless attacks have not only disrupted one of the world 's busiest maritime trade routes ; they have made international aid shipments for somalia more difficult .

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

but with elections due in september , that could change . the german government is planning to hold another national economic summit in the chancellery next week , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper . however , the paper said a government spokesman stressed that wednesday 's meeting was not about drawing up a third economic stimulus package but rather about assessing the impact of the two aid packages already implemented .
chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who head the government 's two main coalition parties , the christian democrats and the social democrats respectively , want to use the berlin meeting to assess the current economic situation in germany and discuss potential future developments , the sueddeutsche said .
the gathering in the german capital was expected to draw about 40 top representatives from key business and industry sectors as well as trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has ruled out a third stimulus package the results of the talks are to be included in the government 's new growth forecast , which is to be released at the end of april .
the last government forecast envisaged an economic decline of 2.25 percent , but finance minister peer steinbrueck said in march that due to the severe economic slump registered in the first quarter this forecast was probably too optimistic .
industrial production fell by 2.9 percent in february and a recent slump in orders pointed to further weakness in output in the coming weeks , the economy ministry said .
unemployment in february was 7.4 percent , up 0.1 points from january but 0.2 points lower than in february 2008 .
analysts now fear that the german economy could shrink by up to 4.5 percent accompanied by rising unemployment figures exceeding a total of four million .
unions demand third stimulus package in view of the weak economic data , the head of german service sector union verdi , frank bsirske , has urged the government to provide an additional 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 134 billion -rrb- in stimulus spending to prop up europe 's largest economy .
however , finance minister steinbrueck has rejected a third stimulus plan , saying it was necessary to first see the results of the first two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues are likely to dominate federal elections in september the last economic summit in the chancellery took place just before christmas .
after that meeting the government decided to add another 50 billion to its planned 30 billion euro stimulus package over two years to support the ailing economy . government circles have so far been reticent to raise the prospect of extra stimulus spending just yet , however , the issue is likely to dominate this year 's campaigning for federal elections , especially since the ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats is looking to split after the september vote . nk / ncy , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 14.04.2009 germany to ban us biotech giant 's genetically modified corn strain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears over gm corn 's effects on the food chain have led to the ban germany has decided to ban genetically modified corn , agriculture minister ilse aigner announced tuesday , amid concerns over its environmental and economical impact . aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 after considering a number of studies .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de austria , hungary allowed to keep ban on genetically modified crops germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , has voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn .

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.04.2009 german far-right party faces internal conflict and financial ruin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is considered by many as a successor of the nazi party after an embezzlement scandal and continued in-fighting at germany 's extreme right npd political party , questions have been raised about its future , particularly in a major election year . germany 's national democratic party has until may 1 to come up with 2.2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- to pay a fine for accounting irregularities .
the order from the german parliament came after party treasurer erwin keman was jailed last year for siphoning off hundreds of thousands of euros for his own company .
the npd is appealing the fine , but if the appeal fails , the party will be on the brink of financial ruin and will be lacking the funds it needs to campaign for the upcoming federal and state elections .
the accounting scandal has caused tension within the party and has weakened the authority of its leader udo voigt .
despite this , voigt still managed to win a recent leadership challenge by udo pastoers , the npd leader in the mecklenburg-western pomerania state parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt has led the party since 1996 richard stoess , an expert on the npd from berlin 's free university , says the recent internal conflict shows that there is much criticism of voigt 's leadership .
" but the criticism is not so strong that they would dump the party leadership and vote another person into the position , " says stoess .
a boost from the financial crisis the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , but some analysts believe that the global financial crisis may in fact boost support for the far-right .
there are fears that if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil , then voters will turn to the npd .
voigt showed himself confident his party will do well in state elections later this year , despite its financial problems .
" i think we 've got good chances in three state parliaments , " he said .
the npd is currently represented in two states : saxony with eight representatives and mecklenburg-western pomerania with six .
the party is expected to do well again in the upcoming elections .
the npd could also win the five percent required to gain representation in the state of thuringia .
german voters also head to the polls in september for the federal election .
the npd has so far failed in its attempt to enter federal parliament , winning only 1.6 percent at the last election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the domestic intelligence service called the npd a " threat to constitutional order " an ideological divide underlying the npd 's current problems is an ongoing ideological divide between different factions of the party .

the order from the german parliament came after party treasurer erwin keman was jailed last year for siphoning off hundreds of thousands of euros for his own company .
the npd is appealing the fine , but if the appeal fails , the party will be on the brink of financial ruin and will be lacking the funds it needs to campaign for the upcoming federal and state elections .
the accounting scandal has caused tension within the party and has weakened the authority of its leader udo voigt .
despite this , voigt still managed to win a recent leadership challenge by udo pastoers , the npd leader in the mecklenburg-western pomerania state parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt has led the party since 1996 richard stoess , an expert on the npd from berlin 's free university , says the recent internal conflict shows that there is much criticism of voigt 's leadership .
" but the criticism is not so strong that they would dump the party leadership and vote another person into the position , " says stoess .
a boost from the financial crisis the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , but some analysts believe that the global financial crisis may in fact boost support for the far-right .
there are fears that if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil , then voters will turn to the npd .
voigt showed himself confident his party will do well in state elections later this year , despite its financial problems .
" i think we 've got good chances in three state parliaments , " he said .
the npd is currently represented in two states : saxony with eight representatives and mecklenburg-western pomerania with six .
the party is expected to do well again in the upcoming elections .
the npd could also win the five percent required to gain representation in the state of thuringia .
german voters also head to the polls in september for the federal election .
the npd has so far failed in its attempt to enter federal parliament , winning only 1.6 percent at the last election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the domestic intelligence service called the npd a " threat to constitutional order " an ideological divide underlying the npd 's current problems is an ongoing ideological divide between different factions of the party .

washington hopes the new measures will induce the communist state to pursue democratic reforms . us president barack obama has issued an executive order that lifts restrictions on cuban americans traveling and sending money back to the communist island as part of a much-anticipated reversal of us policy .

although the new measures mark a major us policy shift , they do not eliminate washington 's 47-year-old trade embargo against cuba , and travel restrictions for most non-cuban americans will stay in place . the white house hopes its new approach will encourage cuba 's one-party state , currently led by president raul castro , to start implementing democratic reforms .

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks . " " china hopes relevant parties will ... jointly maintain peace and stability of the korean peninsula and northeast asia , and make all efforts to keep promoting the development of the six-party talks , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said . jiang reiterated china 's opposition to any fresh un security council resolution or new sanctions against north korea for its rocket launch . yongbyon reactor likely to go online again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yongbyon site will be restarted as part of the response pyongyang had been disabling plants at yongbyon that produced weapons-grade plutonium as part of a february 2007 six-nation deal . it previously threatened to quit the talks , which began in 2003 , should the security council criticize its april 5 rocket launch . pyongyang 's regime has been trumpeting its success in launching what it termed a peaceful communications satellite . the united states and its allies say no satellite has been detected in orbit and the north 's purpose in any case was to test a long-range missile . the 15-member council condemned the launch , saying it contravenes security council resolution 1718 passed after the north 's 2006 missile and nuclear tests . it agreed to tighten sanctions , which were mandated under resolution 1718 but never enforced amid hopes of progress on denuclearization . japan calls for strong new resolution backed by the united states and its european allies , japan had pressed for a resolution , which carries more weight than a statement . but china and russia urged restraint to avoid harming prospects for resuming the six-party talks , which include the two koreas , china , russia , japan and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket launch set the whole region on edge " even though the six-party talks were blown up by hostile forces and the denuclearization process torn apart , we will take the responsibility of ensuring peace and security on the korean peninsula with the strength of the songun -lrb- military-first -rrb- policy , " the north 's statement said . it said it would actively consider building its own light-water nuclear reactors to supply electrical power and blasted what it called double standards by the world body . " according to the us logic , japan may launch a satellite because japan is its ally , but we must not do the same because we have a different system and we are not subservient to the us , " the ministry statement said .
" the un security council simply yielded to the us robber-like logic . " kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

" kim yong-hyun , a professor at seoul 's dongguk university , said pyongyang 's response raises the possibility of armed provocations . " the strong north korean statement means tension will rise further around the peninsula for a while , " he told afp .
" it raises the possibility of military provocations by north korea . " north korea is ratcheting up the stakes .
its brinkmanship , of course , is designed to win maximum concessions from the us and international community . " professor yang moo-jin of the university of north korean studies said the statement was one of the strongest he remembered from pyongyang . " the statement says the north is now moving to actions .
it 's crucial for the us , its allies and china to react wisely in order to control the situation . "
security council unanimously condemns missile test late on monday , the un security council in new york unanimously condemned north korea for its long-range rocket launch and agreed to enforce existing sanctions against pyongyang .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council was united in its condemnation the 15 council members adopted a compromise statement agreed on by six major powers on saturday .
the statement ordered a un sanctions committee to begin activating financial sanctions and an arms and limited trade embargo laid down in a resolution passed two and a half years ago .
us state department spokesman robert wood said the council measure sends a " very strong and coordinated message " to the north koreans that " this type of activity can not happen again , must n't happen again . "
despite tokyo 's failure to get a resolution over north korea 's rocket launch , japanese ambassador yukio takasu said " japan is very pleased that the security council has adopted unanimously a very strong presidential statement . "
japan had called for emergency council action after pyongyang launched a ballistic taepo-dong 2 missile on april 5 , arguing that the rocket had flown across its territory and was a clear violation of the 2006 resolution that forbade north korea from testing ballistic missiles .
the rocket fell into the pacific ocean after crossing over japanese territory , according to us and japanese officials .
north korea insists it put a satellite into orbit , but no evidence of the orbiter has been found .
in a week of wrestling over the council 's response , the united states and japan had demanded a full-fledged resolution with additional sanctions .
but china and russia , two of the council 's five veto-wielding powers , refused to support tougher measures out of concern it would undermine the long-ongoing six-party talks aimed at getting pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program .
the talks , hosted by china and including the united states , south korea , japan and russia , have been stalled since december last year after pyongyang refused to agree on ways of verifying its claims on nuclear disarmament moves .
un chief ban ki-moon expressed hope in a statement " that the council 's unified response will pave the way for renewed efforts towards the peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues in the region , including through the early resumption of the six-party talks and the inter-korean dialogue .

" there is no need for the six-party -lrb- nuclear disarmament -rrb- talks any more , " said a foreign ministry statement carried by the official korean central news agency .
" we will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks . " the north " will strengthen its nuclear deterrent for its defense by all means , " it said . " we will take steps to restore disabled nuclear facilities ... and reprocess used fuel rods that came from experimental nuclear reactors . " the statement , which analysts described as unusually strong , came just hours after the security council unanimously approved its statement . russia first to offer regret at decision russia 's foreign ministry responded to north korea 's decision to restart its nuclear weapons program with regret , according to a report by state news agency ria novosti on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia regrets north korea 's pledge to re-arm " we can only regret north korea 's decision and call on her not to leave six-party talks on the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula , " ria novosti quoted an unnamed ministry official as saying . china had no immediate comment but in an earlier statement called for the diplomatic effort to continue . responding to the security council 's condemnation of north korea for its april 5 rocket launch , china 's foreign ministry said it wanted all un moves to be " conducive to the six-party talks .

but with elections due in september , that could change . the german government is planning to hold another national economic summit in the chancellery next week , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper . however , the paper said a government spokesman stressed that wednesday 's meeting was not about drawing up a third economic stimulus package but rather about assessing the impact of the two aid packages already implemented .
chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who head the government 's two main coalition parties , the christian democrats and the social democrats respectively , want to use the berlin meeting to assess the current economic situation in germany and discuss potential future developments , the sueddeutsche said .
the gathering in the german capital was expected to draw about 40 top representatives from key business and industry sectors as well as trade unions .

industrial production fell by 2.9 percent in february and a recent slump in orders pointed to further weakness in output in the coming weeks , the economy ministry said .
unemployment in february was 7.4 percent , up 0.1 points from january but 0.2 points lower than in february 2008 .
analysts now fear that the german economy could shrink by up to 4.5 percent accompanied by rising unemployment figures exceeding a total of four million .

after that meeting the government decided to add another 50 billion to its planned 30 billion euro stimulus package over two years to support the ailing economy . government circles have so far been reticent to raise the prospect of extra stimulus spending just yet , however , the issue is likely to dominate this year 's campaigning for federal elections , especially since the ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats is looking to split after the september vote . nk / ncy , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with elections due in september , that could change . the german government is planning to hold another national economic summit in the chancellery next week , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper . however , the paper said a government spokesman stressed that wednesday 's meeting was not about drawing up a third economic stimulus package but rather about assessing the impact of the two aid packages already implemented .
chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who head the government 's two main coalition parties , the christian democrats and the social democrats respectively , want to use the berlin meeting to assess the current economic situation in germany and discuss potential future developments , the sueddeutsche said .
the gathering in the german capital was expected to draw about 40 top representatives from key business and industry sectors as well as trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has ruled out a third stimulus package the results of the talks are to be included in the government 's new growth forecast , which is to be released at the end of april .
the last government forecast envisaged an economic decline of 2.25 percent , but finance minister peer steinbrueck said in march that due to the severe economic slump registered in the first quarter this forecast was probably too optimistic .
industrial production fell by 2.9 percent in february and a recent slump in orders pointed to further weakness in output in the coming weeks , the economy ministry said .
unemployment in february was 7.4 percent , up 0.1 points from january but 0.2 points lower than in february 2008 .
analysts now fear that the german economy could shrink by up to 4.5 percent accompanied by rising unemployment figures exceeding a total of four million .

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crop approved in the european union and was approved for commercial use in the eu in 1998 .
the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- has said the strain of corn was safe despite widespread doubts .
mon 810 seeds are the only genetically modified seed currently allowed on german soil .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
mon 810 includes a gene which protects it against a pest , the european corn borer butterfly .
aigner , who has the support of environmental federations and politicians across party lines , had reviewed several critical studies on the environmental consequences of planting the seed , as well as drawing on a report by monsanto which had declared their product safe .
calls for german-wide ban across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner calls time on gm crops in germany politicians from aigner 's own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as well as from the green party and the left party , have called for a long-term ban on the cultivation of gm crops with bavarian environment secretary markus soeder -lrb- csu -rrb- leading the calls for germany to become a " gm-free zone . "
opponents of gm crops say that they fear the effects the crops may have on the environment and animal life .
they are also concerned that pollen from gm crops could be dispersed far from the land where they are grown , contaminating conventional crops .
europe remains divided on whether gm corn is safe and whether to allow its widespread use across the continent despite it being given a green light by the eu 's executive body to be grown in the block .
the eu in december adopted a series of measures aimed at overcoming the differences and reaching unified decisions .
the member states notably recommended that the efsa should be europe 's final arbiter on the safety of gm crops , but with input from national bodies .
they also agreed that decisions should take into account the medium- and long-term environmental impact of any decision , not just the health aspects .
commission facing on-going mutiny over gm crops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mon 810 is being grown in a number of eu countries however , the european commission has been struggling with a mutiny within the eu where a number of countries have retained bans on the growing of gm crops despite its best efforts to persuade them to comply .
only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only last month , germany , along with at least 20 other eu member states , voted down a european commission attempt to have austria and hungary lift bans on growing maize .
eu environment ministers , meeting in brussels on march 2 , voted against forcing vienna and budapest to allow monsanto 's mon810 gm grain to be grown in their countries .
only four eu nations - britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden - supported the commission 's effort to have the austrian and hungarian bans lifted .
under eu law , member states can legislate a national ban on genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- if the government in question can justify the prohibition .
it was the third time that the commission had tried to force austria to lift its ban , and the second time for hungary .
austria also has a " safeguard " ban on germany 's bayer ag 's t25 gm corn .
both varieties have been approved for use in the eu by the commission , but debate in europe continues over the potential of gm seeds to accidentally spread and adversely affect natural surroundings and adjacent farms .
greens urge vigilance against commission efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is facing stiff opposition in europe the march defeat followed a similar vote in february , which foiled the european commission 's attempts to force france and greece to allow gm corn from monsanto to be grown in their fields .
nine of the 27 eu nations supported the commission 's call for the ban to be lifted , while 16 opposed it or abstained .
monica frassoni , co-leader of the green group in the european parliament , urged vigilance against the commission 's attempt to make member states allow gm crops to be grown .
" we must remain vigilant because it is not the first time that the commission has tried to force the hand of those member states that are most resistant to the growing of genetically modified maize , " she said .
" the challenge now is to secure a majority big enough to reject the commission 's proposal . "
french watchdog contradicts sarkozy on ban only a week before the february vote , france 's food watchdog afssa concluded that genetically-modified corn from monsanto was safe , contradicting an earlier report that had led to a ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government banned gm crops but the watchdog says they 're safe the afssa report , which became public after it was revealed in the daily le figaro , angered environmentalists and embarrassed president nicolas sarkozy 's government , which had resorted to a special eu measure to outlaw the crops .
the agency said there was no evidence to support the view that mon810 posed a health risk .
it was the only strain of gm corn under cultivation in france before the ban .
sarkozy 's government slapped a ban on gm crops in february last year after a panel of experts said in a separate report that they had " serious doubts " about the monsanto product .
france invoked a european union safeguard giving member states authority to ban a gm crop provided there was scientific evidence to back the decision . nda / gb / ncy , afp / ap / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.04.2009 german far-right party faces internal conflict and financial ruin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is considered by many as a successor of the nazi party after an embezzlement scandal and continued in-fighting at germany 's extreme right npd political party , questions have been raised about its future , particularly in a major election year . germany 's national democratic party has until may 1 to come up with 2.2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- to pay a fine for accounting irregularities .
the order from the german parliament came after party treasurer erwin keman was jailed last year for siphoning off hundreds of thousands of euros for his own company .
the npd is appealing the fine , but if the appeal fails , the party will be on the brink of financial ruin and will be lacking the funds it needs to campaign for the upcoming federal and state elections .
the accounting scandal has caused tension within the party and has weakened the authority of its leader udo voigt .
despite this , voigt still managed to win a recent leadership challenge by udo pastoers , the npd leader in the mecklenburg-western pomerania state parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt has led the party since 1996 richard stoess , an expert on the npd from berlin 's free university , says the recent internal conflict shows that there is much criticism of voigt 's leadership .
" but the criticism is not so strong that they would dump the party leadership and vote another person into the position , " says stoess .
a boost from the financial crisis the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , but some analysts believe that the global financial crisis may in fact boost support for the far-right .
there are fears that if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil , then voters will turn to the npd .
voigt showed himself confident his party will do well in state elections later this year , despite its financial problems .
" i think we 've got good chances in three state parliaments , " he said .
the npd is currently represented in two states : saxony with eight representatives and mecklenburg-western pomerania with six .
the party is expected to do well again in the upcoming elections .
the npd could also win the five percent required to gain representation in the state of thuringia .
german voters also head to the polls in september for the federal election .
the npd has so far failed in its attempt to enter federal parliament , winning only 1.6 percent at the last election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the domestic intelligence service called the npd a " threat to constitutional order " an ideological divide underlying the npd 's current problems is an ongoing ideological divide between different factions of the party .
one side wants to promote a more moderate form of right-wing conservatism in order to attract a broader support base , but the other side wants to maintain links with groups considered more radical and potentially violent .
richard stoess says this second faction of the npd believes the party is too meek and too much a part of the existing political system .
" they say it has to become more revolutionary and more nationalistic and that it should align itself more closely with independent groups and with the neo-nazis , " stoess says . ca / jen , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the order from the german parliament came after party treasurer erwin keman was jailed last year for siphoning off hundreds of thousands of euros for his own company .
the npd is appealing the fine , but if the appeal fails , the party will be on the brink of financial ruin and will be lacking the funds it needs to campaign for the upcoming federal and state elections .
the accounting scandal has caused tension within the party and has weakened the authority of its leader udo voigt .
despite this , voigt still managed to win a recent leadership challenge by udo pastoers , the npd leader in the mecklenburg-western pomerania state parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt has led the party since 1996 richard stoess , an expert on the npd from berlin 's free university , says the recent internal conflict shows that there is much criticism of voigt 's leadership .
" but the criticism is not so strong that they would dump the party leadership and vote another person into the position , " says stoess .
a boost from the financial crisis the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , but some analysts believe that the global financial crisis may in fact boost support for the far-right .
there are fears that if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil , then voters will turn to the npd .
voigt showed himself confident his party will do well in state elections later this year , despite its financial problems .
" i think we 've got good chances in three state parliaments , " he said .
the npd is currently represented in two states : saxony with eight representatives and mecklenburg-western pomerania with six .
the party is expected to do well again in the upcoming elections .
the npd could also win the five percent required to gain representation in the state of thuringia .
german voters also head to the polls in september for the federal election .
the npd has so far failed in its attempt to enter federal parliament , winning only 1.6 percent at the last election in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the domestic intelligence service called the npd a " threat to constitutional order " an ideological divide underlying the npd 's current problems is an ongoing ideological divide between different factions of the party .
one side wants to promote a more moderate form of right-wing conservatism in order to attract a broader support base , but the other side wants to maintain links with groups considered more radical and potentially violent .
richard stoess says this second faction of the npd believes the party is too meek and too much a part of the existing political system .

he will take over from socialist ferenc gyurcsany , who resigned on march 21 .
gyurcsany said last month that a new interim government and a new prime minister were needed to turn the country 's economy around .
hungary is suffering its deepest economic crisis in nearly 20 years and has been one of the countries in eastern europe worst hit by the financial and economic crisis .
financial meltdown was averted only by a massive bailout package of international organizations last october .
managing the crisis without playing politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police kept demonstrators calling for early elections at bay bajnai , a wealthy businessman with no party affiliation , describes himself as " a crisis manager without political ambition . "
immediately after tuesday 's vote , he unveiled his new cabinet , which includes six new ministers .
he said they were experts who , like himself , were free of party affiliations and would take over the key portfolios of finance , economy , social welfare and energy .
bajnai was nominated after nine days of negotiations between the socialists and the small liberal opposition free democrats party .
center-right party wants early elections , not bajnai hungary 's largest opposition group , the center-right fidesz party , did not participate in tuesday 's vote and has labeled the proposed interim government as " illegitimate . "
it is demanding that elections be brought forward from spring 2010 .
bajnai warned that elections are not the answer .
" as long as the majority of mps support a government 's austerity program , a crisis-management government is a better solution for hungary than early elections , " he said .
bajnai has said he would not delay in introducing austerity measures and economic reforms and that this would require sacrifices from many hungarians .
bajnai 's planned austerity measures are likely to include cuts to pensions and public service employee salaries . wl / jen , afp / dpa / reu send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also hijacked two egyptian fishing boats . somali pirates have so far never executed hostages , but have sought to release ships in exchange for ransoms .

the german foreign ministry ’ s crisis squad is working toward their release . while the german defense ministry does not believe the pirates will take revenge on the german hostages , senior official thomas kossendey told deutschlandfunk german radio that the rescue operations have worsened the situation . he warned that the fight against pirates in the region can only be successful if the international community takes steps to improve the political situation in somalia , where nearly two decades of war and lawlessness have made piracy one of the few viable businesses . the pirates ’ relentless attacks have not only disrupted one of the world 's busiest maritime trade routes ; they have made international aid shipments for somalia more difficult .

they also hijacked two egyptian fishing boats . somali pirates have so far never executed hostages , but have sought to release ships in exchange for ransoms .
now , however , the bandits have pledged to retaliate for their five cohorts who were killed by u.s. and french forces in two separate hostage rescues over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crew members celebrate on the deck of the maersk alabama after their captain was released three pirates were shot in a spectacular us military operation that rescued american richard phillips , captain of the maersk alabama , and two others were killed during the rescue of a french yacht . somali pirates currently hold more than a dozen ships the latest releases and hijackings bring to at least 12 the number of ships being held by somali pirates and to more than 200 the number of crewmen held hostage . among them is the german freighter hansa stavanger , a 20,000-ton container vessel that was hijacked on april 4 with five seamen from germany and 19 from other nations .
the german foreign ministry ’ s crisis squad is working toward their release . while the german defense ministry does not believe the pirates will take revenge on the german hostages , senior official thomas kossendey told deutschlandfunk german radio that the rescue operations have worsened the situation . he warned that the fight against pirates in the region can only be successful if the international community takes steps to improve the political situation in somalia , where nearly two decades of war and lawlessness have made piracy one of the few viable businesses . the pirates ’ relentless attacks have not only disrupted one of the world 's busiest maritime trade routes ; they have made international aid shipments for somalia more difficult .

they also hijacked two egyptian fishing boats . somali pirates have so far never executed hostages , but have sought to release ships in exchange for ransoms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 14.04.2009 berliners celebrate arrival of spring by trashing park großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were almost as bad as after the love parade easter weekend in the german capital was unseasonably warm and pleasant .
city residents and revelers marked the occasion by depositing 15 tons of garbage in the city 's tiergarten park . a small column of men from the parks authority started cleaning up the rubbish at 6 am on morning of tuesday , april 14 , after hordes of barbeque enthusiasts turned what is sometimes called berlin 's " green lung " into something resembling a cancerous organ .
even some trees were reported damaged .
park officials told the b.z. newspaper it would cost around 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 21,200 -rrb- to restore the park to a semblance of normalcy .
people making a mess in berlin 's public spaces is nothing new , as anyone who has ever witnessed the annual may 1 demonstration-cum-street-riot in the city 's kreuzberg district can attest .
but officials thought they had the situation under control in the tiergarten , after barbeques were restricted to special areas and grilled-meat fanatics were instructed to take their waste with them .
the weather , however , seems to have thrown a monkey wrench into the works .
clearly yearning for release after a winter in which the sun shone for an estimated fifteen minutes per month , and having emptied convenience store shelves of anything that looked remotely edible and / or flammable , hooligans armed with aprons and tongs went on a rampage .
and no one , it seems , was in much of a mind for tidying up .

a report claims newport 's civic centre , its international sports village and schools and community centres can be used to generate renewable energy .
it says capital costs could be recouped within 15 years at current prices with power either sold to the national grid or used to cut a site 's energy bill .
the economic development committee is to vote on wednesday a study .
the report said the best buildings to be part of the solar farm are the ones with a flat or pitched roof facing somewhere between south east and south west .
buildings with a pitched roof with an angle of between 25 and 35 degrees are ideal .
on a flat roof building , the panels would need to be tilted to an angle of around 30 degrees and spaced apart to stop them casting shadows on each other .
' electricity ' the sports village is considered an " ideal location " for an array of photovoltaic panels as the swimming pool roof has an almost perfect orientation and pitch for optimum output .
it has an area of approximately 2,400 sq m with few obstructions and is thought suitable for a direct draw down of energy to contribute to the building 's power use .
the velodrome , with has a flat roof with an area of over 8,500 sq m , is also thought to be best for a direct draw down scheme , although the orientation of the building is not ideal , as the pitch east to west is fairly shallow .
the report said : " from those panels , for example , if the building has a high every-day demand such as a leisure centre , then it would be more advantageous to use the direct produced electricity within the building .
" if the building is for example a school , then it may be more prudent to sell the electricity back to the supplier as the school will be closed for long durations outside of terms , especially during the summer months when electricity production levels are at their peak . "
street lamps it concluded : " the city 's existing , and in some cases iconic , buildings , have great potential to generate renewable energy , through -lsb- photovoltaic -rsb- installations .
one of the options being considered is to make developers supply a photovoltaic solar panel for every one - to-three street lamps installed on new developments .
a solar panel installation has been put on the new community centre in the moorland park area of the city .

oxford circus is one of the most popular destinations in the world , with more than 200m visitors a year .
the redesign will double the amount of pavement and more space will be created around the exits to oxford circus tube station .
as part of the works more than 500m of both regent street and oxford street are being redesigned with wider pavements and new lighting .
the new oxford circus is inspired by tokyo 's shibuya pedestrian crossing the revamped crossing is due to reopen in time for the switching on of the regent street and oxford street christmas lights in november .
it also forms a key part of westminster city council 's plans to renew the west end ahead of london 's olympic games in 2012 .
councillor danny chalkley said : " taking our inspiration from the far east makes perfect sense as the japanese have perfected the art of managing large numbers of people through good design and engineering .
" the west end , like tokyo 's shibuya district , is a fashion and entertainment hub which attracts visitors in huge numbers .
" this new crossing , which will transform oxford circus and ensure visitors who emerge from the tube are impressed by what greets them , is part of a whole series of improvements taking place to ensure the west end looks truly world class in time for 2012 . "

they are also finding symptoms are becoming more severe , causing acute pain and in some cases even death .
many of those afflicted are reported to be children .
staff from specialist clinics in liverpool , cambridge , cardiff , birmingham and london are among those to confirm the rise .
allergy or intolerance ?
an allergy is when the immune system reacts to a harmless substance such as a food or pollen , as if it is n't safe a severe allergy can cause a potentially life threatening shock known as anaphylaxis an intolerance does not affect the immune system an intolerance is generally not life threatening and the symptoms less severe an intolerance is being unable to digest certain foods such as lactose in milk what causes allergies ?
dr jonathan north , a consultant immunologist in birmingham , said : " we used to say that 15 % of the population had an allergy of some sort , now the figure is nearer 40 % .
" as well as the well-documented increase in prevalence , the proportion of complex / multiple allergy cases is increasing . "
the reasons for the rise are not fully understood .
" one of the theories , which i think makes sense as regards food allergy , is that we now have a far wider range of foods available and children are being exposed at a much younger age , " said dr north .
symptoms more severe dr shuaib nasser , a consultant in allergy for the cambridge university nhs trust , has also noted the growth in multiple allergies and is concerned about the increasing severity of allergy symptoms , which can be fatal .
for asthma and hay fever patients , dr nasser says the period of suffering is also getting longer .
" we may think of some allergies as being simply inconvenient but there are patients who die from allergic disorders .
" hay fever is not just a runny nose .
patients develop asthma and are admitted into hospital . "
" i find it is unusual for anyone to have a nut allergy without having eczema " dr shuaib nasser , allergies expert dr nasser has been running an investigation into asthma deaths .
" we have found that asthma deaths peak in july and august .
" we know that the reason they peak is due to environmental allergens , fungal spore levels . "
climate a factor according to dr nasser , climate change is largely to blame .
" global warming is causing an increase in fungal spore levels as well as pollen , so this is something we are going to see more of .
the season is also starting earlier and finishing later .
" many of these deaths occur in children .
they are mostly completely preventable if they are diagnosed properly . "
chris doyle , a senior nurse who specialises in asthma and allergy at alder hey children 's hospital in liverpool , says there is often a pattern to the allergies affecting the youngsters she sees .
" we have seen a significant rise in the number of allergy referrals .
often these children have multiple allergy problems .
" the initial referral from the gp may go something like this : ' please see this child who has recently had an allergic reaction to a peanut ' .
" then when we do see the child , they are also found to have eczema , asthma and hay fever and often food allergies as well . "
dog allergy kirsty speed , a 27-year-old dancing teacher from cambridge , is a living example of nurse doyle 's list .
having suffered from eczema as a baby , she developed a peanut allergy from the age of two .
allergy house where are the allergens in your house ?
the extent of her problems was not properly diagnosed until she was aged 15 .
" i hated being the odd one out and making my allergies an issue in my life , " she said .
" i often had to sit out of dance classes when i was a child to use the inhaler .
if i was dancing in a dusty room , it would bring on an even worse asthma attack .
" then when i was about four it was realized that i was allergic to my lovely pet dog .
" it was heart wrenching to have to take it back to the animal sanctuary . "
dr nasser says the rise in multiple allergies should be seen within the context of the overall rise in allergies .
the uk has one of the highest diagnosed allergy rates in the world .
" the number of people with more severe allergies is increasing and if you have a severe allergy you are more likely to have multiple allergies " .
he points to the rise in eczema as being significant .
the number of cases in england rose by 40 % in four years according to a study published last month .
one theory for this increase in eczema - which causes severe scaling and breaking of the skin - is that the overuse of soaps and detergents is robbing the skin of its natural nutrients .
gateway allergy eczema is now being seen as a " gateway " which can enable other allergies to develop .
dr nasser explains that the broken skin can allow allergens such as peanuts to enter the unprotected body , prompting the immune system to react as if the peanut was an enemy invader .
" consequently i find it is unusual for anyone to have a nut allergy without having eczema .
it is my belief that nut allergy and most food allergies are often a result of the body becoming sensitised to them through the skin . " he said .
dr nasser says the reasons for the growth in allergies are several and complex .
he cites the hygiene hypothesis as one that is widely supported by the medical profession .
" the uk is a developed society and allergies affect westernised countries .
if a country passes from a rural to an urban society then the existence of allergies escalates .
" the hygiene hypotheses is that in a developed society we avoid exposure to bacterial infection at an early age .
this is unlike rural environments " , he explains .

advertisement " my eyes puffed up , i went head-to-toe bright red , with severe stomach cramps and chest pains " - 27-year-old kirsty speed on her multiple allergies .
by sue emmett bbc news specialist uk clinics have told the bbc they are seeing a significant rise in the number of patients suffering from several allergies at once .
they are also finding symptoms are becoming more severe , causing acute pain and in some cases even death .
many of those afflicted are reported to be children .
staff from specialist clinics in liverpool , cambridge , cardiff , birmingham and london are among those to confirm the rise .
allergy or intolerance ?
an allergy is when the immune system reacts to a harmless substance such as a food or pollen , as if it is n't safe a severe allergy can cause a potentially life threatening shock known as anaphylaxis an intolerance does not affect the immune system an intolerance is generally not life threatening and the symptoms less severe an intolerance is being unable to digest certain foods such as lactose in milk what causes allergies ?
dr jonathan north , a consultant immunologist in birmingham , said : " we used to say that 15 % of the population had an allergy of some sort , now the figure is nearer 40 % .
" as well as the well-documented increase in prevalence , the proportion of complex / multiple allergy cases is increasing . "
the reasons for the rise are not fully understood .
" one of the theories , which i think makes sense as regards food allergy , is that we now have a far wider range of foods available and children are being exposed at a much younger age , " said dr north .
symptoms more severe dr shuaib nasser , a consultant in allergy for the cambridge university nhs trust , has also noted the growth in multiple allergies and is concerned about the increasing severity of allergy symptoms , which can be fatal .
for asthma and hay fever patients , dr nasser says the period of suffering is also getting longer .
" we may think of some allergies as being simply inconvenient but there are patients who die from allergic disorders .
" hay fever is not just a runny nose .
patients develop asthma and are admitted into hospital . "
i find it is unusual for anyone to have a nut allergy without having eczema dr shuaib nasser , allergies expert dr nasser has been running an investigation into asthma deaths .
" we have found that asthma deaths peak in july and august .
" we know that the reason they peak is due to environmental allergens , fungal spore levels . "
climate a factor according to dr nasser , climate change is largely to blame .
" global warming is causing an increase in fungal spore levels as well as pollen , so this is something we are going to see more of .
the season is also starting earlier and finishing later .
" many of these deaths occur in children .
they are mostly completely preventable if they are diagnosed properly . "

advertisement consultant allergist dr shuaib nasser explains how certain allergies tend to be grouped together .
chris doyle , a senior nurse who specialises in asthma and allergy at alder hey children 's hospital in liverpool , says there is often a pattern to the allergies affecting the youngsters she sees .
" we have seen a significant rise in the number of allergy referrals .
often these children have multiple allergy problems .
" the initial referral from the gp may go something like this : ' please see this child who has recently had an allergic reaction to a peanut ' .
" then when we do see the child , they are also found to have eczema , asthma and hay fever and often food allergies as well . "
dog allergy kirsty speed , a 27-year-old dancing teacher from cambridge , is a living example of nurse doyle 's list .
having suffered from eczema as a baby , she developed a peanut allergy from the age of two .
allergy house where are the allergens in your house ?
the extent of her problems was not properly diagnosed until she was aged 15 .
" i hated being the odd one out and making my allergies an issue in my life , " she said .
" i often had to sit out of dance classes when i was a child to use the inhaler .
if i was dancing in a dusty room , it would bring on an even worse asthma attack .
" then when i was about four it was realized that i was allergic to my lovely pet dog .
" it was heart wrenching to have to take it back to the animal sanctuary . "
dr nasser says the rise in multiple allergies should be seen within the context of the overall rise in allergies .
the uk has one of the highest diagnosed allergy rates in the world .
" the number of people with more severe allergies is increasing and if you have a severe allergy you are more likely to have multiple allergies " .
he points to the rise in eczema as being significant .
the number of cases in england rose by 40 % in four years according to a study published last month .
one theory for this increase in eczema - which causes severe scaling and breaking of the skin - is that the overuse of soaps and detergents is robbing the skin of its natural nutrients .
gateway allergy eczema is now being seen as a " gateway " which can enable other allergies to develop .
dr nasser explains that the broken skin can allow allergens such as peanuts to enter the unprotected body , prompting the immune system to react as if the peanut was an enemy invader .
" consequently i find it is unusual for anyone to have a nut allergy without having eczema .
it is my belief that nut allergy and most food allergies are often a result of the body becoming sensitised to them through the skin . " he said .
dr nasser says the reasons for the growth in allergies are several and complex .
he cites the hygiene hypothesis as one that is widely supported by the medical profession .
" the uk is a developed society and allergies affect westernised countries .
if a country passes from a rural to an urban society then the existence of allergies escalates .
" the hygiene hypotheses is that in a developed society we avoid exposure to bacterial infection at an early age .
this is unlike rural environments " , he explains .
as dr nasser said : " some say modern life is making us allergic . "

by sue emmett bbc news specialist uk clinics have told the bbc they are seeing a significant rise in the number of patients suffering from several allergies at once .
they are also finding symptoms are becoming more severe , causing acute pain and in some cases even death .
many of those afflicted are reported to be children .
staff from specialist clinics in liverpool , cambridge , cardiff , birmingham and london are among those to confirm the rise .
allergy or intolerance ?
an allergy is when the immune system reacts to a harmless substance such as a food or pollen , as if it is n't safe a severe allergy can cause a potentially life threatening shock known as anaphylaxis an intolerance does not affect the immune system an intolerance is generally not life threatening and the symptoms less severe an intolerance is being unable to digest certain foods such as lactose in milk what causes allergies ?
dr jonathan north , a consultant immunologist in birmingham , said : " we used to say that 15 % of the population had an allergy of some sort , now the figure is nearer 40 % .
" as well as the well-documented increase in prevalence , the proportion of complex / multiple allergy cases is increasing . "
the reasons for the rise are not fully understood .
" one of the theories , which i think makes sense as regards food allergy , is that we now have a far wider range of foods available and children are being exposed at a much younger age , " said dr north .
symptoms more severe dr shuaib nasser , a consultant in allergy for the cambridge university nhs trust , has also noted the growth in multiple allergies and is concerned about the increasing severity of allergy symptoms , which can be fatal .
for asthma and hay fever patients , dr nasser says the period of suffering is also getting longer .
" we may think of some allergies as being simply inconvenient but there are patients who die from allergic disorders .
" hay fever is not just a runny nose .
patients develop asthma and are admitted into hospital . "
i find it is unusual for anyone to have a nut allergy without having eczema dr shuaib nasser , allergies expert dr nasser has been running an investigation into asthma deaths .
" we have found that asthma deaths peak in july and august .
" we know that the reason they peak is due to environmental allergens , fungal spore levels . "
climate a factor according to dr nasser , climate change is largely to blame .
" global warming is causing an increase in fungal spore levels as well as pollen , so this is something we are going to see more of .
the season is also starting earlier and finishing later .
" many of these deaths occur in children .
they are mostly completely preventable if they are diagnosed properly . "

advertisement consultant allergist dr shuaib nasser explains how certain allergies tend to be grouped together .
chris doyle , a senior nurse who specialises in asthma and allergy at alder hey children 's hospital in liverpool , says there is often a pattern to the allergies affecting the youngsters she sees .
" we have seen a significant rise in the number of allergy referrals .
often these children have multiple allergy problems .
" the initial referral from the gp may go something like this : ' please see this child who has recently had an allergic reaction to a peanut ' .
" then when we do see the child , they are also found to have eczema , asthma and hay fever and often food allergies as well . "
dog allergy kirsty speed , a 27-year-old dancing teacher from cambridge , is a living example of nurse doyle 's list .
having suffered from eczema as a baby , she developed a peanut allergy from the age of two .
allergy house where are the allergens in your house ?
the extent of her problems was not properly diagnosed until she was aged 15 .
" i hated being the odd one out and making my allergies an issue in my life , " she said .
" i often had to sit out of dance classes when i was a child to use the inhaler .
if i was dancing in a dusty room , it would bring on an even worse asthma attack .
" then when i was about four it was realized that i was allergic to my lovely pet dog .
" it was heart wrenching to have to take it back to the animal sanctuary . "
dr nasser says the rise in multiple allergies should be seen within the context of the overall rise in allergies .
the uk has one of the highest diagnosed allergy rates in the world .
" the number of people with more severe allergies is increasing and if you have a severe allergy you are more likely to have multiple allergies " .
he points to the rise in eczema as being significant .
the number of cases in england rose by 40 % in four years according to a study published last month .
one theory for this increase in eczema - which causes severe scaling and breaking of the skin - is that the overuse of soaps and detergents is robbing the skin of its natural nutrients .
gateway allergy eczema is now being seen as a " gateway " which can enable other allergies to develop .
dr nasser explains that the broken skin can allow allergens such as peanuts to enter the unprotected body , prompting the immune system to react as if the peanut was an enemy invader .
" consequently i find it is unusual for anyone to have a nut allergy without having eczema .
it is my belief that nut allergy and most food allergies are often a result of the body becoming sensitised to them through the skin . " he said .
dr nasser says the reasons for the growth in allergies are several and complex .
he cites the hygiene hypothesis as one that is widely supported by the medical profession .
" the uk is a developed society and allergies affect westernised countries .
if a country passes from a rural to an urban society then the existence of allergies escalates .
" the hygiene hypotheses is that in a developed society we avoid exposure to bacterial infection at an early age .
this is unlike rural environments " , he explains .
as dr nasser said : " some say modern life is making us allergic . "
