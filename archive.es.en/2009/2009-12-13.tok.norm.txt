merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .

germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .

" for that the two gentlemen have taken responsibility , " he said . the two men - the head of germany 's armed forces , general wolfgang schneiderhahn and deputy defense minister peter wichert - stepped down last month over the affair which has sparked a heated political controversy in germany . but germany 's der spiegel news magazine and the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung refuted the minister 's account , reporting that the two officials had given guttenberg an account of all available reports about the airstrike when he inquired about it . german officials have said that up to 142 people are believed to have died or been injured in the september 4 airstrike on two tanker trucks in kunduz that had been captured by the taliban .
local afghan leaders have estimated the number of civilian deaths at between 30 and 40 . taliban , not tanks the target ? the latest controversy comes after media reports on the weekend said the target of the airstrike was a group of taliban leaders , not a pair of hijacked tanker trucks as originally reported by the german government . quoting a secret report from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on saturday , the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that colonel georg klein , the german officer who issued the orders for the airstrike , " wanted to attack the people , not the vehicles . "
bildunterschrift : karl-theodor zu guttenberg , left , visited kunduz on friday the new revelations have raised pressure on guttenberg .
the 38-year-old from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian ally of chancellor merkel 's conservative party , initially deemed the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
but he has since reversed that position , calling it " inappropriate . "
opposition calls for full disclosure guttenberg 's turnabout has prompted calls from many german politicians for a full disclosure in the affair .
the new allegations that taliban leaders were directly targeted in the attack have fuelled demands for a full explanation .
" -lrb- the fact that humans were targeted -rrb- is the essence of the report , which nato had and which guttenberg read , " juergen trittin , head of the green party parliamentary faction , said on ard television .
tritten said this amounted to deliberately misleading the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leaders are demanding to know the whole story surrounding the airstrike members of germany 's opposition parties have called for a parliamentary committee hearing to further determine the events preceding the airstrike .
sigmar gabriel , head of the social democratic party , said the existing explanations offered by the government were insufficient .
" every day , new and more dramatic information comes to light through the media , " he said .
gabriel also said that guttenberg should think of resigning over the affair given that his predecessor , franz josef jung was forced to quit after the revelations about airstrike in kunduz triggered a row over a cover-up . mz / sp / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 13.12.2009 europe 's small winemakers unite to save their industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 700 small wine producers met in italy to exchange ideas europe 's small-scale wine producers , usually in competition with one another , have come together to fight what they see as the two biggest threats to their industry : the eu and multinational corporations . in france they 're called vignerons , in italy , vignaioli : small-scale wine producers who do everything from growing and harvesting the grapes to transforming them into wine in their cellars , then bottling and selling it . but , throughout europe , the future of these artisan winemakers is under threat for a variety of reasons . in an attempt to address their problems and come up with some common solutions , the slow food organization invited winemakers from across the continent to participate in a three-day meeting of vignerons d 'europe . over 700 artisan wine producers and enologists from 16 european countries met in the tuscan spa town of montecatini terme last weekend to compare ideas and experiences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global demand for high-quality wines has dropped in recent years " i wanted to meet other vignerons and speak about our problems all together , " said stefania pepe , who makes organic , unfiltered montepulciano d 'abruzzo in central italy .
" the problems i have in my vineyard in abruzzo may be similar to the problems they have in france or portugal or slovenia . " while winemakers have traditionally viewed each other as competition , vignerons d 'europe aims to unite them and create a network . " for me it 's really important to feel i 'm not just an italian winegrower but part of a group of european growers , " said elena pantaleoni , owner of la stoppa vineyard . the situation for european vignerons is critical , not least because over the past year there 's been a huge drop in the price of grapes and demand for good quality wines worldwide . " we 're drinking a lot more large-volume , manufactured wine than we used to , " said international wine journalist paul white .
" the niche markets for these small artisanal producers have dried up , primarily because of the global economic crisis .
everyone 's drinking down . " artisans versus industries vignerons work hard at protecting their vines , hand-selecting their grapes and keeping their wines as unadulterated and additive-free as possible .
they say they can not compete with lower quality , industrially produced wines which are cheaper . they are therefore angry that current eu legislation makes no distinction between the two . the issue of sulfites is a prime example .
all wine that contains them must be clearly marked " contains sulfites " .
since small amounts occur naturally in their grapes , european vignerons are obliged to use the same labels as industrial producers who add large quantities of them . vignerons would therefore like a separate label like winemakers have in the usa : to indicate that their wines contain only naturally occurring sulfites .
they say that regulations like this one , aimed at their industrial counterparts , actually make their lives even more difficult . bildunterschrift : small winemakers say eu rules favor larger producers " the european community is not working for the small , agricultural workers but rather for big , multinational industries , " said chianti producer rolando bettarini , adding that the eu should support them by protecting and promoting their traditional , sustainable winemaking methods . " we should be given extra help and consideration because vignerons do n't only produce wine , we protect nature by taking care of the environment and preserving the landscape . " the vignerons are hoping to make their voice heard through a european manifesto of sustainable winegrowing and winemaking , which they drew up during the meeting . " it 's very important because we are all in the same situation in spain , italy , france , switzerland and germany .
we are up against a very big machine , " said claude serra , who makes wine in the languedoc region of france . " but if we vignerons are all together , we can make the law change , " she added . educating consumers the vignerons hope their manifesto will not only convince lawmakers but also help european wine consumers that the wine produced by a vigneron is a different product than their mass-produced cousins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vignerons say their wines taste better than industrially produced brands " they have to know that this is a safe wine , made by someone who loves the land and takes care of the process from vineyard to bottle , " said stefania pepe .
" they have to recognize the difference between our wines - which have rich , subtle flavors and wo n't give you a headache - and industrially produced wines . " by creating a strong and visible identity through their network , the vignerons d 'europe are hopeful they can create greater public awareness and appreciation for their product . " it 's a question of quality , " says german enologist , uwe hoffman of the international consultancy of organic viticulture .
" the consumer has to see that if he wants to live in a good , healthy environment in the future , he has to pay for it . " author : dany mitzman -lrb- vj -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .

last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .

the banned democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- held a meeting on saturday to determine its next move and members ended up carrying out an initial plan to boycott parliament if their party were banned .
" our -lrb- parliamentary -rrb- group has effectively pulled out from parliament as of today .
it will not participate in any work there , " said ahmet turk , the party 's co-chair .
the dtp has 19 remaining members of parliament left after turk and another deputy were stripped of their seats as a result of the ban .
the political unrest in the country threatens to set back the efforts by turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan to improve relations with the kurdish minority in the country .
the european union and the united states have expressed concern over the dtp 's ban .
the eu warned that it would violate kurdish rights .
the us state department said turkey should advance political freedom for all its citizens and that restricting those rights " should be exercised with extreme caution . "
meanwhile , violent protests continued in turkey on saturday in the country 's mostly kurdish southeast region .
police used tear gas and water cannons against protestors who had lit street barricades on fire and threw stones at security forces .
in banning the dtp on friday , turkey 's constitutional court said the party had been found guilty of cooperating with pkk separatist forces .
the pkk has lead an insurgency in turkey 's southeast for a quarter of a century and is listed as a terrorist group by ankara and much of the international community. mz / reuters / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .
now his successor , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , and merkel herself are feeling the heat. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .
now his successor , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , and merkel herself are feeling the heat. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the banned democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- held a meeting on saturday to determine its next move and members ended up carrying out an initial plan to boycott parliament if their party were banned .
" our -lrb- parliamentary -rrb- group has effectively pulled out from parliament as of today .
it will not participate in any work there , " said ahmet turk , the party 's co-chair .
the dtp has 19 remaining members of parliament left after turk and another deputy were stripped of their seats as a result of the ban .
the political unrest in the country threatens to set back the efforts by turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan to improve relations with the kurdish minority in the country .
the european union and the united states have expressed concern over the dtp 's ban .
the eu warned that it would violate kurdish rights .
the us state department said turkey should advance political freedom for all its citizens and that restricting those rights " should be exercised with extreme caution . "
meanwhile , violent protests continued in turkey on saturday in the country 's mostly kurdish southeast region .
police used tear gas and water cannons against protestors who had lit street barricades on fire and threw stones at security forces .
in banning the dtp on friday , turkey 's constitutional court said the party had been found guilty of cooperating with pkk separatist forces .
the pkk has lead an insurgency in turkey 's southeast for a quarter of a century and is listed as a terrorist group by ankara and much of the international community. mz / reuters / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for that the two gentlemen have taken responsibility , " he said . the two men - the head of germany 's armed forces , general wolfgang schneiderhahn and deputy defense minister peter wichert - stepped down last month over the affair which has sparked a heated political controversy in germany . but germany 's der spiegel news magazine and the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung refuted the minister 's account , reporting that the two officials had given guttenberg an account of all available reports about the airstrike when he inquired about it . german officials have said that up to 142 people are believed to have died or been injured in the september 4 airstrike on two tanker trucks in kunduz that had been captured by the taliban .

the banned democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- held a meeting on saturday to determine its next move and members ended up carrying out an initial plan to boycott parliament if their party were banned .
" our -lrb- parliamentary -rrb- group has effectively pulled out from parliament as of today .
it will not participate in any work there , " said ahmet turk , the party 's co-chair .
the dtp has 19 remaining members of parliament left after turk and another deputy were stripped of their seats as a result of the ban .
the political unrest in the country threatens to set back the efforts by turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan to improve relations with the kurdish minority in the country .
the european union and the united states have expressed concern over the dtp 's ban .
the eu warned that it would violate kurdish rights .
the us state department said turkey should advance political freedom for all its citizens and that restricting those rights " should be exercised with extreme caution . "
meanwhile , violent protests continued in turkey on saturday in the country 's mostly kurdish southeast region .
police used tear gas and water cannons against protestors who had lit street barricades on fire and threw stones at security forces .
in banning the dtp on friday , turkey 's constitutional court said the party had been found guilty of cooperating with pkk separatist forces .
the pkk has lead an insurgency in turkey 's southeast for a quarter of a century and is listed as a terrorist group by ankara and much of the international community. mz / reuters / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the problems i have in my vineyard in abruzzo may be similar to the problems they have in france or portugal or slovenia . " while winemakers have traditionally viewed each other as competition , vignerons d 'europe aims to unite them and create a network . " for me it 's really important to feel i 'm not just an italian winegrower but part of a group of european growers , " said elena pantaleoni , owner of la stoppa vineyard . the situation for european vignerons is critical , not least because over the past year there 's been a huge drop in the price of grapes and demand for good quality wines worldwide . " we 're drinking a lot more large-volume , manufactured wine than we used to , " said international wine journalist paul white .
" the niche markets for these small artisanal producers have dried up , primarily because of the global economic crisis .
everyone 's drinking down . " artisans versus industries vignerons work hard at protecting their vines , hand-selecting their grapes and keeping their wines as unadulterated and additive-free as possible .
they say they can not compete with lower quality , industrially produced wines which are cheaper . they are therefore angry that current eu legislation makes no distinction between the two . the issue of sulfites is a prime example .
all wine that contains them must be clearly marked " contains sulfites " .
since small amounts occur naturally in their grapes , european vignerons are obliged to use the same labels as industrial producers who add large quantities of them . vignerons would therefore like a separate label like winemakers have in the usa : to indicate that their wines contain only naturally occurring sulfites .
they say that regulations like this one , aimed at their industrial counterparts , actually make their lives even more difficult . bildunterschrift : small winemakers say eu rules favor larger producers " the european community is not working for the small , agricultural workers but rather for big , multinational industries , " said chianti producer rolando bettarini , adding that the eu should support them by protecting and promoting their traditional , sustainable winemaking methods . " we should be given extra help and consideration because vignerons do n't only produce wine , we protect nature by taking care of the environment and preserving the landscape . " the vignerons are hoping to make their voice heard through a european manifesto of sustainable winegrowing and winemaking , which they drew up during the meeting . " it 's very important because we are all in the same situation in spain , italy , france , switzerland and germany .
we are up against a very big machine , " said claude serra , who makes wine in the languedoc region of france . " but if we vignerons are all together , we can make the law change , " she added . educating consumers the vignerons hope their manifesto will not only convince lawmakers but also help european wine consumers that the wine produced by a vigneron is a different product than their mass-produced cousins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vignerons say their wines taste better than industrially produced brands " they have to know that this is a safe wine , made by someone who loves the land and takes care of the process from vineyard to bottle , " said stefania pepe .
" they have to recognize the difference between our wines - which have rich , subtle flavors and wo n't give you a headache - and industrially produced wines . " by creating a strong and visible identity through their network , the vignerons d 'europe are hopeful they can create greater public awareness and appreciation for their product . " it 's a question of quality , " says german enologist , uwe hoffman of the international consultancy of organic viticulture .
" the consumer has to see that if he wants to live in a good , healthy environment in the future , he has to pay for it . " author : dany mitzman -lrb- vj -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "

germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .

rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .

the new system would store information on such things as strike participation , absenteeism and more . the planned collection and compilation of information on personal behavior in a nationwide employee data bank has drawn a strong rebuke from germany 's official data protection commissioner , peter schaar .
citing privacy concerns in an interview for the weekend edition of the thueringer allgemeine newspaper , schaar ripped into the plan , which is to take effect in january , calling it " unconstitutional . "
the project , known as " elena , " will store information on personal employee activities , such as the participation in legal industrial action , absenteeism at work , or employer reprimands on as many as 40 million workers registered with the german national pension fund system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's data protection chief peter schaar strongly opposes the plan new data bank is ' excessive ' elena is the german acronym for electronic remuneration verification , but will be storing more than just an individual 's income and tax information .
beginning in 2012 , germany 's social welfare authorities will also be able to use this data to assess whether to pay out or refuse the distribution of benefits .
schaar said the plan " exceeds the limits of legitimacy " and urged lawmakers to revamp the legislation .
petra pau , a member of parliament from the opposition left party , accused the government of suffering from an " excessive collection mania . " gb / dpa / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .

germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .

rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .
now his successor , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , and merkel herself are feeling the heat. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the problems i have in my vineyard in abruzzo may be similar to the problems they have in france or portugal or slovenia . " while winemakers have traditionally viewed each other as competition , vignerons d 'europe aims to unite them and create a network . " for me it 's really important to feel i 'm not just an italian winegrower but part of a group of european growers , " said elena pantaleoni , owner of la stoppa vineyard . the situation for european vignerons is critical , not least because over the past year there 's been a huge drop in the price of grapes and demand for good quality wines worldwide . " we 're drinking a lot more large-volume , manufactured wine than we used to , " said international wine journalist paul white .
" the niche markets for these small artisanal producers have dried up , primarily because of the global economic crisis .
everyone 's drinking down . " artisans versus industries vignerons work hard at protecting their vines , hand-selecting their grapes and keeping their wines as unadulterated and additive-free as possible .
they say they can not compete with lower quality , industrially produced wines which are cheaper . they are therefore angry that current eu legislation makes no distinction between the two . the issue of sulfites is a prime example .
all wine that contains them must be clearly marked " contains sulfites " .
since small amounts occur naturally in their grapes , european vignerons are obliged to use the same labels as industrial producers who add large quantities of them . vignerons would therefore like a separate label like winemakers have in the usa : to indicate that their wines contain only naturally occurring sulfites .
they say that regulations like this one , aimed at their industrial counterparts , actually make their lives even more difficult . bildunterschrift : small winemakers say eu rules favor larger producers " the european community is not working for the small , agricultural workers but rather for big , multinational industries , " said chianti producer rolando bettarini , adding that the eu should support them by protecting and promoting their traditional , sustainable winemaking methods . " we should be given extra help and consideration because vignerons do n't only produce wine , we protect nature by taking care of the environment and preserving the landscape . " the vignerons are hoping to make their voice heard through a european manifesto of sustainable winegrowing and winemaking , which they drew up during the meeting . " it 's very important because we are all in the same situation in spain , italy , france , switzerland and germany .
we are up against a very big machine , " said claude serra , who makes wine in the languedoc region of france . " but if we vignerons are all together , we can make the law change , " she added . educating consumers the vignerons hope their manifesto will not only convince lawmakers but also help european wine consumers that the wine produced by a vigneron is a different product than their mass-produced cousins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vignerons say their wines taste better than industrially produced brands " they have to know that this is a safe wine , made by someone who loves the land and takes care of the process from vineyard to bottle , " said stefania pepe .
" they have to recognize the difference between our wines - which have rich , subtle flavors and wo n't give you a headache - and industrially produced wines . " by creating a strong and visible identity through their network , the vignerons d 'europe are hopeful they can create greater public awareness and appreciation for their product . " it 's a question of quality , " says german enologist , uwe hoffman of the international consultancy of organic viticulture .
" the consumer has to see that if he wants to live in a good , healthy environment in the future , he has to pay for it . " author : dany mitzman -lrb- vj -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for that the two gentlemen have taken responsibility , " he said . the two men - the head of germany 's armed forces , general wolfgang schneiderhahn and deputy defense minister peter wichert - stepped down last month over the affair which has sparked a heated political controversy in germany . but germany 's der spiegel news magazine and the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung refuted the minister 's account , reporting that the two officials had given guttenberg an account of all available reports about the airstrike when he inquired about it . german officials have said that up to 142 people are believed to have died or been injured in the september 4 airstrike on two tanker trucks in kunduz that had been captured by the taliban .
local afghan leaders have estimated the number of civilian deaths at between 30 and 40 . taliban , not tanks the target ? the latest controversy comes after media reports on the weekend said the target of the airstrike was a group of taliban leaders , not a pair of hijacked tanker trucks as originally reported by the german government . quoting a secret report from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on saturday , the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that colonel georg klein , the german officer who issued the orders for the airstrike , " wanted to attack the people , not the vehicles . "
bildunterschrift : karl-theodor zu guttenberg , left , visited kunduz on friday the new revelations have raised pressure on guttenberg .
the 38-year-old from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian ally of chancellor merkel 's conservative party , initially deemed the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
but he has since reversed that position , calling it " inappropriate . "
opposition calls for full disclosure guttenberg 's turnabout has prompted calls from many german politicians for a full disclosure in the affair .
the new allegations that taliban leaders were directly targeted in the attack have fuelled demands for a full explanation .
" -lrb- the fact that humans were targeted -rrb- is the essence of the report , which nato had and which guttenberg read , " juergen trittin , head of the green party parliamentary faction , said on ard television .
tritten said this amounted to deliberately misleading the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leaders are demanding to know the whole story surrounding the airstrike members of germany 's opposition parties have called for a parliamentary committee hearing to further determine the events preceding the airstrike .
sigmar gabriel , head of the social democratic party , said the existing explanations offered by the government were insufficient .
" every day , new and more dramatic information comes to light through the media , " he said .
gabriel also said that guttenberg should think of resigning over the affair given that his predecessor , franz josef jung was forced to quit after the revelations about airstrike in kunduz triggered a row over a cover-up . mz / sp / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .

that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .

the european union and the united states have expressed concern over the dtp 's ban .
the eu warned that it would violate kurdish rights .
the us state department said turkey should advance political freedom for all its citizens and that restricting those rights " should be exercised with extreme caution . "
meanwhile , violent protests continued in turkey on saturday in the country 's mostly kurdish southeast region .
police used tear gas and water cannons against protestors who had lit street barricades on fire and threw stones at security forces .
in banning the dtp on friday , turkey 's constitutional court said the party had been found guilty of cooperating with pkk separatist forces .
the pkk has lead an insurgency in turkey 's southeast for a quarter of a century and is listed as a terrorist group by ankara and much of the international community. mz / reuters / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for that the two gentlemen have taken responsibility , " he said . the two men - the head of germany 's armed forces , general wolfgang schneiderhahn and deputy defense minister peter wichert - stepped down last month over the affair which has sparked a heated political controversy in germany . but germany 's der spiegel news magazine and the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung refuted the minister 's account , reporting that the two officials had given guttenberg an account of all available reports about the airstrike when he inquired about it . german officials have said that up to 142 people are believed to have died or been injured in the september 4 airstrike on two tanker trucks in kunduz that had been captured by the taliban .
local afghan leaders have estimated the number of civilian deaths at between 30 and 40 . taliban , not tanks the target ? the latest controversy comes after media reports on the weekend said the target of the airstrike was a group of taliban leaders , not a pair of hijacked tanker trucks as originally reported by the german government . quoting a secret report from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on saturday , the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that colonel georg klein , the german officer who issued the orders for the airstrike , " wanted to attack the people , not the vehicles . "
bildunterschrift : karl-theodor zu guttenberg , left , visited kunduz on friday the new revelations have raised pressure on guttenberg .
the 38-year-old from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian ally of chancellor merkel 's conservative party , initially deemed the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
but he has since reversed that position , calling it " inappropriate . "
opposition calls for full disclosure guttenberg 's turnabout has prompted calls from many german politicians for a full disclosure in the affair .
the new allegations that taliban leaders were directly targeted in the attack have fuelled demands for a full explanation .
" -lrb- the fact that humans were targeted -rrb- is the essence of the report , which nato had and which guttenberg read , " juergen trittin , head of the green party parliamentary faction , said on ard television .
tritten said this amounted to deliberately misleading the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leaders are demanding to know the whole story surrounding the airstrike members of germany 's opposition parties have called for a parliamentary committee hearing to further determine the events preceding the airstrike .
sigmar gabriel , head of the social democratic party , said the existing explanations offered by the government were insufficient .
" every day , new and more dramatic information comes to light through the media , " he said .
gabriel also said that guttenberg should think of resigning over the affair given that his predecessor , franz josef jung was forced to quit after the revelations about airstrike in kunduz triggered a row over a cover-up . mz / sp / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.12.2009 merkel seeks to win support for tax cuts package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's tax plans aims to boost consumer spending in germany chancellor angela merkel has held crisis talks this sunday with members of her christian democratic union party who are opposed to her plans to slash taxes in order to boost the economy . the crucial talks in berlin were seen as a last-ditch effort to win support for angela merkel 's first major tax cuts package .
merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .
now his successor , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , and merkel herself are feeling the heat. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for that the two gentlemen have taken responsibility , " he said . the two men - the head of germany 's armed forces , general wolfgang schneiderhahn and deputy defense minister peter wichert - stepped down last month over the affair which has sparked a heated political controversy in germany . but germany 's der spiegel news magazine and the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung refuted the minister 's account , reporting that the two officials had given guttenberg an account of all available reports about the airstrike when he inquired about it . german officials have said that up to 142 people are believed to have died or been injured in the september 4 airstrike on two tanker trucks in kunduz that had been captured by the taliban .
local afghan leaders have estimated the number of civilian deaths at between 30 and 40 . taliban , not tanks the target ? the latest controversy comes after media reports on the weekend said the target of the airstrike was a group of taliban leaders , not a pair of hijacked tanker trucks as originally reported by the german government . quoting a secret report from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on saturday , the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that colonel georg klein , the german officer who issued the orders for the airstrike , " wanted to attack the people , not the vehicles . "
bildunterschrift : karl-theodor zu guttenberg , left , visited kunduz on friday the new revelations have raised pressure on guttenberg .
the 38-year-old from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian ally of chancellor merkel 's conservative party , initially deemed the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
but he has since reversed that position , calling it " inappropriate . "

the new system would store information on such things as strike participation , absenteeism and more . the planned collection and compilation of information on personal behavior in a nationwide employee data bank has drawn a strong rebuke from germany 's official data protection commissioner , peter schaar .
citing privacy concerns in an interview for the weekend edition of the thueringer allgemeine newspaper , schaar ripped into the plan , which is to take effect in january , calling it " unconstitutional . "
the project , known as " elena , " will store information on personal employee activities , such as the participation in legal industrial action , absenteeism at work , or employer reprimands on as many as 40 million workers registered with the german national pension fund system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's data protection chief peter schaar strongly opposes the plan new data bank is ' excessive ' elena is the german acronym for electronic remuneration verification , but will be storing more than just an individual 's income and tax information .
beginning in 2012 , germany 's social welfare authorities will also be able to use this data to assess whether to pay out or refuse the distribution of benefits .
schaar said the plan " exceeds the limits of legitimacy " and urged lawmakers to revamp the legislation .

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .

the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .
now his successor , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , and merkel herself are feeling the heat. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.12.2009 berlin club strips classical music of its stuffy rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dj canisius says finding the right mix of classical pieces is key no tuxedos or stifling etiquette - the yellow lounge in berlin has plucked classical music out of its usual stuffy environment and put it in a club .
now , young people are lining up to hear musicians like daniel hope . with low lights , video projections on unfinished walls , and a crowd of 30-somethings in jeans and sweatshirts holding bottles of beer - the yellow lounge looks just like any other trendy berlin club .
but instead of house music , trip-hop or drum-and-bass , it 's a waltz that is coming out of the speakers here .
some of the party-goers are even swaying in three-four time to the music while they chat .
this classical music venue is called the yellow lounge , a club in berlin that is looking to introduce younger people to a genre of music that is usually not even on their radar .
for many of them , classical music is foreign , old-fashioned - and , well , just boring .
it 's associated with well-heeled , middle-aged and elderly people sitting politely in a concert hall .
this lack of interest has economic consequences for the classical market : cd and concert-ticket sales are falling .
it 's the mix that counts once a month , young people can pay six euros -lrb- $ 8.90 -rrb- to listen to mozart arias and bach cantatas in an unusual atmosphere - a concept the yellow lounge has dubbed " classic in the club . "
" we wanted to take classical music off its elite pedestal , " said dj canisius , who helped found the project in 2003 .
" here , everything 's a lot more easy-going than in a traditional concert hall . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usually , classical concerts follow a certain protocol at the club , the 40-year-old dj in a baseball cap decides which symphony recording to play next .
he 's a classically trained violinist and his day job is in an orchestra .
for dj canisius , the yellow lounge is a chance to make classical music attractive to younger audiences - pure , and not backed with house beats or pop rhythms .
" i do n't play the entire pieces , i mix them up , " he explained .
that means a gregorian chant could seamlessly flow into a beethoven symphony , for example .
" it seems out of context at first , but it sounds great . "
the result is a new , unexpected sound that piques listeners ' curiosity .
daniel hope in jeans it 's the live act , however , that is the highlight of each classic in the club event .
many of the performers are young stars in the classical music scene , like british violinist daniel hope , who recently performed for an audience of 500 in the yellow lounge .
dressed in jeans and t-shirts , hope and his five-member ensemble blended right in with the crowd - until they started to play .
hope 's fingers raced across the strings in an energetic interpretation of vivaldi , which won a long round of applause from the club-goers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel hope is a regular at the yellow lounge " i love this directness , " said the 35-year-old violinist of the setting .
he lives in germany and has performed in the yellow lounge several times before .
" it 's really hot in the club , so the sound is dryer .
i have to play more gently . "
most of the audience members are new to classical music , so hope tells a few anecdotes about the composers and the music before he plays each piece : vivaldi was a womanizer and baroque musicians liked to drink and party .
that 's something this audience of nightlife fans can relate to .
in a traditional concert hall , decorum is called for , and listeners often make an extra effort even to hold their sneezing or coughing to the time between pieces .
but in the yellow lounge , drinking or clapping - or sneezing - during the performance is n't frowned upon , and it 's that relaxed atmosphere that keeps people coming back .
most have heard about the club by word of mouth , since the yellow lounge does n't advertise .
that lends the whole thing an insider feel that increases its appeal with this crowd . author : aygul cizmeciogliu -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this classical music venue is called the yellow lounge , a club in berlin that is looking to introduce younger people to a genre of music that is usually not even on their radar .
for many of them , classical music is foreign , old-fashioned - and , well , just boring .
it 's associated with well-heeled , middle-aged and elderly people sitting politely in a concert hall .
this lack of interest has economic consequences for the classical market : cd and concert-ticket sales are falling .

many of the performers are young stars in the classical music scene , like british violinist daniel hope , who recently performed for an audience of 500 in the yellow lounge .

this classical music venue is called the yellow lounge , a club in berlin that is looking to introduce younger people to a genre of music that is usually not even on their radar .
for many of them , classical music is foreign , old-fashioned - and , well , just boring .
it 's associated with well-heeled , middle-aged and elderly people sitting politely in a concert hall .
this lack of interest has economic consequences for the classical market : cd and concert-ticket sales are falling .
it 's the mix that counts once a month , young people can pay six euros -lrb- $ 8.90 -rrb- to listen to mozart arias and bach cantatas in an unusual atmosphere - a concept the yellow lounge has dubbed " classic in the club . "

many of the performers are young stars in the classical music scene , like british violinist daniel hope , who recently performed for an audience of 500 in the yellow lounge .
dressed in jeans and t-shirts , hope and his five-member ensemble blended right in with the crowd - until they started to play .
hope 's fingers raced across the strings in an energetic interpretation of vivaldi , which won a long round of applause from the club-goers .

most of the audience members are new to classical music , so hope tells a few anecdotes about the composers and the music before he plays each piece : vivaldi was a womanizer and baroque musicians liked to drink and party .

the banned democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- held a meeting on saturday to determine its next move and members ended up carrying out an initial plan to boycott parliament if their party were banned .
" our -lrb- parliamentary -rrb- group has effectively pulled out from parliament as of today .
it will not participate in any work there , " said ahmet turk , the party 's co-chair .
the dtp has 19 remaining members of parliament left after turk and another deputy were stripped of their seats as a result of the ban .
the political unrest in the country threatens to set back the efforts by turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan to improve relations with the kurdish minority in the country .
the european union and the united states have expressed concern over the dtp 's ban .
the eu warned that it would violate kurdish rights .
the us state department said turkey should advance political freedom for all its citizens and that restricting those rights " should be exercised with extreme caution . "
meanwhile , violent protests continued in turkey on saturday in the country 's mostly kurdish southeast region .
police used tear gas and water cannons against protestors who had lit street barricades on fire and threw stones at security forces .
in banning the dtp on friday , turkey 's constitutional court said the party had been found guilty of cooperating with pkk separatist forces .
the pkk has lead an insurgency in turkey 's southeast for a quarter of a century and is listed as a terrorist group by ankara and much of the international community. mz / reuters / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.12.2009 merkel seeks to win support for tax cuts package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's tax plans aims to boost consumer spending in germany chancellor angela merkel has held crisis talks this sunday with members of her christian democratic union party who are opposed to her plans to slash taxes in order to boost the economy . the crucial talks in berlin were seen as a last-ditch effort to win support for angela merkel 's first major tax cuts package .
merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .
now his successor , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , and merkel herself are feeling the heat. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for that the two gentlemen have taken responsibility , " he said . the two men - the head of germany 's armed forces , general wolfgang schneiderhahn and deputy defense minister peter wichert - stepped down last month over the affair which has sparked a heated political controversy in germany . but germany 's der spiegel news magazine and the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung refuted the minister 's account , reporting that the two officials had given guttenberg an account of all available reports about the airstrike when he inquired about it . german officials have said that up to 142 people are believed to have died or been injured in the september 4 airstrike on two tanker trucks in kunduz that had been captured by the taliban .
local afghan leaders have estimated the number of civilian deaths at between 30 and 40 . taliban , not tanks the target ? the latest controversy comes after media reports on the weekend said the target of the airstrike was a group of taliban leaders , not a pair of hijacked tanker trucks as originally reported by the german government . quoting a secret report from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on saturday , the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that colonel georg klein , the german officer who issued the orders for the airstrike , " wanted to attack the people , not the vehicles . "
bildunterschrift : karl-theodor zu guttenberg , left , visited kunduz on friday the new revelations have raised pressure on guttenberg .
the 38-year-old from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian ally of chancellor merkel 's conservative party , initially deemed the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
but he has since reversed that position , calling it " inappropriate . "
opposition calls for full disclosure guttenberg 's turnabout has prompted calls from many german politicians for a full disclosure in the affair .
the new allegations that taliban leaders were directly targeted in the attack have fuelled demands for a full explanation .
" -lrb- the fact that humans were targeted -rrb- is the essence of the report , which nato had and which guttenberg read , " juergen trittin , head of the green party parliamentary faction , said on ard television .
tritten said this amounted to deliberately misleading the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leaders are demanding to know the whole story surrounding the airstrike members of germany 's opposition parties have called for a parliamentary committee hearing to further determine the events preceding the airstrike .
sigmar gabriel , head of the social democratic party , said the existing explanations offered by the government were insufficient .
" every day , new and more dramatic information comes to light through the media , " he said .
gabriel also said that guttenberg should think of resigning over the affair given that his predecessor , franz josef jung was forced to quit after the revelations about airstrike in kunduz triggered a row over a cover-up . mz / sp / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .

" for that the two gentlemen have taken responsibility , " he said . the two men - the head of germany 's armed forces , general wolfgang schneiderhahn and deputy defense minister peter wichert - stepped down last month over the affair which has sparked a heated political controversy in germany . but germany 's der spiegel news magazine and the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung refuted the minister 's account , reporting that the two officials had given guttenberg an account of all available reports about the airstrike when he inquired about it . german officials have said that up to 142 people are believed to have died or been injured in the september 4 airstrike on two tanker trucks in kunduz that had been captured by the taliban .
local afghan leaders have estimated the number of civilian deaths at between 30 and 40 . taliban , not tanks the target ? the latest controversy comes after media reports on the weekend said the target of the airstrike was a group of taliban leaders , not a pair of hijacked tanker trucks as originally reported by the german government . quoting a secret report from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on saturday , the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that colonel georg klein , the german officer who issued the orders for the airstrike , " wanted to attack the people , not the vehicles . "
bildunterschrift : karl-theodor zu guttenberg , left , visited kunduz on friday the new revelations have raised pressure on guttenberg .
the 38-year-old from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian ally of chancellor merkel 's conservative party , initially deemed the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
but he has since reversed that position , calling it " inappropriate . "
opposition calls for full disclosure guttenberg 's turnabout has prompted calls from many german politicians for a full disclosure in the affair .
the new allegations that taliban leaders were directly targeted in the attack have fuelled demands for a full explanation .
" -lrb- the fact that humans were targeted -rrb- is the essence of the report , which nato had and which guttenberg read , " juergen trittin , head of the green party parliamentary faction , said on ard television .
tritten said this amounted to deliberately misleading the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leaders are demanding to know the whole story surrounding the airstrike members of germany 's opposition parties have called for a parliamentary committee hearing to further determine the events preceding the airstrike .
sigmar gabriel , head of the social democratic party , said the existing explanations offered by the government were insufficient .
" every day , new and more dramatic information comes to light through the media , " he said .
gabriel also said that guttenberg should think of resigning over the affair given that his predecessor , franz josef jung was forced to quit after the revelations about airstrike in kunduz triggered a row over a cover-up . mz / sp / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the problems i have in my vineyard in abruzzo may be similar to the problems they have in france or portugal or slovenia . " while winemakers have traditionally viewed each other as competition , vignerons d 'europe aims to unite them and create a network . " for me it 's really important to feel i 'm not just an italian winegrower but part of a group of european growers , " said elena pantaleoni , owner of la stoppa vineyard . the situation for european vignerons is critical , not least because over the past year there 's been a huge drop in the price of grapes and demand for good quality wines worldwide . " we 're drinking a lot more large-volume , manufactured wine than we used to , " said international wine journalist paul white .
" the niche markets for these small artisanal producers have dried up , primarily because of the global economic crisis .
everyone 's drinking down . " artisans versus industries vignerons work hard at protecting their vines , hand-selecting their grapes and keeping their wines as unadulterated and additive-free as possible .
they say they can not compete with lower quality , industrially produced wines which are cheaper . they are therefore angry that current eu legislation makes no distinction between the two . the issue of sulfites is a prime example .
all wine that contains them must be clearly marked " contains sulfites " .
since small amounts occur naturally in their grapes , european vignerons are obliged to use the same labels as industrial producers who add large quantities of them . vignerons would therefore like a separate label like winemakers have in the usa : to indicate that their wines contain only naturally occurring sulfites .
they say that regulations like this one , aimed at their industrial counterparts , actually make their lives even more difficult . bildunterschrift : small winemakers say eu rules favor larger producers " the european community is not working for the small , agricultural workers but rather for big , multinational industries , " said chianti producer rolando bettarini , adding that the eu should support them by protecting and promoting their traditional , sustainable winemaking methods . " we should be given extra help and consideration because vignerons do n't only produce wine , we protect nature by taking care of the environment and preserving the landscape . " the vignerons are hoping to make their voice heard through a european manifesto of sustainable winegrowing and winemaking , which they drew up during the meeting . " it 's very important because we are all in the same situation in spain , italy , france , switzerland and germany .
we are up against a very big machine , " said claude serra , who makes wine in the languedoc region of france . " but if we vignerons are all together , we can make the law change , " she added . educating consumers the vignerons hope their manifesto will not only convince lawmakers but also help european wine consumers that the wine produced by a vigneron is a different product than their mass-produced cousins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vignerons say their wines taste better than industrially produced brands " they have to know that this is a safe wine , made by someone who loves the land and takes care of the process from vineyard to bottle , " said stefania pepe .
" they have to recognize the difference between our wines - which have rich , subtle flavors and wo n't give you a headache - and industrially produced wines . " by creating a strong and visible identity through their network , the vignerons d 'europe are hopeful they can create greater public awareness and appreciation for their product . " it 's a question of quality , " says german enologist , uwe hoffman of the international consultancy of organic viticulture .

" the problems i have in my vineyard in abruzzo may be similar to the problems they have in france or portugal or slovenia . " while winemakers have traditionally viewed each other as competition , vignerons d 'europe aims to unite them and create a network . " for me it 's really important to feel i 'm not just an italian winegrower but part of a group of european growers , " said elena pantaleoni , owner of la stoppa vineyard . the situation for european vignerons is critical , not least because over the past year there 's been a huge drop in the price of grapes and demand for good quality wines worldwide . " we 're drinking a lot more large-volume , manufactured wine than we used to , " said international wine journalist paul white .
" the niche markets for these small artisanal producers have dried up , primarily because of the global economic crisis .
everyone 's drinking down . " artisans versus industries vignerons work hard at protecting their vines , hand-selecting their grapes and keeping their wines as unadulterated and additive-free as possible .
they say they can not compete with lower quality , industrially produced wines which are cheaper . they are therefore angry that current eu legislation makes no distinction between the two . the issue of sulfites is a prime example .
all wine that contains them must be clearly marked " contains sulfites " .
since small amounts occur naturally in their grapes , european vignerons are obliged to use the same labels as industrial producers who add large quantities of them . vignerons would therefore like a separate label like winemakers have in the usa : to indicate that their wines contain only naturally occurring sulfites .
they say that regulations like this one , aimed at their industrial counterparts , actually make their lives even more difficult . bildunterschrift : small winemakers say eu rules favor larger producers " the european community is not working for the small , agricultural workers but rather for big , multinational industries , " said chianti producer rolando bettarini , adding that the eu should support them by protecting and promoting their traditional , sustainable winemaking methods . " we should be given extra help and consideration because vignerons do n't only produce wine , we protect nature by taking care of the environment and preserving the landscape . " the vignerons are hoping to make their voice heard through a european manifesto of sustainable winegrowing and winemaking , which they drew up during the meeting . " it 's very important because we are all in the same situation in spain , italy , france , switzerland and germany .
we are up against a very big machine , " said claude serra , who makes wine in the languedoc region of france . " but if we vignerons are all together , we can make the law change , " she added . educating consumers the vignerons hope their manifesto will not only convince lawmakers but also help european wine consumers that the wine produced by a vigneron is a different product than their mass-produced cousins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vignerons say their wines taste better than industrially produced brands " they have to know that this is a safe wine , made by someone who loves the land and takes care of the process from vineyard to bottle , " said stefania pepe .
" they have to recognize the difference between our wines - which have rich , subtle flavors and wo n't give you a headache - and industrially produced wines . " by creating a strong and visible identity through their network , the vignerons d 'europe are hopeful they can create greater public awareness and appreciation for their product . " it 's a question of quality , " says german enologist , uwe hoffman of the international consultancy of organic viticulture .
" the consumer has to see that if he wants to live in a good , healthy environment in the future , he has to pay for it . " author : dany mitzman -lrb- vj -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for that the two gentlemen have taken responsibility , " he said . the two men - the head of germany 's armed forces , general wolfgang schneiderhahn and deputy defense minister peter wichert - stepped down last month over the affair which has sparked a heated political controversy in germany . but germany 's der spiegel news magazine and the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung refuted the minister 's account , reporting that the two officials had given guttenberg an account of all available reports about the airstrike when he inquired about it . german officials have said that up to 142 people are believed to have died or been injured in the september 4 airstrike on two tanker trucks in kunduz that had been captured by the taliban .
local afghan leaders have estimated the number of civilian deaths at between 30 and 40 . taliban , not tanks the target ? the latest controversy comes after media reports on the weekend said the target of the airstrike was a group of taliban leaders , not a pair of hijacked tanker trucks as originally reported by the german government . quoting a secret report from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on saturday , the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that colonel georg klein , the german officer who issued the orders for the airstrike , " wanted to attack the people , not the vehicles . "
bildunterschrift : karl-theodor zu guttenberg , left , visited kunduz on friday the new revelations have raised pressure on guttenberg .
the 38-year-old from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian ally of chancellor merkel 's conservative party , initially deemed the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
but he has since reversed that position , calling it " inappropriate . "
opposition calls for full disclosure guttenberg 's turnabout has prompted calls from many german politicians for a full disclosure in the affair .
the new allegations that taliban leaders were directly targeted in the attack have fuelled demands for a full explanation .
" -lrb- the fact that humans were targeted -rrb- is the essence of the report , which nato had and which guttenberg read , " juergen trittin , head of the green party parliamentary faction , said on ard television .
tritten said this amounted to deliberately misleading the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leaders are demanding to know the whole story surrounding the airstrike members of germany 's opposition parties have called for a parliamentary committee hearing to further determine the events preceding the airstrike .
sigmar gabriel , head of the social democratic party , said the existing explanations offered by the government were insufficient .
" every day , new and more dramatic information comes to light through the media , " he said .
gabriel also said that guttenberg should think of resigning over the affair given that his predecessor , franz josef jung was forced to quit after the revelations about airstrike in kunduz triggered a row over a cover-up . mz / sp / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , young people are lining up to hear musicians like daniel hope . with low lights , video projections on unfinished walls , and a crowd of 30-somethings in jeans and sweatshirts holding bottles of beer - the yellow lounge looks just like any other trendy berlin club .

this classical music venue is called the yellow lounge , a club in berlin that is looking to introduce younger people to a genre of music that is usually not even on their radar .
for many of them , classical music is foreign , old-fashioned - and , well , just boring .
it 's associated with well-heeled , middle-aged and elderly people sitting politely in a concert hall .
this lack of interest has economic consequences for the classical market : cd and concert-ticket sales are falling .
it 's the mix that counts once a month , young people can pay six euros -lrb- $ 8.90 -rrb- to listen to mozart arias and bach cantatas in an unusual atmosphere - a concept the yellow lounge has dubbed " classic in the club . "

for dj canisius , the yellow lounge is a chance to make classical music attractive to younger audiences - pure , and not backed with house beats or pop rhythms .
" i do n't play the entire pieces , i mix them up , " he explained .

many of the performers are young stars in the classical music scene , like british violinist daniel hope , who recently performed for an audience of 500 in the yellow lounge .
dressed in jeans and t-shirts , hope and his five-member ensemble blended right in with the crowd - until they started to play .
hope 's fingers raced across the strings in an energetic interpretation of vivaldi , which won a long round of applause from the club-goers .

most of the audience members are new to classical music , so hope tells a few anecdotes about the composers and the music before he plays each piece : vivaldi was a womanizer and baroque musicians liked to drink and party .
that 's something this audience of nightlife fans can relate to .
in a traditional concert hall , decorum is called for , and listeners often make an extra effort even to hold their sneezing or coughing to the time between pieces .

" i do n't play the entire pieces , i mix them up , " he explained .
that means a gregorian chant could seamlessly flow into a beethoven symphony , for example .
" it seems out of context at first , but it sounds great . "
the result is a new , unexpected sound that piques listeners ' curiosity .
daniel hope in jeans it 's the live act , however , that is the highlight of each classic in the club event .
many of the performers are young stars in the classical music scene , like british violinist daniel hope , who recently performed for an audience of 500 in the yellow lounge .
dressed in jeans and t-shirts , hope and his five-member ensemble blended right in with the crowd - until they started to play .
hope 's fingers raced across the strings in an energetic interpretation of vivaldi , which won a long round of applause from the club-goers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel hope is a regular at the yellow lounge " i love this directness , " said the 35-year-old violinist of the setting .
he lives in germany and has performed in the yellow lounge several times before .
" it 's really hot in the club , so the sound is dryer .
i have to play more gently . "
most of the audience members are new to classical music , so hope tells a few anecdotes about the composers and the music before he plays each piece : vivaldi was a womanizer and baroque musicians liked to drink and party .
that 's something this audience of nightlife fans can relate to .
in a traditional concert hall , decorum is called for , and listeners often make an extra effort even to hold their sneezing or coughing to the time between pieces .
but in the yellow lounge , drinking or clapping - or sneezing - during the performance is n't frowned upon , and it 's that relaxed atmosphere that keeps people coming back .
most have heard about the club by word of mouth , since the yellow lounge does n't advertise .
that lends the whole thing an insider feel that increases its appeal with this crowd . author : aygul cizmeciogliu -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.12.2009 merkel seeks to win support for tax cuts package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's tax plans aims to boost consumer spending in germany chancellor angela merkel has held crisis talks this sunday with members of her christian democratic union party who are opposed to her plans to slash taxes in order to boost the economy . the crucial talks in berlin were seen as a last-ditch effort to win support for angela merkel 's first major tax cuts package .
merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .
now his successor , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , and merkel herself are feeling the heat. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the banned democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- held a meeting on saturday to determine its next move and members ended up carrying out an initial plan to boycott parliament if their party were banned .
" our -lrb- parliamentary -rrb- group has effectively pulled out from parliament as of today .
it will not participate in any work there , " said ahmet turk , the party 's co-chair .
the dtp has 19 remaining members of parliament left after turk and another deputy were stripped of their seats as a result of the ban .
the political unrest in the country threatens to set back the efforts by turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan to improve relations with the kurdish minority in the country .
the european union and the united states have expressed concern over the dtp 's ban .
the eu warned that it would violate kurdish rights .
the us state department said turkey should advance political freedom for all its citizens and that restricting those rights " should be exercised with extreme caution . "
meanwhile , violent protests continued in turkey on saturday in the country 's mostly kurdish southeast region .
police used tear gas and water cannons against protestors who had lit street barricades on fire and threw stones at security forces .
in banning the dtp on friday , turkey 's constitutional court said the party had been found guilty of cooperating with pkk separatist forces .
the pkk has lead an insurgency in turkey 's southeast for a quarter of a century and is listed as a terrorist group by ankara and much of the international community. mz / reuters / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the problems i have in my vineyard in abruzzo may be similar to the problems they have in france or portugal or slovenia . " while winemakers have traditionally viewed each other as competition , vignerons d 'europe aims to unite them and create a network . " for me it 's really important to feel i 'm not just an italian winegrower but part of a group of european growers , " said elena pantaleoni , owner of la stoppa vineyard . the situation for european vignerons is critical , not least because over the past year there 's been a huge drop in the price of grapes and demand for good quality wines worldwide . " we 're drinking a lot more large-volume , manufactured wine than we used to , " said international wine journalist paul white .
" the niche markets for these small artisanal producers have dried up , primarily because of the global economic crisis .
everyone 's drinking down . " artisans versus industries vignerons work hard at protecting their vines , hand-selecting their grapes and keeping their wines as unadulterated and additive-free as possible .
they say they can not compete with lower quality , industrially produced wines which are cheaper . they are therefore angry that current eu legislation makes no distinction between the two . the issue of sulfites is a prime example .
all wine that contains them must be clearly marked " contains sulfites " .
since small amounts occur naturally in their grapes , european vignerons are obliged to use the same labels as industrial producers who add large quantities of them . vignerons would therefore like a separate label like winemakers have in the usa : to indicate that their wines contain only naturally occurring sulfites .
they say that regulations like this one , aimed at their industrial counterparts , actually make their lives even more difficult . bildunterschrift : small winemakers say eu rules favor larger producers " the european community is not working for the small , agricultural workers but rather for big , multinational industries , " said chianti producer rolando bettarini , adding that the eu should support them by protecting and promoting their traditional , sustainable winemaking methods . " we should be given extra help and consideration because vignerons do n't only produce wine , we protect nature by taking care of the environment and preserving the landscape . " the vignerons are hoping to make their voice heard through a european manifesto of sustainable winegrowing and winemaking , which they drew up during the meeting . " it 's very important because we are all in the same situation in spain , italy , france , switzerland and germany .
we are up against a very big machine , " said claude serra , who makes wine in the languedoc region of france . " but if we vignerons are all together , we can make the law change , " she added . educating consumers the vignerons hope their manifesto will not only convince lawmakers but also help european wine consumers that the wine produced by a vigneron is a different product than their mass-produced cousins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vignerons say their wines taste better than industrially produced brands " they have to know that this is a safe wine , made by someone who loves the land and takes care of the process from vineyard to bottle , " said stefania pepe .
" they have to recognize the difference between our wines - which have rich , subtle flavors and wo n't give you a headache - and industrially produced wines . " by creating a strong and visible identity through their network , the vignerons d 'europe are hopeful they can create greater public awareness and appreciation for their product . " it 's a question of quality , " says german enologist , uwe hoffman of the international consultancy of organic viticulture .

" for that the two gentlemen have taken responsibility , " he said . the two men - the head of germany 's armed forces , general wolfgang schneiderhahn and deputy defense minister peter wichert - stepped down last month over the affair which has sparked a heated political controversy in germany . but germany 's der spiegel news magazine and the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung refuted the minister 's account , reporting that the two officials had given guttenberg an account of all available reports about the airstrike when he inquired about it . german officials have said that up to 142 people are believed to have died or been injured in the september 4 airstrike on two tanker trucks in kunduz that had been captured by the taliban .
local afghan leaders have estimated the number of civilian deaths at between 30 and 40 . taliban , not tanks the target ? the latest controversy comes after media reports on the weekend said the target of the airstrike was a group of taliban leaders , not a pair of hijacked tanker trucks as originally reported by the german government . quoting a secret report from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on saturday , the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that colonel georg klein , the german officer who issued the orders for the airstrike , " wanted to attack the people , not the vehicles . "
bildunterschrift : karl-theodor zu guttenberg , left , visited kunduz on friday the new revelations have raised pressure on guttenberg .
the 38-year-old from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian ally of chancellor merkel 's conservative party , initially deemed the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
but he has since reversed that position , calling it " inappropriate . "
opposition calls for full disclosure guttenberg 's turnabout has prompted calls from many german politicians for a full disclosure in the affair .
the new allegations that taliban leaders were directly targeted in the attack have fuelled demands for a full explanation .
" -lrb- the fact that humans were targeted -rrb- is the essence of the report , which nato had and which guttenberg read , " juergen trittin , head of the green party parliamentary faction , said on ard television .
tritten said this amounted to deliberately misleading the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leaders are demanding to know the whole story surrounding the airstrike members of germany 's opposition parties have called for a parliamentary committee hearing to further determine the events preceding the airstrike .
sigmar gabriel , head of the social democratic party , said the existing explanations offered by the government were insufficient .
" every day , new and more dramatic information comes to light through the media , " he said .
gabriel also said that guttenberg should think of resigning over the affair given that his predecessor , franz josef jung was forced to quit after the revelations about airstrike in kunduz triggered a row over a cover-up . mz / sp / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .
now his successor , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , and merkel herself are feeling the heat. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .

the new system would store information on such things as strike participation , absenteeism and more . the planned collection and compilation of information on personal behavior in a nationwide employee data bank has drawn a strong rebuke from germany 's official data protection commissioner , peter schaar .
citing privacy concerns in an interview for the weekend edition of the thueringer allgemeine newspaper , schaar ripped into the plan , which is to take effect in january , calling it " unconstitutional . "
the project , known as " elena , " will store information on personal employee activities , such as the participation in legal industrial action , absenteeism at work , or employer reprimands on as many as 40 million workers registered with the german national pension fund system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's data protection chief peter schaar strongly opposes the plan new data bank is ' excessive ' elena is the german acronym for electronic remuneration verification , but will be storing more than just an individual 's income and tax information .

schaar said the plan " exceeds the limits of legitimacy " and urged lawmakers to revamp the legislation .

" the problems i have in my vineyard in abruzzo may be similar to the problems they have in france or portugal or slovenia . " while winemakers have traditionally viewed each other as competition , vignerons d 'europe aims to unite them and create a network . " for me it 's really important to feel i 'm not just an italian winegrower but part of a group of european growers , " said elena pantaleoni , owner of la stoppa vineyard . the situation for european vignerons is critical , not least because over the past year there 's been a huge drop in the price of grapes and demand for good quality wines worldwide . " we 're drinking a lot more large-volume , manufactured wine than we used to , " said international wine journalist paul white .
" the niche markets for these small artisanal producers have dried up , primarily because of the global economic crisis .
everyone 's drinking down . " artisans versus industries vignerons work hard at protecting their vines , hand-selecting their grapes and keeping their wines as unadulterated and additive-free as possible .
they say they can not compete with lower quality , industrially produced wines which are cheaper . they are therefore angry that current eu legislation makes no distinction between the two . the issue of sulfites is a prime example .
all wine that contains them must be clearly marked " contains sulfites " .
since small amounts occur naturally in their grapes , european vignerons are obliged to use the same labels as industrial producers who add large quantities of them . vignerons would therefore like a separate label like winemakers have in the usa : to indicate that their wines contain only naturally occurring sulfites .
they say that regulations like this one , aimed at their industrial counterparts , actually make their lives even more difficult . bildunterschrift : small winemakers say eu rules favor larger producers " the european community is not working for the small , agricultural workers but rather for big , multinational industries , " said chianti producer rolando bettarini , adding that the eu should support them by protecting and promoting their traditional , sustainable winemaking methods . " we should be given extra help and consideration because vignerons do n't only produce wine , we protect nature by taking care of the environment and preserving the landscape . " the vignerons are hoping to make their voice heard through a european manifesto of sustainable winegrowing and winemaking , which they drew up during the meeting . " it 's very important because we are all in the same situation in spain , italy , france , switzerland and germany .
we are up against a very big machine , " said claude serra , who makes wine in the languedoc region of france . " but if we vignerons are all together , we can make the law change , " she added . educating consumers the vignerons hope their manifesto will not only convince lawmakers but also help european wine consumers that the wine produced by a vigneron is a different product than their mass-produced cousins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vignerons say their wines taste better than industrially produced brands " they have to know that this is a safe wine , made by someone who loves the land and takes care of the process from vineyard to bottle , " said stefania pepe .
" they have to recognize the difference between our wines - which have rich , subtle flavors and wo n't give you a headache - and industrially produced wines . " by creating a strong and visible identity through their network , the vignerons d 'europe are hopeful they can create greater public awareness and appreciation for their product .

the european union and the united states have expressed concern over the dtp 's ban .
the eu warned that it would violate kurdish rights .
the us state department said turkey should advance political freedom for all its citizens and that restricting those rights " should be exercised with extreme caution . "
meanwhile , violent protests continued in turkey on saturday in the country 's mostly kurdish southeast region .
police used tear gas and water cannons against protestors who had lit street barricades on fire and threw stones at security forces .
in banning the dtp on friday , turkey 's constitutional court said the party had been found guilty of cooperating with pkk separatist forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.12.2009 merkel seeks to win support for tax cuts package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's tax plans aims to boost consumer spending in germany chancellor angela merkel has held crisis talks this sunday with members of her christian democratic union party who are opposed to her plans to slash taxes in order to boost the economy . the crucial talks in berlin were seen as a last-ditch effort to win support for angela merkel 's first major tax cuts package .
merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .
now his successor , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , and merkel herself are feeling the heat. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.12.2009 merkel seeks to win support for tax cuts package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's tax plans aims to boost consumer spending in germany chancellor angela merkel has held crisis talks this sunday with members of her christian democratic union party who are opposed to her plans to slash taxes in order to boost the economy . the crucial talks in berlin were seen as a last-ditch effort to win support for angela merkel 's first major tax cuts package .
merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .
now his successor , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , and merkel herself are feeling the heat. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new system would store information on such things as strike participation , absenteeism and more . the planned collection and compilation of information on personal behavior in a nationwide employee data bank has drawn a strong rebuke from germany 's official data protection commissioner , peter schaar .
citing privacy concerns in an interview for the weekend edition of the thueringer allgemeine newspaper , schaar ripped into the plan , which is to take effect in january , calling it " unconstitutional . "
the project , known as " elena , " will store information on personal employee activities , such as the participation in legal industrial action , absenteeism at work , or employer reprimands on as many as 40 million workers registered with the german national pension fund system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's data protection chief peter schaar strongly opposes the plan new data bank is ' excessive ' elena is the german acronym for electronic remuneration verification , but will be storing more than just an individual 's income and tax information .

schaar said the plan " exceeds the limits of legitimacy " and urged lawmakers to revamp the legislation .

police used tear gas and water cannons against protestors who had lit street barricades on fire and threw stones at security forces .
in banning the dtp on friday , turkey 's constitutional court said the party had been found guilty of cooperating with pkk separatist forces .

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .

merkel 's second term as chancellor since her re-election at the end of september has not been as agreeable as she may have hoped .
the short period since the new coalition government – led by her conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- as junior partners – took office in late october has been marked by squabbles over how best to boost the economy . a controversial airstrike in afghanistan has also forced the resignation of a minister .
at the heart of the coalition 's roadmap to recovery after germany 's worst recession since world war ii , is a program of tax cuts aimed at putting more money in consumers ' pockets and cutting recession-hit firms some slack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the tax reform bid fails it would be viewed as a false start for the new coalition the bundesrat , parliament 's upper house , was due to vote on the first wave of tax cuts on december 18 . but several premiers of germany 's 16 debt-ridden states fear the new package would lead to lower state revenues .
a false start ?
some analysts say a failure to pass the new government 's first piece of legislation would be a demoralizing development .
the die zeit weekly said it " would complete the impression of a false start . "
in a last-ditch effort to ensure that the proposal becomes law , merkel on sunday met with the main opponent , fellow christian democrat and premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , peter harry carstensen .
carstensen wants his cash-strapped state to be compensated but the german chancellor has ruled out " buying out " any opposition .
other states have threatened to block the bill if schleswig-holstein gets special treatment .
carstensen said his talks with the chancellor had been productive but no decision had been taken . " we got the impression that the government takes our worries seriously and understood them , " carstensen said after meeting merkel in berlin .
" the government wo n't leave us alone . "
carstensen has demanded compensation for losses that will result from federal measures to cut 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in taxes in 2010 .
he has said his state can not afford the losses caused by the tax cuts .
guido westerwelle , foreign minister and head of the business-friendly free democrats , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he expected to " win over the states with good arguments . "
" if you want growth , if you want jobs , then you have to pass this law , " he said in berlin on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says the reforms will put more money in consumers ' pockets more cuts could follow the proposed cuts , worth some 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.5 billion dollars -rrb- , would just be the tip of the iceberg , with merkel and her fdp partners aiming for almost three times that amount , despite germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
germany plans to double net new borrowing next year and increase public spending to support a fragile economic recovery which it expects will gather some pace in 2011 .
the government expects the economy , europe 's largest , to grow by 1.5-2.0 percent in 2011 , up from a forecast 1.2 percent next year , a government source told reuters .
" those who have experienced how hard merkel is fighting now ... have only to imagine how it is going to be in a year 's time when we 're talking about far greater sums , " the sueddeutsche zeitung daily said in an editorial .
analysts expect further trouble over reforms to how germany taxes its citizens and firms that the fdp is demanding as well as over how to patch up the ailing healthcare system .
rift over afghan mission it 's not just the discord over the tax cuts issue that is troubling merkel – the unpopular move to increase troop numbers in afghanistan is also proving a divisive issue .
last week , horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu , annoyed the chancellor by talking down the chances of sending more bundeswehr troops to afghanistan .
berlin has put off a decision on the issue until after an international conference on afghanistan scheduled to be held in london on january 28 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has around 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan the afghan mission , already unpopular among voters , has become even more contentious in recent weeks owing to an airstrike ordered by a german commander in september , which is believed to have killed around 140 people , including dozens of afghan civilians .
that controversy has already claimed the heads of a minister and two senior military officials . just over two weeks ago , franz josef jung , who was defense minister at the time of the airstrike , quit his new job as labor minister over his handling of the affair .

the project , known as " elena , " will store information on personal employee activities , such as the participation in legal industrial action , absenteeism at work , or employer reprimands on as many as 40 million workers registered with the german national pension fund system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's data protection chief peter schaar strongly opposes the plan new data bank is ' excessive ' elena is the german acronym for electronic remuneration verification , but will be storing more than just an individual 's income and tax information .
beginning in 2012 , germany 's social welfare authorities will also be able to use this data to assess whether to pay out or refuse the distribution of benefits .
schaar said the plan " exceeds the limits of legitimacy " and urged lawmakers to revamp the legislation .
petra pau , a member of parliament from the opposition left party , accused the government of suffering from an " excessive collection mania . " gb / dpa / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for that the two gentlemen have taken responsibility , " he said . the two men - the head of germany 's armed forces , general wolfgang schneiderhahn and deputy defense minister peter wichert - stepped down last month over the affair which has sparked a heated political controversy in germany . but germany 's der spiegel news magazine and the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung refuted the minister 's account , reporting that the two officials had given guttenberg an account of all available reports about the airstrike when he inquired about it . german officials have said that up to 142 people are believed to have died or been injured in the september 4 airstrike on two tanker trucks in kunduz that had been captured by the taliban .
local afghan leaders have estimated the number of civilian deaths at between 30 and 40 . taliban , not tanks the target ? the latest controversy comes after media reports on the weekend said the target of the airstrike was a group of taliban leaders , not a pair of hijacked tanker trucks as originally reported by the german government . quoting a secret report from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- on saturday , the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that colonel georg klein , the german officer who issued the orders for the airstrike , " wanted to attack the people , not the vehicles . "
bildunterschrift : karl-theodor zu guttenberg , left , visited kunduz on friday the new revelations have raised pressure on guttenberg .
the 38-year-old from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian ally of chancellor merkel 's conservative party , initially deemed the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
but he has since reversed that position , calling it " inappropriate . "
opposition calls for full disclosure guttenberg 's turnabout has prompted calls from many german politicians for a full disclosure in the affair .
the new allegations that taliban leaders were directly targeted in the attack have fuelled demands for a full explanation .
" -lrb- the fact that humans were targeted -rrb- is the essence of the report , which nato had and which guttenberg read , " juergen trittin , head of the green party parliamentary faction , said on ard television .
tritten said this amounted to deliberately misleading the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leaders are demanding to know the whole story surrounding the airstrike members of germany 's opposition parties have called for a parliamentary committee hearing to further determine the events preceding the airstrike .
sigmar gabriel , head of the social democratic party , said the existing explanations offered by the government were insufficient .
" every day , new and more dramatic information comes to light through the media , " he said .
gabriel also said that guttenberg should think of resigning over the affair given that his predecessor , franz josef jung was forced to quit after the revelations about airstrike in kunduz triggered a row over a cover-up . mz / sp / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
