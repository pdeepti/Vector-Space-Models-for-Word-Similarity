" i have today , with some european colleagues , already told iran to immediately make clear whether the election results announced can be taken seriously or not , " he said . steinmeier also said that he had summoned iran 's ambassador to the foreign ministry to discuss the " brutal actions " iran 's security forces have used against protesters . " we are looking towards tehran with great concern at the moment .
there are a lot of reports of electoral fraud . " said steinmeier in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster , ard . eu officials also expresssed their reservations about the results of the polling in tehran . " the presidency is concerned about alleged irregularities during the election and post-election violence that broke out immediately after the release of the official election results on 13 june 2009 , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " the presidency expects the new government of the islamic republic of iran will take its responsibility towards the international community and respect its international obligations , " it said , adding that the eu still hoped to resume dialogue with tehran over its disputed nuclear program . correspondents hampered in reporting efforts on sunday , the news division heads of german television networks zdf and ard filed a protest with the iranian ambassador about restrictions placed on their reporters . according to a joint letter sent by thomas baumann of ard and nikolaus brender of zdf , their correspondents were deliberately hampered in their ability to report the events from tehran . they specifically mentioned ard correspondent peter metzger , who was prevented from leaving his hotel room in tehran , and zdf reporter halim hosny along with his staff who had been forbidden to report details of the election . disputed results official results show that president ahmadinejad was re-elected with more than 62 percent of the vote .
defeated candidate mir hossein mousavi formally appealed against the result on sunday to the legislative body , the guardian council , a statement on his website said .
" today , i have submitted my official formal request to the council to cancel the election result , " mousavi said in the statement .
" i urge you iranian nation to continue your nationwide protests in a peaceful and legal way . "
mousavi urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against the " rigged " election , alleging widespread irregularities in the polls .
critics of the poll say many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi appealed to his supporters to reject violence mousavi also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign used to reach young , urban voters .
ahmadinejad defended his victory at a mass rally in tehran on sunday , saying the election was fair .
" some inside or outside iran have come out and said the elections have been distorted .
where is the distortion in the election ? "
" their -lrb- western -rrb- standpoint is if the candidate they propagated does not win , then there has definitely been cheating , " he said .
post-election violence protests against ahmadinejad 's landslide election victory turned violent on saturday as supporters of reformist presidential candidate , mir hossein mousavi , clashed with police in the iranian capital in the worst scenes of violence since the 1979 islamic revolution .
riot police patrolled the streets of tehran as thousands of opposition supporters took part in demonstrations in iran 's capital , defying police warnings .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 62.6 percent of votes against 33.7 percent for mousavi in a record 85 percent turnout .

" i have today , with some european colleagues , already told iran to immediately make clear whether the election results announced can be taken seriously or not , " he said . steinmeier also said that he had summoned iran 's ambassador to the foreign ministry to discuss the " brutal actions " iran 's security forces have used against protesters . " we are looking towards tehran with great concern at the moment .
there are a lot of reports of electoral fraud . " said steinmeier in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster , ard . eu officials also expresssed their reservations about the results of the polling in tehran . " the presidency is concerned about alleged irregularities during the election and post-election violence that broke out immediately after the release of the official election results on 13 june 2009 , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " the presidency expects the new government of the islamic republic of iran will take its responsibility towards the international community and respect its international obligations , " it said , adding that the eu still hoped to resume dialogue with tehran over its disputed nuclear program . correspondents hampered in reporting efforts on sunday , the news division heads of german television networks zdf and ard filed a protest with the iranian ambassador about restrictions placed on their reporters . according to a joint letter sent by thomas baumann of ard and nikolaus brender of zdf , their correspondents were deliberately hampered in their ability to report the events from tehran . they specifically mentioned ard correspondent peter metzger , who was prevented from leaving his hotel room in tehran , and zdf reporter halim hosny along with his staff who had been forbidden to report details of the election . disputed results official results show that president ahmadinejad was re-elected with more than 62 percent of the vote .
defeated candidate mir hossein mousavi formally appealed against the result on sunday to the legislative body , the guardian council , a statement on his website said .
" today , i have submitted my official formal request to the council to cancel the election result , " mousavi said in the statement .
" i urge you iranian nation to continue your nationwide protests in a peaceful and legal way . "
mousavi urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against the " rigged " election , alleging widespread irregularities in the polls .
critics of the poll say many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi appealed to his supporters to reject violence mousavi also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign used to reach young , urban voters .
ahmadinejad defended his victory at a mass rally in tehran on sunday , saying the election was fair .
" some inside or outside iran have come out and said the elections have been distorted .
where is the distortion in the election ? "
" their -lrb- western -rrb- standpoint is if the candidate they propagated does not win , then there has definitely been cheating , " he said .
post-election violence protests against ahmadinejad 's landslide election victory turned violent on saturday as supporters of reformist presidential candidate , mir hossein mousavi , clashed with police in the iranian capital in the worst scenes of violence since the 1979 islamic revolution .
riot police patrolled the streets of tehran as thousands of opposition supporters took part in demonstrations in iran 's capital , defying police warnings .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 62.6 percent of votes against 33.7 percent for mousavi in a record 85 percent turnout .

they are often the first ones to lose their jobs , face pay cuts and harder working conditions .
still , even the current crisis wo n't stop the trend toward migration . as the economic malaise deepens and shows no clear signs of abating anytime soon , many countries around the world are turning up the pressure on migrants in an effort to ease the strain on the local labor market .
japan , a nation with few migrant laborers to begin with , introduced a program that offers latin american guest workers of japanese ancestry cash incentives if they leave the country .
in europe , spain and the czech republic are also trying to persuade workers from outside the european union to go back home by paying them money to do so .
while japan 's program bars workers who participate from returning to the country , spain 's program allows migrants to come back after three years under the condition that they have a specific work contract . it 's a natural impulse that countries are looking at curbing the number of migrant workers in times of economic turmoil , says dietrich thraenhardt , a leading migration expert who is currently a fellow at the transatlantic academy in washington .
he clearly favors the spanish incentive model for migrants .
" i think it makes sense as long as migrants are free to chose .
some migrants may want to return home and if you take for instance the funding from spain back to romania you can live better there .
but other migrants will want to stay and as long as they can chose i think it 's a good policy , " he says .
but as jemini pandya , spokeswoman for the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in geneva points out , the response to the spanish initiative has n't been dramatic .
most migrants think twice before they leave the country to which they came - often enduring considerable hardships on the way .
they know that once they go back to their home country , it will be hard to return again .
difficult data to ascertain in concrete terms how migrants are affected by the economic crisis is not easy .
many countries simply do n't have the tools to accurately document the flows of migrant workers and their financial situation in real-time , says pandya .
often it can take years until reliable data is gathered .
one of the best documented , current and most vivid examples showing how migrants are affected directly by the economic meltdown comes out of mexico .
according to the country 's central bank , the amount of money sent home by mexicans working abroad dropped by 19 percent in april of this year compared to the same month the previous year .
it was the steepest decline of so called remittances on record .
for mexico , which ranks third among countries receiving the highest remittances , the loss in revenue from abroad is significant .
the money sent home from mexicans working predominently in the united states amounted to roughly 25 billion dollars last year .
it is the country 's second largest source of income after oil exports . some experts deduct a historic reversal of the global migration trend from those numbers as well as from figures suggesting a drop in migration to the us and other countries and an increase in migrants leaving the us and other migration destinations .
however , the iom is more cautious .
spokeswoman jemini pandya argues that just because remittances are falling , it does n't necessarily mean that migrants have left the country , instead many may be simply sending less money home and trying to weather the crisis .
what 's more , says pandya , many people who are going back are planning to do so only for up to six months .
trend continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish migrant workers left britain to head home according to the iom there is no reversal of the global migration pattern .
instead , argues pandya , each country and region must be analysed individually .
in many cases , the economic crisis is n't the sole reason why migrants go back home .
" for example polish migrant workers to the uk and ireland have been returning to poland in large numbers , even actually before the financial crisis started , because the british economy had been deteriorating and the polish economy was stronger at the time and so they had already started to go back , " she says .
the same is true for brasilians leaving europe and for workers in the gulf states returning to india , pakistan and bangladesh , adds pandya .
even with the economic crisis , the iom does n't expect the total number of global migrants to drop and estimates that there will be between 210 and 214 million migrants by the end of next year .
dietrich thraenhardt also does n't predict a reversal of the long term trend toward migration , but notes that people might be inclined to be less mobile during the economic crisis .
" when the economy gets better again the migration will resume , because the structural imbalances between the poor southern world and the rich northern world with its problematic demography are still there and so the rich world needs labor from the poor world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trend toward international migration continues despite the crisis and when that happens , countries like britain , australia or malaysia , which have now scaled back the number of skilled and unskilled workers they let in , will have to ease their restrictions again .
because ultimately the fundamental labor shortages in these and many other countries can not be filled by domestic workers - even during an economic crisis , says jemini pandya : " migration never stops . "

they are often the first ones to lose their jobs , face pay cuts and harder working conditions .
still , even the current crisis wo n't stop the trend toward migration . as the economic malaise deepens and shows no clear signs of abating anytime soon , many countries around the world are turning up the pressure on migrants in an effort to ease the strain on the local labor market .
japan , a nation with few migrant laborers to begin with , introduced a program that offers latin american guest workers of japanese ancestry cash incentives if they leave the country .
in europe , spain and the czech republic are also trying to persuade workers from outside the european union to go back home by paying them money to do so .
while japan 's program bars workers who participate from returning to the country , spain 's program allows migrants to come back after three years under the condition that they have a specific work contract . it 's a natural impulse that countries are looking at curbing the number of migrant workers in times of economic turmoil , says dietrich thraenhardt , a leading migration expert who is currently a fellow at the transatlantic academy in washington .
he clearly favors the spanish incentive model for migrants .
" i think it makes sense as long as migrants are free to chose .
some migrants may want to return home and if you take for instance the funding from spain back to romania you can live better there .
but other migrants will want to stay and as long as they can chose i think it 's a good policy , " he says .
but as jemini pandya , spokeswoman for the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in geneva points out , the response to the spanish initiative has n't been dramatic .
most migrants think twice before they leave the country to which they came - often enduring considerable hardships on the way .
they know that once they go back to their home country , it will be hard to return again .
difficult data to ascertain in concrete terms how migrants are affected by the economic crisis is not easy .
many countries simply do n't have the tools to accurately document the flows of migrant workers and their financial situation in real-time , says pandya .
often it can take years until reliable data is gathered .
one of the best documented , current and most vivid examples showing how migrants are affected directly by the economic meltdown comes out of mexico .
according to the country 's central bank , the amount of money sent home by mexicans working abroad dropped by 19 percent in april of this year compared to the same month the previous year .
it was the steepest decline of so called remittances on record .
for mexico , which ranks third among countries receiving the highest remittances , the loss in revenue from abroad is significant .
the money sent home from mexicans working predominently in the united states amounted to roughly 25 billion dollars last year .
it is the country 's second largest source of income after oil exports . some experts deduct a historic reversal of the global migration trend from those numbers as well as from figures suggesting a drop in migration to the us and other countries and an increase in migrants leaving the us and other migration destinations .
however , the iom is more cautious .
spokeswoman jemini pandya argues that just because remittances are falling , it does n't necessarily mean that migrants have left the country , instead many may be simply sending less money home and trying to weather the crisis .
what 's more , says pandya , many people who are going back are planning to do so only for up to six months .
trend continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish migrant workers left britain to head home according to the iom there is no reversal of the global migration pattern .
instead , argues pandya , each country and region must be analysed individually .
in many cases , the economic crisis is n't the sole reason why migrants go back home .
" for example polish migrant workers to the uk and ireland have been returning to poland in large numbers , even actually before the financial crisis started , because the british economy had been deteriorating and the polish economy was stronger at the time and so they had already started to go back , " she says .
the same is true for brasilians leaving europe and for workers in the gulf states returning to india , pakistan and bangladesh , adds pandya .
even with the economic crisis , the iom does n't expect the total number of global migrants to drop and estimates that there will be between 210 and 214 million migrants by the end of next year .
dietrich thraenhardt also does n't predict a reversal of the long term trend toward migration , but notes that people might be inclined to be less mobile during the economic crisis .
" when the economy gets better again the migration will resume , because the structural imbalances between the poor southern world and the rich northern world with its problematic demography are still there and so the rich world needs labor from the poor world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trend toward international migration continues despite the crisis and when that happens , countries like britain , australia or malaysia , which have now scaled back the number of skilled and unskilled workers they let in , will have to ease their restrictions again .
because ultimately the fundamental labor shortages in these and many other countries can not be filled by domestic workers - even during an economic crisis , says jemini pandya : " migration never stops . "

a two-day eu conference in berlin will discuss methods to monitor migratory trends within europe . for decades the nations of the expanded european union , now comprising 27 countries , have wrangled over the integration of the eu ’ s 30 million foreign residents .
the question : how to deal with those who try to enter what human rights advocates call fortress europe ? at the berlin conference the catchwords will be “ monitoring ” and “ benchmarking , ” in other words , how to measure the success or failure of efforts to integrate so-called “ legal migrants ” across europe . residents with foreign passports make up about five percent of the eu ’ s total population of nearly 500 million .
luxembourg excels , with 38 percent of its population listed as foreigners .
germany is in mid-field at 8.9 percent or about seven-million foreign residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration policies diverge widely within the eu the german federal statistics office pointed out recently , however , that the underlying trend is far greater .
it counted those with “ migratory backgrounds , ” including persons who have adopted german citizenship and children raised in families with origins abroad .
the count soared to 15 million , or more than 18 percent of germany ’ s total population of 82 million . since the 1980s , go-it-alone policies pursued by individual nations have been superseded by an eu commission drive to coordinate a patchwork of policies on asylum and integration under a so-called global approach to migration .
adopted in 2007 , its measures range from promoting language acquisition and job skills among newcomers , to worker mobility within the eu ’ s visa-free internal borders , to frontex , the eu agency which patrols waters off northern africa . frontex often draws criticism from non-governmental organizations .
scenes of would-be migrants struggling ashore from sunken boats and recovered bodies prompted eu commission president jose manuel borroso last week to call for a summit of eu mediterranean states . aging eu will need younger workers the head of the eu ’ s social and economic committee mario sepi concedes that the demographics of an ageing eu population have also prompted europe ’ s nations to boost their efforts to successfully integrate foreigners .
by 2050 a third of the eu ’ s population will be 65 years or older , requiring many younger skilled workers including foreigners , and as taxpayers , to fill the gap . “ the european model of integration is a very broad model , " sepi said .
" and , if we ’ re unable to integrate new citizens into the eu , then we wouldn ’ t be true to what our message to the world is : integration at -lrb- the -rrb- national , social and economic levels . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister schaeuble puts the onus on immigrants ahead of the eu ’ s berlin conference , chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble , of her conservative christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , praised the integrative efforts of more than two million so-called russian-germans who have resettled in germany since the collapse of the former soviet union . schaeuble also insisted that potential immigrants had to make the first steps . “ if you know nothing about where you live or where you ’ re going to and if you don ’ t have a basic knowledge of the language , then you ’ ll have only a small chance of making it in the new country . ” do n't exclude skilled migrants but associations representing foreigners in germany and the dgb trade union federation have advocated an alternative migration concept for 2009 , germany ’ s super election year .
one group , pro-asylum , says recruitment of skilled migrants should not lead to situations where refugees find it increasingly difficult to obtain asylum in the european union . experts , including staff at the sinus social research institute in heidelberg , say the migratory policies and trends across the eu ’ s 27 nations are very diverse .
even the terminology “ migrant ” and “ foreigner ” are interpreted differently from country-to-country . in a recent study , sinus researchers carsten wippermann and berthold bodo flaig dismissed negative cliches of supposedly uneducated gastarbeiter or " guest workers " recruited by germany in the 1960s , mostly from turkey . german integration three decades of research had instead shown that many migrants in germany are educationally and vocationally advanced , with a strong work ethic and modern attitudes , they said . " among a broad cross-section of the migrant population there is a high degree of cultural adaption and willingness to integrate .
many have a bicultural self-definition .
that means , they don ’ t even regard themselves as ' migrants ' but as an obvious part of german society , " the researchers said . those results are reflected in a new study by germany ’ s allensbach research institute .

a two-day eu conference in berlin will discuss methods to monitor migratory trends within europe . for decades the nations of the expanded european union , now comprising 27 countries , have wrangled over the integration of the eu ’ s 30 million foreign residents .
the question : how to deal with those who try to enter what human rights advocates call fortress europe ? at the berlin conference the catchwords will be “ monitoring ” and “ benchmarking , ” in other words , how to measure the success or failure of efforts to integrate so-called “ legal migrants ” across europe . residents with foreign passports make up about five percent of the eu ’ s total population of nearly 500 million .
luxembourg excels , with 38 percent of its population listed as foreigners .
germany is in mid-field at 8.9 percent or about seven-million foreign residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration policies diverge widely within the eu the german federal statistics office pointed out recently , however , that the underlying trend is far greater .
it counted those with “ migratory backgrounds , ” including persons who have adopted german citizenship and children raised in families with origins abroad .
the count soared to 15 million , or more than 18 percent of germany ’ s total population of 82 million . since the 1980s , go-it-alone policies pursued by individual nations have been superseded by an eu commission drive to coordinate a patchwork of policies on asylum and integration under a so-called global approach to migration .
adopted in 2007 , its measures range from promoting language acquisition and job skills among newcomers , to worker mobility within the eu ’ s visa-free internal borders , to frontex , the eu agency which patrols waters off northern africa . frontex often draws criticism from non-governmental organizations .
scenes of would-be migrants struggling ashore from sunken boats and recovered bodies prompted eu commission president jose manuel borroso last week to call for a summit of eu mediterranean states . aging eu will need younger workers the head of the eu ’ s social and economic committee mario sepi concedes that the demographics of an ageing eu population have also prompted europe ’ s nations to boost their efforts to successfully integrate foreigners .
by 2050 a third of the eu ’ s population will be 65 years or older , requiring many younger skilled workers including foreigners , and as taxpayers , to fill the gap . “ the european model of integration is a very broad model , " sepi said .
" and , if we ’ re unable to integrate new citizens into the eu , then we wouldn ’ t be true to what our message to the world is : integration at -lrb- the -rrb- national , social and economic levels . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister schaeuble puts the onus on immigrants ahead of the eu ’ s berlin conference , chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble , of her conservative christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , praised the integrative efforts of more than two million so-called russian-germans who have resettled in germany since the collapse of the former soviet union . schaeuble also insisted that potential immigrants had to make the first steps . “ if you know nothing about where you live or where you ’ re going to and if you don ’ t have a basic knowledge of the language , then you ’ ll have only a small chance of making it in the new country . ” do n't exclude skilled migrants but associations representing foreigners in germany and the dgb trade union federation have advocated an alternative migration concept for 2009 , germany ’ s super election year .
one group , pro-asylum , says recruitment of skilled migrants should not lead to situations where refugees find it increasingly difficult to obtain asylum in the european union . experts , including staff at the sinus social research institute in heidelberg , say the migratory policies and trends across the eu ’ s 27 nations are very diverse .
even the terminology “ migrant ” and “ foreigner ” are interpreted differently from country-to-country . in a recent study , sinus researchers carsten wippermann and berthold bodo flaig dismissed negative cliches of supposedly uneducated gastarbeiter or " guest workers " recruited by germany in the 1960s , mostly from turkey . german integration three decades of research had instead shown that many migrants in germany are educationally and vocationally advanced , with a strong work ethic and modern attitudes , they said . " among a broad cross-section of the migrant population there is a high degree of cultural adaption and willingness to integrate .
many have a bicultural self-definition .

" i have today , with some european colleagues , already told iran to immediately make clear whether the election results announced can be taken seriously or not , " he said . steinmeier also said that he had summoned iran 's ambassador to the foreign ministry to discuss the " brutal actions " iran 's security forces have used against protesters . " we are looking towards tehran with great concern at the moment .
there are a lot of reports of electoral fraud . " said steinmeier in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster , ard . eu officials also expresssed their reservations about the results of the polling in tehran . " the presidency is concerned about alleged irregularities during the election and post-election violence that broke out immediately after the release of the official election results on 13 june 2009 , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " the presidency expects the new government of the islamic republic of iran will take its responsibility towards the international community and respect its international obligations , " it said , adding that the eu still hoped to resume dialogue with tehran over its disputed nuclear program . correspondents hampered in reporting efforts on sunday , the news division heads of german television networks zdf and ard filed a protest with the iranian ambassador about restrictions placed on their reporters . according to a joint letter sent by thomas baumann of ard and nikolaus brender of zdf , their correspondents were deliberately hampered in their ability to report the events from tehran . they specifically mentioned ard correspondent peter metzger , who was prevented from leaving his hotel room in tehran , and zdf reporter halim hosny along with his staff who had been forbidden to report details of the election . disputed results official results show that president ahmadinejad was re-elected with more than 62 percent of the vote .
defeated candidate mir hossein mousavi formally appealed against the result on sunday to the legislative body , the guardian council , a statement on his website said .
" today , i have submitted my official formal request to the council to cancel the election result , " mousavi said in the statement .
" i urge you iranian nation to continue your nationwide protests in a peaceful and legal way . "
mousavi urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against the " rigged " election , alleging widespread irregularities in the polls .
critics of the poll say many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi appealed to his supporters to reject violence mousavi also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign used to reach young , urban voters .
ahmadinejad defended his victory at a mass rally in tehran on sunday , saying the election was fair .
" some inside or outside iran have come out and said the elections have been distorted .
where is the distortion in the election ? "
" their -lrb- western -rrb- standpoint is if the candidate they propagated does not win , then there has definitely been cheating , " he said .
post-election violence protests against ahmadinejad 's landslide election victory turned violent on saturday as supporters of reformist presidential candidate , mir hossein mousavi , clashed with police in the iranian capital in the worst scenes of violence since the 1979 islamic revolution .
riot police patrolled the streets of tehran as thousands of opposition supporters took part in demonstrations in iran 's capital , defying police warnings .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 62.6 percent of votes against 33.7 percent for mousavi in a record 85 percent turnout .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 15.06.2009 eu conference on migration and integration kicks off in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border control is among the issues to be discussed at the conference how well is europe coping with the integration of its foreign residents ?
a two-day eu conference in berlin will discuss methods to monitor migratory trends within europe . for decades the nations of the expanded european union , now comprising 27 countries , have wrangled over the integration of the eu ’ s 30 million foreign residents .
the question : how to deal with those who try to enter what human rights advocates call fortress europe ? at the berlin conference the catchwords will be “ monitoring ” and “ benchmarking , ” in other words , how to measure the success or failure of efforts to integrate so-called “ legal migrants ” across europe . residents with foreign passports make up about five percent of the eu ’ s total population of nearly 500 million .
luxembourg excels , with 38 percent of its population listed as foreigners .
germany is in mid-field at 8.9 percent or about seven-million foreign residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration policies diverge widely within the eu the german federal statistics office pointed out recently , however , that the underlying trend is far greater .
it counted those with “ migratory backgrounds , ” including persons who have adopted german citizenship and children raised in families with origins abroad .
the count soared to 15 million , or more than 18 percent of germany ’ s total population of 82 million . since the 1980s , go-it-alone policies pursued by individual nations have been superseded by an eu commission drive to coordinate a patchwork of policies on asylum and integration under a so-called global approach to migration .
adopted in 2007 , its measures range from promoting language acquisition and job skills among newcomers , to worker mobility within the eu ’ s visa-free internal borders , to frontex , the eu agency which patrols waters off northern africa . frontex often draws criticism from non-governmental organizations .
scenes of would-be migrants struggling ashore from sunken boats and recovered bodies prompted eu commission president jose manuel borroso last week to call for a summit of eu mediterranean states . aging eu will need younger workers the head of the eu ’ s social and economic committee mario sepi concedes that the demographics of an ageing eu population have also prompted europe ’ s nations to boost their efforts to successfully integrate foreigners .
by 2050 a third of the eu ’ s population will be 65 years or older , requiring many younger skilled workers including foreigners , and as taxpayers , to fill the gap . “ the european model of integration is a very broad model , " sepi said .
" and , if we ’ re unable to integrate new citizens into the eu , then we wouldn ’ t be true to what our message to the world is : integration at -lrb- the -rrb- national , social and economic levels . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister schaeuble puts the onus on immigrants ahead of the eu ’ s berlin conference , chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble , of her conservative christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , praised the integrative efforts of more than two million so-called russian-germans who have resettled in germany since the collapse of the former soviet union . schaeuble also insisted that potential immigrants had to make the first steps . “ if you know nothing about where you live or where you ’ re going to and if you don ’ t have a basic knowledge of the language , then you ’ ll have only a small chance of making it in the new country . ” do n't exclude skilled migrants but associations representing foreigners in germany and the dgb trade union federation have advocated an alternative migration concept for 2009 , germany ’ s super election year .
one group , pro-asylum , says recruitment of skilled migrants should not lead to situations where refugees find it increasingly difficult to obtain asylum in the european union . experts , including staff at the sinus social research institute in heidelberg , say the migratory policies and trends across the eu ’ s 27 nations are very diverse .
even the terminology “ migrant ” and “ foreigner ” are interpreted differently from country-to-country . in a recent study , sinus researchers carsten wippermann and berthold bodo flaig dismissed negative cliches of supposedly uneducated gastarbeiter or " guest workers " recruited by germany in the 1960s , mostly from turkey . german integration three decades of research had instead shown that many migrants in germany are educationally and vocationally advanced , with a strong work ethic and modern attitudes , they said . " among a broad cross-section of the migrant population there is a high degree of cultural adaption and willingness to integrate .
many have a bicultural self-definition .
that means , they don ’ t even regard themselves as ' migrants ' but as an obvious part of german society , " the researchers said . those results are reflected in a new study by germany ’ s allensbach research institute .
it says 69 percent of migrants feel comfortable in germany ; and 58 percent regard themselves as part of german society .
amongst turkish migrants , however , a quarter said they still felt as if they were foreign or different . ipj / epd / kna / bpb / apuz / eurostats editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are often the first ones to lose their jobs , face pay cuts and harder working conditions .
still , even the current crisis wo n't stop the trend toward migration . as the economic malaise deepens and shows no clear signs of abating anytime soon , many countries around the world are turning up the pressure on migrants in an effort to ease the strain on the local labor market .
japan , a nation with few migrant laborers to begin with , introduced a program that offers latin american guest workers of japanese ancestry cash incentives if they leave the country .
in europe , spain and the czech republic are also trying to persuade workers from outside the european union to go back home by paying them money to do so .
while japan 's program bars workers who participate from returning to the country , spain 's program allows migrants to come back after three years under the condition that they have a specific work contract . it 's a natural impulse that countries are looking at curbing the number of migrant workers in times of economic turmoil , says dietrich thraenhardt , a leading migration expert who is currently a fellow at the transatlantic academy in washington .
he clearly favors the spanish incentive model for migrants .
" i think it makes sense as long as migrants are free to chose .
some migrants may want to return home and if you take for instance the funding from spain back to romania you can live better there .
but other migrants will want to stay and as long as they can chose i think it 's a good policy , " he says .
but as jemini pandya , spokeswoman for the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in geneva points out , the response to the spanish initiative has n't been dramatic .
most migrants think twice before they leave the country to which they came - often enduring considerable hardships on the way .
they know that once they go back to their home country , it will be hard to return again .
difficult data to ascertain in concrete terms how migrants are affected by the economic crisis is not easy .
many countries simply do n't have the tools to accurately document the flows of migrant workers and their financial situation in real-time , says pandya .
often it can take years until reliable data is gathered .
one of the best documented , current and most vivid examples showing how migrants are affected directly by the economic meltdown comes out of mexico .
according to the country 's central bank , the amount of money sent home by mexicans working abroad dropped by 19 percent in april of this year compared to the same month the previous year .
it was the steepest decline of so called remittances on record .
for mexico , which ranks third among countries receiving the highest remittances , the loss in revenue from abroad is significant .
the money sent home from mexicans working predominently in the united states amounted to roughly 25 billion dollars last year .
it is the country 's second largest source of income after oil exports . some experts deduct a historic reversal of the global migration trend from those numbers as well as from figures suggesting a drop in migration to the us and other countries and an increase in migrants leaving the us and other migration destinations .
however , the iom is more cautious .
spokeswoman jemini pandya argues that just because remittances are falling , it does n't necessarily mean that migrants have left the country , instead many may be simply sending less money home and trying to weather the crisis .
what 's more , says pandya , many people who are going back are planning to do so only for up to six months .
trend continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish migrant workers left britain to head home according to the iom there is no reversal of the global migration pattern .
instead , argues pandya , each country and region must be analysed individually .
in many cases , the economic crisis is n't the sole reason why migrants go back home .
" for example polish migrant workers to the uk and ireland have been returning to poland in large numbers , even actually before the financial crisis started , because the british economy had been deteriorating and the polish economy was stronger at the time and so they had already started to go back , " she says .
the same is true for brasilians leaving europe and for workers in the gulf states returning to india , pakistan and bangladesh , adds pandya .
even with the economic crisis , the iom does n't expect the total number of global migrants to drop and estimates that there will be between 210 and 214 million migrants by the end of next year .
dietrich thraenhardt also does n't predict a reversal of the long term trend toward migration , but notes that people might be inclined to be less mobile during the economic crisis .
" when the economy gets better again the migration will resume , because the structural imbalances between the poor southern world and the rich northern world with its problematic demography are still there and so the rich world needs labor from the poor world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trend toward international migration continues despite the crisis and when that happens , countries like britain , australia or malaysia , which have now scaled back the number of skilled and unskilled workers they let in , will have to ease their restrictions again .
because ultimately the fundamental labor shortages in these and many other countries can not be filled by domestic workers - even during an economic crisis , says jemini pandya : " migration never stops . "

they are often the first ones to lose their jobs , face pay cuts and harder working conditions .
still , even the current crisis wo n't stop the trend toward migration . as the economic malaise deepens and shows no clear signs of abating anytime soon , many countries around the world are turning up the pressure on migrants in an effort to ease the strain on the local labor market .
japan , a nation with few migrant laborers to begin with , introduced a program that offers latin american guest workers of japanese ancestry cash incentives if they leave the country .
in europe , spain and the czech republic are also trying to persuade workers from outside the european union to go back home by paying them money to do so .
while japan 's program bars workers who participate from returning to the country , spain 's program allows migrants to come back after three years under the condition that they have a specific work contract . it 's a natural impulse that countries are looking at curbing the number of migrant workers in times of economic turmoil , says dietrich thraenhardt , a leading migration expert who is currently a fellow at the transatlantic academy in washington .
he clearly favors the spanish incentive model for migrants .
" i think it makes sense as long as migrants are free to chose .
some migrants may want to return home and if you take for instance the funding from spain back to romania you can live better there .
but other migrants will want to stay and as long as they can chose i think it 's a good policy , " he says .
but as jemini pandya , spokeswoman for the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in geneva points out , the response to the spanish initiative has n't been dramatic .
most migrants think twice before they leave the country to which they came - often enduring considerable hardships on the way .
they know that once they go back to their home country , it will be hard to return again .
difficult data to ascertain in concrete terms how migrants are affected by the economic crisis is not easy .
many countries simply do n't have the tools to accurately document the flows of migrant workers and their financial situation in real-time , says pandya .
often it can take years until reliable data is gathered .
one of the best documented , current and most vivid examples showing how migrants are affected directly by the economic meltdown comes out of mexico .
according to the country 's central bank , the amount of money sent home by mexicans working abroad dropped by 19 percent in april of this year compared to the same month the previous year .
it was the steepest decline of so called remittances on record .
for mexico , which ranks third among countries receiving the highest remittances , the loss in revenue from abroad is significant .
the money sent home from mexicans working predominently in the united states amounted to roughly 25 billion dollars last year .
it is the country 's second largest source of income after oil exports . some experts deduct a historic reversal of the global migration trend from those numbers as well as from figures suggesting a drop in migration to the us and other countries and an increase in migrants leaving the us and other migration destinations .
however , the iom is more cautious .
spokeswoman jemini pandya argues that just because remittances are falling , it does n't necessarily mean that migrants have left the country , instead many may be simply sending less money home and trying to weather the crisis .
what 's more , says pandya , many people who are going back are planning to do so only for up to six months .
trend continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish migrant workers left britain to head home according to the iom there is no reversal of the global migration pattern .
instead , argues pandya , each country and region must be analysed individually .
in many cases , the economic crisis is n't the sole reason why migrants go back home .
" for example polish migrant workers to the uk and ireland have been returning to poland in large numbers , even actually before the financial crisis started , because the british economy had been deteriorating and the polish economy was stronger at the time and so they had already started to go back , " she says .
the same is true for brasilians leaving europe and for workers in the gulf states returning to india , pakistan and bangladesh , adds pandya .
even with the economic crisis , the iom does n't expect the total number of global migrants to drop and estimates that there will be between 210 and 214 million migrants by the end of next year .
dietrich thraenhardt also does n't predict a reversal of the long term trend toward migration , but notes that people might be inclined to be less mobile during the economic crisis .
" when the economy gets better again the migration will resume , because the structural imbalances between the poor southern world and the rich northern world with its problematic demography are still there and so the rich world needs labor from the poor world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trend toward international migration continues despite the crisis and when that happens , countries like britain , australia or malaysia , which have now scaled back the number of skilled and unskilled workers they let in , will have to ease their restrictions again .
because ultimately the fundamental labor shortages in these and many other countries can not be filled by domestic workers - even during an economic crisis , says jemini pandya : " migration never stops . "

while opposition supporters protest the election results that put president mahmoud ahmadinejad back in office , international news organizations say they are being prevented from reporting on the escalating events . german public broadcasters zdf and ard say their journalists are being prevented from doing their jobs , with the zdf team barred from reporting and ard correspondent peter mezger no longer allowed to leave his hotel .
the journalist told the bayrischer rundfunk television network that the situation had escalated after ahmadinejad accused foreign press of blowing the demonstrations out of proportion .
metzger said militiamen had taken the president 's words as a call to action and had clamped down on international media as a result .
he said a group of six men had appeared in the ard office in tehran armed with truncheons and electronic shock devices , and had taken one of his colleagues with them .
his whereabouts is still unkown .
in a letter to the iranian ambassador in berlin , the editors-in-chief of the two stations , said : “ we see a breach of freedom of the press and democratic principles . ”
they insisted , however , that they would continue to report in a “ critical , fair and independent ” manner .
electronic jamming the bbc has also reported difficulties .
it says the satellites it uses for its persian radio and television services have been affected by “ heavy electronic jamming ” which was becoming “ progressively worse . ”
technicians have traced the jam back to iran .
bildunterschrift : broadcasters want the freedom to report on what is happening director of the bbc world service , peter horrocks , said that any attempt to block its broadcasts was “ wrong and against international treaties on satellite communication . ”
he added that it appeared to be “ part of a pattern of behavior by the iranian authorities to limit the reporting of the aftermath of the disputed election . ”
the ap news agency said it had been told by government representatives not to deliver any footage to the bbc persian service , which is very popular in iran , or to voice of america .
whatever it takes a dutch television crew for public broadcaster nederland 2 said one of its journalists and cameramen had been arrested while filming outside the headquarters of ahmadinejad 's closest challenger , mir hossein mousavi .
“ they were pushed against a wall and their tapes were seized .
their filming permits were withdrawn and they had to leave the country immediately , ” nederland 2 said in a statement .
the arab news station al-arabiya was shut down for a week , while a spanish journalist also reported the confiscation of footage of some of the post-election protests .
press inside iran has shown very little sign of the ongoing unrest and an editor of the pro-mousavi newspaper kalemeh sabs said the authorities had forbidden the distribution of the paper on sunday .
deeply concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has called for clarity over iran elections meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has expressed his concern about the mounting tension in tehran and has summoned the iranian ambassador .
in an interview with zdf television on sunday night , he said the accusations of election fraud had to be clarified " immediately and without delay . "
steinmeier also criticized the police violence towards pro-opposition demonstrators . " the actions of the iranian security forces are completely unacceptable , " he said , adding that berlin was watching teheran " with great concern .

now she tells deutsche welle she hopes the protest movement against it succeeds - and stays peaceful . deutsche welle : what 's been your experience over the past few days ?
shahla lahiji : many , many people , not just young but middle aged and some old people , participated in the demonstrations , and last night -lrb- sunday -rrb- they attacked the campus of the students in the tehran university .
they beat them badly and took 400 students .
where they are now , we do n't know .
many within iran have said that this election stirred up more popular enthusiasm than others have . why is that ?
well , it 's the first time in our constitutional history that the wishes and hopes of the people came to something real from the candidates .
and that was one of the reasons that so many people participated .
before , many said that they would not participate in any kind of vote anymore .
this time they participated because they mentioned the freedoms that the people wanted .
and maybe it 's the reason that what happened when the results came out took place , because people knew that they were not honest and not correct , that something happened .
so it is your belief that the official result is false ?
it 's not my belief , it 's the belief of all the people who were in the streets being attacked by -lsb- basij -rsb- guards and police !
you have had a role in protest movements in the past … oh yes , i 'm one of the people who went to the berlin conference -lsb- “ iran after the elections ” -ed . -rsb- , and i went to prison for it , like mehrangiz kar or akbar ganji .
because i was against censorship .
if you go into the internet you will find a lot on my story , my life , my biography ...
yes , and the protest movement of that era , that of summer 1999 and thereafter , was eventually crushed by the government .
do you see parallels between then and now ?
yes , because what was being offered by the candidates could not be accepted by this regime .
they could not let them do this and want this , and they would not let the candidates talk like that and offer this to people .
so we knew that something would happen .
i could foresee this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi is becoming a folk hero are there parallels between what is happening now and the movement of 1978-9 .
a movement in which people are n't just criticizing one politician , or one action , they 're criticizing the whole system .
no , i am not saying that they wanted to overthrow the regime , they wanted very serious reform .
about personal freedom , human rights , and women 's rights .
they did n't like what was being done to women on the streets over the past four years by the -lsb- basij -rsb- guards , and they wanted normal contact with the world .
people may have been voting for reform of the system , but if this system has now failed them , if it has refused to listen to them , are they now going to go against the system itself ?
yes , that 's why there are so many protests !
where can this go then , if this is the people against the system ?
i do n't know , but i hope that they can continue with their demonstrations in a quiet and calm way and i hope that it does n't turn to violence because i know , if it does , it will be crushed down badly .
as they did last night in the university campus .
and now you know there is a demonstration going on that had not been allowed between two very important squares in tehran -lsb- revolution and freedom squares – ed . -rsb- and i am not participating because my legs have problems and i knew that i could not walk all that way.i hope it wo n't become violent , because i 'm sure that wo n't bring a good result .
do you think that will happen ?
well they do n't want to let the people do this .
and both sides have called this a coup d 'état – not just the protestors .
the government says it 's a “ color revolution , ” because mousavi 's supporters ' color is green , like the orange revolution in ukraine or the rose revolution in georgia and i do n't know where else .
do you expect … do you know my phone is under their control ?
you know i 'm taking a big risk to talk to you like this ... i think this is enough !
okay , then it 's enough !

now she tells deutsche welle she hopes the protest movement against it succeeds - and stays peaceful . deutsche welle : what 's been your experience over the past few days ?
shahla lahiji : many , many people , not just young but middle aged and some old people , participated in the demonstrations , and last night -lrb- sunday -rrb- they attacked the campus of the students in the tehran university .
they beat them badly and took 400 students .
where they are now , we do n't know .
many within iran have said that this election stirred up more popular enthusiasm than others have . why is that ?
well , it 's the first time in our constitutional history that the wishes and hopes of the people came to something real from the candidates .
and that was one of the reasons that so many people participated .
before , many said that they would not participate in any kind of vote anymore .
this time they participated because they mentioned the freedoms that the people wanted .
and maybe it 's the reason that what happened when the results came out took place , because people knew that they were not honest and not correct , that something happened .
so it is your belief that the official result is false ?
it 's not my belief , it 's the belief of all the people who were in the streets being attacked by -lsb- basij -rsb- guards and police !
you have had a role in protest movements in the past … oh yes , i 'm one of the people who went to the berlin conference -lsb- “ iran after the elections ” -ed . -rsb- , and i went to prison for it , like mehrangiz kar or akbar ganji .
because i was against censorship .
if you go into the internet you will find a lot on my story , my life , my biography ...
yes , and the protest movement of that era , that of summer 1999 and thereafter , was eventually crushed by the government .
do you see parallels between then and now ?
yes , because what was being offered by the candidates could not be accepted by this regime .
they could not let them do this and want this , and they would not let the candidates talk like that and offer this to people .
so we knew that something would happen .
i could foresee this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi is becoming a folk hero are there parallels between what is happening now and the movement of 1978-9 .
a movement in which people are n't just criticizing one politician , or one action , they 're criticizing the whole system .
no , i am not saying that they wanted to overthrow the regime , they wanted very serious reform .
about personal freedom , human rights , and women 's rights .
they did n't like what was being done to women on the streets over the past four years by the -lsb- basij -rsb- guards , and they wanted normal contact with the world .
people may have been voting for reform of the system , but if this system has now failed them , if it has refused to listen to them , are they now going to go against the system itself ?
yes , that 's why there are so many protests !
where can this go then , if this is the people against the system ?
i do n't know , but i hope that they can continue with their demonstrations in a quiet and calm way and i hope that it does n't turn to violence because i know , if it does , it will be crushed down badly .
as they did last night in the university campus .
and now you know there is a demonstration going on that had not been allowed between two very important squares in tehran -lsb- revolution and freedom squares – ed . -rsb- and i am not participating because my legs have problems and i knew that i could not walk all that way.i hope it wo n't become violent , because i 'm sure that wo n't bring a good result .
do you think that will happen ?
well they do n't want to let the people do this .
and both sides have called this a coup d 'état – not just the protestors .
the government says it 's a “ color revolution , ” because mousavi 's supporters ' color is green , like the orange revolution in ukraine or the rose revolution in georgia and i do n't know where else .
do you expect … do you know my phone is under their control ?
you know i 'm taking a big risk to talk to you like this ... i think this is enough !
okay , then it 's enough !

" are we too dependent on exports ?
i believe there is no alternative to being a country with strong exports , " merkel told a conference hosted by germany 's main industry association , the bdi .
" otherwise we are putting our standard of living at risk , " she said .
merkel 's remarks came in response to warnings from economists that a slump in global trade meant that germany should take steps to boost domestic demand to offset falling foreign orders , and reduce the nation 's reliance on export markets .
germany is the world 's biggest exporter of goods , with particular strengths in the machinery , chemicals and auto sectors .
its manufacturers have been hit hard by a collapse in demand caused by the global financial crisis .
officials in berlin expect the german economy to shrink by around six percent this year , the second biggest slump among advanced economies after japan .
chancellor merkel told business delegates that the scale of the economic crisis meant world leaders must press on with the global market reforms the group of 20 leading industrial and emerging economies agreed to march this year . " we have to work further on the rules with a continuing effort , " she said .
election : what election ?
speakers at the conference in berlin included leading politicians – eager to highlight their political messages ahead of general elections in september .
chancellor angela merkel also used the conference to defend her policy of providing state aid for ailing companies . her conservative-led coalition government has faced mounting criticism for supporting general motors ' european unit opel , but turning down a bailout for the troubled german retail and tour group arcandor ag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bdi president keitel says german taxpayers should not pay for management failings opel , merkel said , was a special case , while insolvency would help lay the ground for restructuring arcandor , which operates germany 's karstadt department store chain . merkel said arcandor had been in trouble before the crisis hit germany last year , so it is not entitled to receive funds and loan guarantees .
arcandor filed for insolvency last week .
" i would n't have decided differently if germany had not been in an election campaign , " merkel told the bdi convention .
parliamentary elections are scheduled for september 27 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is merkel 's social democratic challenger for the chancellorship , said governments must be prepared to step in to help save jobs .
" to me , it concerns the future of this nation and the economy , " steinmeier told the industry delegates in berlin .
a highly risky strategy bdi president hans-peter keitel said he hoped that the government 's strategy in rescuing carmaker opel would remain an exception to the rule .
" the german taxpayer must not end up footing the bill for grave management blunders , " he said .
keitel also said the government 's economic policy should not be driven by populist efforts to win votes .
" by deciding to rescue opel , the government has displayed a kind of behaviour that it sometimes likes to accuse us business people of . "
this was a highly risky strategy that might cost the taxpayer dearly in the end , keitel added .
the bdi president also said there must be limits for industry demands for state assistance .
" we should not try to make it is easy for us by turning to the government in times of crisis , " he said. db / sje / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a joint statement , eu ministers agreed that " piracy off the coast of somalia is likely to remain a serious threat . "
the extension was made now because " early agreement on extending the operation would facilitate the necessary force generation . "
international navies have deployed dozens of warships around the gulf of aden over the past year in a attempt to curb attacks by pirates threatening the busy maritime trade route .
operation atalanta currently consists of 14 ships and three aircraft .
the german contribution consists of a total of 650 personnel , two warships , one supply ship and one reconnaissance plane .
the german frigate brandenburg left the port of wilhelmshaven on monday to relieve one of the vessels already in the gulf of aden .
the parliamentary mandate for german forces deployed on the mission expires at the end of 2009 .
it is not yet clear whether that mandate will be extended to allow for further involvement now that atalanta has been prolonged .
the eu mission , which draws on forces from germany , belgium , britain , france , italy , greece , the netherlands , spain and sweden , has been operational since december 2008 .
naval officers at the mission 's headquarters in northwood , london , say atalanta forces have arrested about 70 pirates so far .
they have also escorted 28 ships chartered by the world food program on aid delivery missions throughout the region. sje / ap / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a joint statement , eu ministers agreed that " piracy off the coast of somalia is likely to remain a serious threat . "
the extension was made now because " early agreement on extending the operation would facilitate the necessary force generation . "
international navies have deployed dozens of warships around the gulf of aden over the past year in a attempt to curb attacks by pirates threatening the busy maritime trade route .
operation atalanta currently consists of 14 ships and three aircraft .
the german contribution consists of a total of 650 personnel , two warships , one supply ship and one reconnaissance plane .
the german frigate brandenburg left the port of wilhelmshaven on monday to relieve one of the vessels already in the gulf of aden .
the parliamentary mandate for german forces deployed on the mission expires at the end of 2009 .
it is not yet clear whether that mandate will be extended to allow for further involvement now that atalanta has been prolonged .
the eu mission , which draws on forces from germany , belgium , britain , france , italy , greece , the netherlands , spain and sweden , has been operational since december 2008 .
naval officers at the mission 's headquarters in northwood , london , say atalanta forces have arrested about 70 pirates so far .
they have also escorted 28 ships chartered by the world food program on aid delivery missions throughout the region. sje / ap / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and for the first time since 1999 , he said , there were fewer crimes of violence last year : they were down by 3.2 percent to 211,000 .
" that proves germany is a safe country , " schaeuble said , noting that about 54 percent of all crimes are solved – a rate that has remained almost unchanged over the years .
according to the statistics , the number of thefts reached a record low last year ; cases of thefts from vehicles were even down by more than 19 percent , while juvenile delinquency decreased by almost six percent .
this development , schaeuble said , is in part due to an increase in preventive measures .
the interior minister conceded it was too soon for an all- clear , but said that “ there is hope for a change in the trend . ”
a positive development – but no trend ulrich maeurer , interior minister of the tiny northern state of bremen , presented the statistics alongside schaeuble .
he warned that there is still a high level of violence in the country , and stressed that he did not believe the new data marked a turnaround .
he pointed to the situation in cities with problematic urban areas . here , the 2008 statistics record 72,904 cases of assault in public areas – an increase of 9.1 percent compared to 2007 .
violence against police has risen as well – to a record 28.272 cases in 2008 .
frankfurt / main and hannover recorded the most crimes , berlin was ranked sixth .
40 percent of all the cases registered by police are thefts , 14.5 percent fraud and scams , and 13.1 percent damage to property .
in one out of three violent crimes solved by police , alcohol was involved. db / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the statistics , the number of thefts reached a record low last year ; cases of thefts from vehicles were even down by more than 19 percent , while juvenile delinquency decreased by almost six percent .

the exhibition brings together leading aviation experts and business leaders from around the world .
but the mood of the air show is far from festive . the paris air show is held every two years at the le bourget airport just outside paris and is traditionally a place where contracts with airline manufacturers are inked .
but deals like the one announced monday by qatar airways for 24 airbus a320 jets are likely to be the exception at this year 's paris air show in light of the global economic recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar airways has ordered 24 airbus a320 aircraft european aircraft manufacturer airbus and american aviation company boeing are among the companies hardest hit by the global recession .
even if new orders come in , they wo n't necessarily mean a light at the end of the tunnel for either company .
many new purchases are offset by cancellations of previous deals made during the peak of an aviation industry boom , which occurred around the last paris air show two years ago .
delivery delays additionally , both companies are struggling to deliver on the large backlog of orders they still have .
the airbus a400m military transporter , which was originally scheduled for delivery at the beginning of this year , has seen major delays .
the future of the 20-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- project is at risk as some clients have threatened to cancel their orders .
boeing 's 787 dreamliner , a fuel-efficient , long-haul aircraft , has also seen its share of delays .
speculation that the dreamliner would make its first test flight at the paris air show has been put to rest by boeing representatives attending the event , who say the test flight is scheduled for the end of the month .
future of aviation industry unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 787 ' dreamliner ' was unveiled in july 2007 , but is yet to be tested in the air statements from boeing and airbus executives reflect mixed expectations when it comes to the future of the airline industry .
scott carson , head of boeing 's commercial airplanes division , said he remained optimistic that the industry would bounce back by mid-2010 . airbus chief executive tom enders did n't go so far as to say he expected a turnaround inext year , but said that 2010 and 2011 would be critical years for the aviation sector .
on top of the grim financial future of the airline industry , many questions still surround the recent crash of an air france a330 airbus in the atlantic that claimed the lives of all 228 people on board .
the plane was scheduled to land in paris after taking off from rio de janeiro on june 1 .
despite that tragedy , and the dark clouds over the future of the airline industry , attendance at the paris air show does not appear to have suffered since 2007 .
around 2,000 exhibitors from over 40 countries are in attendance , and event organizers expect about 300,000 visitors throughout the week-long exhibition. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the exhibition brings together leading aviation experts and business leaders from around the world .
but the mood of the air show is far from festive . the paris air show is held every two years at the le bourget airport just outside paris and is traditionally a place where contracts with airline manufacturers are inked .
but deals like the one announced monday by qatar airways for 24 airbus a320 jets are likely to be the exception at this year 's paris air show in light of the global economic recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar airways has ordered 24 airbus a320 aircraft european aircraft manufacturer airbus and american aviation company boeing are among the companies hardest hit by the global recession .
even if new orders come in , they wo n't necessarily mean a light at the end of the tunnel for either company .
many new purchases are offset by cancellations of previous deals made during the peak of an aviation industry boom , which occurred around the last paris air show two years ago .
delivery delays additionally , both companies are struggling to deliver on the large backlog of orders they still have .
the airbus a400m military transporter , which was originally scheduled for delivery at the beginning of this year , has seen major delays .
the future of the 20-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- project is at risk as some clients have threatened to cancel their orders .
boeing 's 787 dreamliner , a fuel-efficient , long-haul aircraft , has also seen its share of delays .
speculation that the dreamliner would make its first test flight at the paris air show has been put to rest by boeing representatives attending the event , who say the test flight is scheduled for the end of the month .
future of aviation industry unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 787 ' dreamliner ' was unveiled in july 2007 , but is yet to be tested in the air statements from boeing and airbus executives reflect mixed expectations when it comes to the future of the airline industry .
scott carson , head of boeing 's commercial airplanes division , said he remained optimistic that the industry would bounce back by mid-2010 . airbus chief executive tom enders did n't go so far as to say he expected a turnaround inext year , but said that 2010 and 2011 would be critical years for the aviation sector .
on top of the grim financial future of the airline industry , many questions still surround the recent crash of an air france a330 airbus in the atlantic that claimed the lives of all 228 people on board .
the plane was scheduled to land in paris after taking off from rio de janeiro on june 1 .
despite that tragedy , and the dark clouds over the future of the airline industry , attendance at the paris air show does not appear to have suffered since 2007 .
around 2,000 exhibitors from over 40 countries are in attendance , and event organizers expect about 300,000 visitors throughout the week-long exhibition. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
kohout , who was in luxembourg for a meeting with his european counterparts , said there were " a number of other elements which need to be analyzed but the acceptance of the palestinian state is there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister bernard kouchner says there can be no conditions speaking to reporters in luxembourg , foreign minister to sweden , carl bildt , echoed his czech colleague 's view .
" the fact that he uttered the word ' state ' is a small step forward , " he said .
" whether what he mentioned can be defined as a -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state is a subject of some debate . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said there was still a long way to go .
" to secure peace means going well beyond that , without laying down any preconditions to negotiations , " he said .
restrictions and conditions in his televised announcement on sunday evening , the israeli prime minister said he was prepared to begin talks on several conditions including the demilitarization of any future palestinian state and israeli sovereignty over a united jerusalem .
the provisions have angered palestinians , and cypriot foreign minister markos kyprianou said they were " not what the eu expects . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu wants closer ties with the eu eu foreign ministers say that although netanyahu 's announcement is a step in the right direction , it is too soon to talk about an upgrade - a strengthening of ties - in eu-israeli relations .
luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said : " we should n't talk about an upgrade with israel if we do n't manage to unblock the -lrb- peace talks -rrb- process in a very positive way . "
the ministers agreed to the upgrade in principle last year , but the issue was sidelined in december following israel 's assault on the gaza strip .
since then , the eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner has said there will be no strengthening of ties until such time as the israeli government commits to peace talks with the palestinians .

proponents of the online survey hail it as a useful tool for patients , but doctors are firmly against it . the german association of health insurers -lrb- aok -rrb- has announced that insured patients , numbering around 24 million , will be able to grade their doctors ' performance and services in an online questionnaire starting next year .
online surveys already exist for a number of professions and industries in germany , including university professors , car-dealers , and nursing home staff , but a proposal to introduce a similar assessment tool for the medical community has caused a stir among doctors .
they fear that the design of the online survey would be overly simplistic , and could lead patients to judge doctors only on their test results , rather than on the actual quality of the treatment and care they provide .
insurance spokesperson susanne ruesberg-uhrig acknowledges the demand for a rating system for doctors , but insists that the project will only make sense if doctors and scientists can develop a " criteria catalog . "
the president of the german medical association , joerg-dietrich hoppe , is also critical , saying that it is not legitimate " to use an anonymous questionnaire as a basis for rankings . "
proponents of the online survey say it is a necessary and helpful tool for patients seeking answers to a wide range of topics while selecting a doctor , such as the length of clinic wait-times and how well a doctor listens to his or her patients. vj / ddp / ots editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

proponents of the online survey hail it as a useful tool for patients , but doctors are firmly against it . the german association of health insurers -lrb- aok -rrb- has announced that insured patients , numbering around 24 million , will be able to grade their doctors ' performance and services in an online questionnaire starting next year .
online surveys already exist for a number of professions and industries in germany , including university professors , car-dealers , and nursing home staff , but a proposal to introduce a similar assessment tool for the medical community has caused a stir among doctors .

" i have today , with some european colleagues , already told iran to immediately make clear whether the election results announced can be taken seriously or not , " he said . steinmeier also said that he had summoned iran 's ambassador to the foreign ministry to discuss the " brutal actions " iran 's security forces have used against protesters . " we are looking towards tehran with great concern at the moment .
there are a lot of reports of electoral fraud . " said steinmeier in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster , ard . eu officials also expresssed their reservations about the results of the polling in tehran . " the presidency is concerned about alleged irregularities during the election and post-election violence that broke out immediately after the release of the official election results on 13 june 2009 , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " the presidency expects the new government of the islamic republic of iran will take its responsibility towards the international community and respect its international obligations , " it said , adding that the eu still hoped to resume dialogue with tehran over its disputed nuclear program . correspondents hampered in reporting efforts on sunday , the news division heads of german television networks zdf and ard filed a protest with the iranian ambassador about restrictions placed on their reporters . according to a joint letter sent by thomas baumann of ard and nikolaus brender of zdf , their correspondents were deliberately hampered in their ability to report the events from tehran . they specifically mentioned ard correspondent peter metzger , who was prevented from leaving his hotel room in tehran , and zdf reporter halim hosny along with his staff who had been forbidden to report details of the election . disputed results official results show that president ahmadinejad was re-elected with more than 62 percent of the vote .
defeated candidate mir hossein mousavi formally appealed against the result on sunday to the legislative body , the guardian council , a statement on his website said .
" today , i have submitted my official formal request to the council to cancel the election result , " mousavi said in the statement .
" i urge you iranian nation to continue your nationwide protests in a peaceful and legal way . "
mousavi urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against the " rigged " election , alleging widespread irregularities in the polls .
critics of the poll say many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi appealed to his supporters to reject violence mousavi also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign used to reach young , urban voters .
ahmadinejad defended his victory at a mass rally in tehran on sunday , saying the election was fair .
" some inside or outside iran have come out and said the elections have been distorted .
where is the distortion in the election ? "
" their -lrb- western -rrb- standpoint is if the candidate they propagated does not win , then there has definitely been cheating , " he said .
post-election violence protests against ahmadinejad 's landslide election victory turned violent on saturday as supporters of reformist presidential candidate , mir hossein mousavi , clashed with police in the iranian capital in the worst scenes of violence since the 1979 islamic revolution .
riot police patrolled the streets of tehran as thousands of opposition supporters took part in demonstrations in iran 's capital , defying police warnings .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 62.6 percent of votes against 33.7 percent for mousavi in a record 85 percent turnout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mousavi supporters clash with police in the iranian capital supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei told iranians to respect ahmadinejad 's election , who assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear program , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .

" i have today , with some european colleagues , already told iran to immediately make clear whether the election results announced can be taken seriously or not , " he said . steinmeier also said that he had summoned iran 's ambassador to the foreign ministry to discuss the " brutal actions " iran 's security forces have used against protesters . " we are looking towards tehran with great concern at the moment .
there are a lot of reports of electoral fraud . " said steinmeier in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster , ard . eu officials also expresssed their reservations about the results of the polling in tehran . " the presidency is concerned about alleged irregularities during the election and post-election violence that broke out immediately after the release of the official election results on 13 june 2009 , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " the presidency expects the new government of the islamic republic of iran will take its responsibility towards the international community and respect its international obligations , " it said , adding that the eu still hoped to resume dialogue with tehran over its disputed nuclear program . correspondents hampered in reporting efforts on sunday , the news division heads of german television networks zdf and ard filed a protest with the iranian ambassador about restrictions placed on their reporters . according to a joint letter sent by thomas baumann of ard and nikolaus brender of zdf , their correspondents were deliberately hampered in their ability to report the events from tehran . they specifically mentioned ard correspondent peter metzger , who was prevented from leaving his hotel room in tehran , and zdf reporter halim hosny along with his staff who had been forbidden to report details of the election . disputed results official results show that president ahmadinejad was re-elected with more than 62 percent of the vote .
defeated candidate mir hossein mousavi formally appealed against the result on sunday to the legislative body , the guardian council , a statement on his website said .
" today , i have submitted my official formal request to the council to cancel the election result , " mousavi said in the statement .
" i urge you iranian nation to continue your nationwide protests in a peaceful and legal way . "
mousavi urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against the " rigged " election , alleging widespread irregularities in the polls .
critics of the poll say many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi appealed to his supporters to reject violence mousavi also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign used to reach young , urban voters .
ahmadinejad defended his victory at a mass rally in tehran on sunday , saying the election was fair .
" some inside or outside iran have come out and said the elections have been distorted .
where is the distortion in the election ? "
" their -lrb- western -rrb- standpoint is if the candidate they propagated does not win , then there has definitely been cheating , " he said .
post-election violence protests against ahmadinejad 's landslide election victory turned violent on saturday as supporters of reformist presidential candidate , mir hossein mousavi , clashed with police in the iranian capital in the worst scenes of violence since the 1979 islamic revolution .
riot police patrolled the streets of tehran as thousands of opposition supporters took part in demonstrations in iran 's capital , defying police warnings .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 62.6 percent of votes against 33.7 percent for mousavi in a record 85 percent turnout .

but state aid is linked to democratic progress , she says . zimbabwean prime minister , morgan tsvangirai , has been assured of the german government ‘ s full support for his pro-democracy course .
following talks in berlin on monday , june 15 , german chancellor angela merkel said zimbabwe would receive assistance to improve its education and health systems .
however , for the time being , no direct development aid will be given to the power-sharing government led by morgan tsvangirai .
" the democratic process in zimbabwe must become stronger , " mrs merkel said , and added that direct state aid would be linked to specific conditions .
" these include a constitutional process , a land reform that revises the expropriation of farms , as well as the establishment of a functioning state administration , " she elaborated .
rallying western support morgan tsvangirai ’ s visit to berlin is part of a three-week tour of europe and the united states designed to rally political and financial support from western governments .
the zimbabwean prime minister has so far succeeded in gaining modest commitments from several countries to increase humanitarian aid channeled through non-governmental organisations .
last friday us president barack obama pledged 73 million us dollars -lrb- 53 million euros -rrb- , after britain had already promised 24 million us dollars , and norway and the netherlands smaller amounts .
morgan tvangirai said the zimbabwean unity government had made " real progress in stabilising runaway inflation and in trying to create the conditions for democracy . "
zimbabwe ’ s pm also expressed the hope that international donors would move from strictly humanitarian assistance to aid designed to spur economic recovery .
" we hope to get not only humanitarian support , but also transitional support so that we can consolidate that process and ensure that zimbabweans do n't go back to an atmosphere of fear , " he said .
sanctions to remain however , with zimbabwean hardline president robert mugabe still in control of the country ’ s security forces , western governments have made it clear they are unwilling to grant direct aid to the government until major political and economic reforms are implemented .
chancellor merkel did n't say whether the sanctions imposed on zimbabwe by the european union in response to mugabe ’ s human rights abuses would be lifted soon .
the sanctions include the denial of visas and an arms embargo , as well as a freeze on western-based assets of robert mugabe and his associates .
the measures were tightened in the wake of a campaign of violence and intimidation waged by mugabe ’ s zanu-pf militias and zimbabwean police against morgan tsvangirai ’ s movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- .

in spite of massive state repression against the mdc and other pro-democracy groups in zimbabwe , mugabe ’ s zanu-pf lost its majority in parliament during elections in early 2008 .
as a result , mugabe was forced to agree to a power-sharing deal with morgan tsvangirai last september .
tsvangirai was sworn in as prime minister in february , 2009 .
but his relationship with president mugabe has been difficult .
tsvangirai has repeatedly said he needs to be able to show tangible results for his efforts in order to bolster his government 's standing among an impoverished population .
under the mugabe regime zimbabweans ‘ per capita income has fallen 10-fold in the past decade and the country is suffering an unemployment rate of more than 80 percent .

but state aid is linked to democratic progress , she says . zimbabwean prime minister , morgan tsvangirai , has been assured of the german government ‘ s full support for his pro-democracy course .
following talks in berlin on monday , june 15 , german chancellor angela merkel said zimbabwe would receive assistance to improve its education and health systems .
however , for the time being , no direct development aid will be given to the power-sharing government led by morgan tsvangirai .
" the democratic process in zimbabwe must become stronger , " mrs merkel said , and added that direct state aid would be linked to specific conditions .
" these include a constitutional process , a land reform that revises the expropriation of farms , as well as the establishment of a functioning state administration , " she elaborated .
rallying western support morgan tsvangirai ’ s visit to berlin is part of a three-week tour of europe and the united states designed to rally political and financial support from western governments .
the zimbabwean prime minister has so far succeeded in gaining modest commitments from several countries to increase humanitarian aid channeled through non-governmental organisations .
last friday us president barack obama pledged 73 million us dollars -lrb- 53 million euros -rrb- , after britain had already promised 24 million us dollars , and norway and the netherlands smaller amounts .
morgan tvangirai said the zimbabwean unity government had made " real progress in stabilising runaway inflation and in trying to create the conditions for democracy . "
zimbabwe ’ s pm also expressed the hope that international donors would move from strictly humanitarian assistance to aid designed to spur economic recovery .
" we hope to get not only humanitarian support , but also transitional support so that we can consolidate that process and ensure that zimbabweans do n't go back to an atmosphere of fear , " he said .
sanctions to remain however , with zimbabwean hardline president robert mugabe still in control of the country ’ s security forces , western governments have made it clear they are unwilling to grant direct aid to the government until major political and economic reforms are implemented .
chancellor merkel did n't say whether the sanctions imposed on zimbabwe by the european union in response to mugabe ’ s human rights abuses would be lifted soon .
the sanctions include the denial of visas and an arms embargo , as well as a freeze on western-based assets of robert mugabe and his associates .
the measures were tightened in the wake of a campaign of violence and intimidation waged by mugabe ’ s zanu-pf militias and zimbabwean police against morgan tsvangirai ’ s movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- .

a two-day eu conference in berlin will discuss methods to monitor migratory trends within europe . for decades the nations of the expanded european union , now comprising 27 countries , have wrangled over the integration of the eu ’ s 30 million foreign residents .
the question : how to deal with those who try to enter what human rights advocates call fortress europe ? at the berlin conference the catchwords will be “ monitoring ” and “ benchmarking , ” in other words , how to measure the success or failure of efforts to integrate so-called “ legal migrants ” across europe . residents with foreign passports make up about five percent of the eu ’ s total population of nearly 500 million .
luxembourg excels , with 38 percent of its population listed as foreigners .
germany is in mid-field at 8.9 percent or about seven-million foreign residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration policies diverge widely within the eu the german federal statistics office pointed out recently , however , that the underlying trend is far greater .
it counted those with “ migratory backgrounds , ” including persons who have adopted german citizenship and children raised in families with origins abroad .
the count soared to 15 million , or more than 18 percent of germany ’ s total population of 82 million . since the 1980s , go-it-alone policies pursued by individual nations have been superseded by an eu commission drive to coordinate a patchwork of policies on asylum and integration under a so-called global approach to migration .
adopted in 2007 , its measures range from promoting language acquisition and job skills among newcomers , to worker mobility within the eu ’ s visa-free internal borders , to frontex , the eu agency which patrols waters off northern africa . frontex often draws criticism from non-governmental organizations .
scenes of would-be migrants struggling ashore from sunken boats and recovered bodies prompted eu commission president jose manuel borroso last week to call for a summit of eu mediterranean states . aging eu will need younger workers the head of the eu ’ s social and economic committee mario sepi concedes that the demographics of an ageing eu population have also prompted europe ’ s nations to boost their efforts to successfully integrate foreigners .
by 2050 a third of the eu ’ s population will be 65 years or older , requiring many younger skilled workers including foreigners , and as taxpayers , to fill the gap . “ the european model of integration is a very broad model , " sepi said .
" and , if we ’ re unable to integrate new citizens into the eu , then we wouldn ’ t be true to what our message to the world is : integration at -lrb- the -rrb- national , social and economic levels . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister schaeuble puts the onus on immigrants ahead of the eu ’ s berlin conference , chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble , of her conservative christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , praised the integrative efforts of more than two million so-called russian-germans who have resettled in germany since the collapse of the former soviet union . schaeuble also insisted that potential immigrants had to make the first steps . “ if you know nothing about where you live or where you ’ re going to and if you don ’ t have a basic knowledge of the language , then you ’ ll have only a small chance of making it in the new country . ” do n't exclude skilled migrants but associations representing foreigners in germany and the dgb trade union federation have advocated an alternative migration concept for 2009 , germany ’ s super election year .
one group , pro-asylum , says recruitment of skilled migrants should not lead to situations where refugees find it increasingly difficult to obtain asylum in the european union . experts , including staff at the sinus social research institute in heidelberg , say the migratory policies and trends across the eu ’ s 27 nations are very diverse .
even the terminology “ migrant ” and “ foreigner ” are interpreted differently from country-to-country . in a recent study , sinus researchers carsten wippermann and berthold bodo flaig dismissed negative cliches of supposedly uneducated gastarbeiter or " guest workers " recruited by germany in the 1960s , mostly from turkey . german integration three decades of research had instead shown that many migrants in germany are educationally and vocationally advanced , with a strong work ethic and modern attitudes , they said . " among a broad cross-section of the migrant population there is a high degree of cultural adaption and willingness to integrate .
many have a bicultural self-definition .
that means , they don ’ t even regard themselves as ' migrants ' but as an obvious part of german society , " the researchers said . those results are reflected in a new study by germany ’ s allensbach research institute .

she is charged with contempt of court over the publication of classified information . florence hartmann , who was spokeswoman for the former chief war crimes prosecutor , carla del ponte , between 2000 and 2006 , is accused of having disclosed confidential information about the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in a book and an article published after she left her post .
the publications allegedly cite confidential documents and court decisions made during the trial of former serbian leader , slobodan milosevic , which implicate the serbian state in the 1995 massacre of thousands of men and boys in the bosnian town of srebrenica .
in his opening speech , icty prosecutor bruce macfarlane said he would show that the accused had consciously published information from classified documents .
but hartmann 's lawyer , guenael mettraux , says she did no wrong as the information referred to in her article and her book , entitled “ peace and punishment : the secret wars of politics and international justice ” was already in the public domain when her work went into print . online support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte with florence hartmann the journalist 's supporters , many journalists themselves , are running an internet petition which calls for the case to be dropped .

verheugen said the plan must offer a genuine long-term perspective . verheugen told german newspaper die welt that the eu commission would not allow the bailout of opel to pass automatically .
he said those who benefit most from the current plan were the russian investors .
approval by the eu commission would depend on the deal " offering assurances that opel will survive and will be competitive for a length of time , " verheugen said .
austro-canadian company magna had initiated the take-over but teamed up with russian state bank sberbank and car maker gaz to ensure financing the deal .
the russian side is set to take a 35 percent stake in opel and verheugen warned that any key decisions would then need approval from moscow .
russians seeking access to technology ?
he said the only ones who incured a relatively low risk by participating in general motors europe were the russian investors .
verheugen raised concern that they might use opel to gain access to modern technology to bring their domestic car production up to international standards .
russian car companies might then in turn try to boost exports of their own models , rather than continuing their commitment to opel .
" the fact that so far no investor in the world has come forward to continue the activities of gm europe without public aid , shows that the risk for the business is very high , " verheugen added. ai / welt / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the interior ministry and ahmadinejad have dismissed the criticism .
authorities ban opposition rally earlier on monday , the country 's interior ministry banned an opposition rally planned for later that day .
" some seditious elements had planned to hold a rally and by fabrication said they had permission from the interior ministry .
any disrupter of public security would be dealt with according to the law , " a state radio announcement said .
in a statement , mousavi condemned the ban , calling it an illegal act by the ministry .
however , he called on his supporters not to stage any rally without permission in order to avoid " violence by violence-mongers , " according to dpa news service .
hundreds of thousands of pro-mousavi demonstrators took to the streets of tehran nonetheless .
iranian state television said on tuesday seven people had been killed near the site of a rally in tehran .
the reports mark an escalation of violence after thousands of demonstrators clashed with police in tehran on saturday and sunday .
at least 60 protesters were arrested .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has criticized tehran over the election .
he also condemned what he called " brutal actions " against demonstrators .
berlin summons ambassador earlier on monday , the german government summoned iran 's ambassador to express concern over iranian authorities ' violent response to demonstrations .
deputy foreign minister reinhard silberberg told the ambassador that berlin considers the attempts to prevent peaceful demonstrations " unacceptable . "
silberberg also demanded international media be allowed to report freely and reporters ' security be guaranteed. ai / sje / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are often the first ones to lose their jobs , face pay cuts and harder working conditions .
still , even the current crisis wo n't stop the trend toward migration . as the economic malaise deepens and shows no clear signs of abating anytime soon , many countries around the world are turning up the pressure on migrants in an effort to ease the strain on the local labor market .
japan , a nation with few migrant laborers to begin with , introduced a program that offers latin american guest workers of japanese ancestry cash incentives if they leave the country .
in europe , spain and the czech republic are also trying to persuade workers from outside the european union to go back home by paying them money to do so .
while japan 's program bars workers who participate from returning to the country , spain 's program allows migrants to come back after three years under the condition that they have a specific work contract . it 's a natural impulse that countries are looking at curbing the number of migrant workers in times of economic turmoil , says dietrich thraenhardt , a leading migration expert who is currently a fellow at the transatlantic academy in washington .
he clearly favors the spanish incentive model for migrants .
" i think it makes sense as long as migrants are free to chose .
some migrants may want to return home and if you take for instance the funding from spain back to romania you can live better there .
but other migrants will want to stay and as long as they can chose i think it 's a good policy , " he says .
but as jemini pandya , spokeswoman for the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in geneva points out , the response to the spanish initiative has n't been dramatic .
most migrants think twice before they leave the country to which they came - often enduring considerable hardships on the way .
they know that once they go back to their home country , it will be hard to return again .
difficult data to ascertain in concrete terms how migrants are affected by the economic crisis is not easy .
many countries simply do n't have the tools to accurately document the flows of migrant workers and their financial situation in real-time , says pandya .
often it can take years until reliable data is gathered .
one of the best documented , current and most vivid examples showing how migrants are affected directly by the economic meltdown comes out of mexico .
according to the country 's central bank , the amount of money sent home by mexicans working abroad dropped by 19 percent in april of this year compared to the same month the previous year .
it was the steepest decline of so called remittances on record .
for mexico , which ranks third among countries receiving the highest remittances , the loss in revenue from abroad is significant .
the money sent home from mexicans working predominently in the united states amounted to roughly 25 billion dollars last year .
it is the country 's second largest source of income after oil exports . some experts deduct a historic reversal of the global migration trend from those numbers as well as from figures suggesting a drop in migration to the us and other countries and an increase in migrants leaving the us and other migration destinations .
however , the iom is more cautious .
spokeswoman jemini pandya argues that just because remittances are falling , it does n't necessarily mean that migrants have left the country , instead many may be simply sending less money home and trying to weather the crisis .
what 's more , says pandya , many people who are going back are planning to do so only for up to six months .
trend continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish migrant workers left britain to head home according to the iom there is no reversal of the global migration pattern .
instead , argues pandya , each country and region must be analysed individually .
in many cases , the economic crisis is n't the sole reason why migrants go back home .
" for example polish migrant workers to the uk and ireland have been returning to poland in large numbers , even actually before the financial crisis started , because the british economy had been deteriorating and the polish economy was stronger at the time and so they had already started to go back , " she says .
the same is true for brasilians leaving europe and for workers in the gulf states returning to india , pakistan and bangladesh , adds pandya .
even with the economic crisis , the iom does n't expect the total number of global migrants to drop and estimates that there will be between 210 and 214 million migrants by the end of next year .
dietrich thraenhardt also does n't predict a reversal of the long term trend toward migration , but notes that people might be inclined to be less mobile during the economic crisis .
" when the economy gets better again the migration will resume , because the structural imbalances between the poor southern world and the rich northern world with its problematic demography are still there and so the rich world needs labor from the poor world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trend toward international migration continues despite the crisis and when that happens , countries like britain , australia or malaysia , which have now scaled back the number of skilled and unskilled workers they let in , will have to ease their restrictions again .
because ultimately the fundamental labor shortages in these and many other countries can not be filled by domestic workers - even during an economic crisis , says jemini pandya : " migration never stops . "

they are often the first ones to lose their jobs , face pay cuts and harder working conditions .
still , even the current crisis wo n't stop the trend toward migration . as the economic malaise deepens and shows no clear signs of abating anytime soon , many countries around the world are turning up the pressure on migrants in an effort to ease the strain on the local labor market .
japan , a nation with few migrant laborers to begin with , introduced a program that offers latin american guest workers of japanese ancestry cash incentives if they leave the country .
in europe , spain and the czech republic are also trying to persuade workers from outside the european union to go back home by paying them money to do so .
while japan 's program bars workers who participate from returning to the country , spain 's program allows migrants to come back after three years under the condition that they have a specific work contract . it 's a natural impulse that countries are looking at curbing the number of migrant workers in times of economic turmoil , says dietrich thraenhardt , a leading migration expert who is currently a fellow at the transatlantic academy in washington .
he clearly favors the spanish incentive model for migrants .
" i think it makes sense as long as migrants are free to chose .
some migrants may want to return home and if you take for instance the funding from spain back to romania you can live better there .
but other migrants will want to stay and as long as they can chose i think it 's a good policy , " he says .
but as jemini pandya , spokeswoman for the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in geneva points out , the response to the spanish initiative has n't been dramatic .
most migrants think twice before they leave the country to which they came - often enduring considerable hardships on the way .
they know that once they go back to their home country , it will be hard to return again .
difficult data to ascertain in concrete terms how migrants are affected by the economic crisis is not easy .
many countries simply do n't have the tools to accurately document the flows of migrant workers and their financial situation in real-time , says pandya .
often it can take years until reliable data is gathered .
one of the best documented , current and most vivid examples showing how migrants are affected directly by the economic meltdown comes out of mexico .
according to the country 's central bank , the amount of money sent home by mexicans working abroad dropped by 19 percent in april of this year compared to the same month the previous year .
it was the steepest decline of so called remittances on record .
for mexico , which ranks third among countries receiving the highest remittances , the loss in revenue from abroad is significant .
the money sent home from mexicans working predominently in the united states amounted to roughly 25 billion dollars last year .
it is the country 's second largest source of income after oil exports . some experts deduct a historic reversal of the global migration trend from those numbers as well as from figures suggesting a drop in migration to the us and other countries and an increase in migrants leaving the us and other migration destinations .
however , the iom is more cautious .
spokeswoman jemini pandya argues that just because remittances are falling , it does n't necessarily mean that migrants have left the country , instead many may be simply sending less money home and trying to weather the crisis .
what 's more , says pandya , many people who are going back are planning to do so only for up to six months .
trend continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish migrant workers left britain to head home according to the iom there is no reversal of the global migration pattern .
instead , argues pandya , each country and region must be analysed individually .
in many cases , the economic crisis is n't the sole reason why migrants go back home .
" for example polish migrant workers to the uk and ireland have been returning to poland in large numbers , even actually before the financial crisis started , because the british economy had been deteriorating and the polish economy was stronger at the time and so they had already started to go back , " she says .

a two-day eu conference in berlin will discuss methods to monitor migratory trends within europe . for decades the nations of the expanded european union , now comprising 27 countries , have wrangled over the integration of the eu ’ s 30 million foreign residents .
the question : how to deal with those who try to enter what human rights advocates call fortress europe ? at the berlin conference the catchwords will be “ monitoring ” and “ benchmarking , ” in other words , how to measure the success or failure of efforts to integrate so-called “ legal migrants ” across europe . residents with foreign passports make up about five percent of the eu ’ s total population of nearly 500 million .
luxembourg excels , with 38 percent of its population listed as foreigners .
germany is in mid-field at 8.9 percent or about seven-million foreign residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration policies diverge widely within the eu the german federal statistics office pointed out recently , however , that the underlying trend is far greater .

the count soared to 15 million , or more than 18 percent of germany ’ s total population of 82 million . since the 1980s , go-it-alone policies pursued by individual nations have been superseded by an eu commission drive to coordinate a patchwork of policies on asylum and integration under a so-called global approach to migration .
adopted in 2007 , its measures range from promoting language acquisition and job skills among newcomers , to worker mobility within the eu ’ s visa-free internal borders , to frontex , the eu agency which patrols waters off northern africa . frontex often draws criticism from non-governmental organizations .
scenes of would-be migrants struggling ashore from sunken boats and recovered bodies prompted eu commission president jose manuel borroso last week to call for a summit of eu mediterranean states . aging eu will need younger workers the head of the eu ’ s social and economic committee mario sepi concedes that the demographics of an ageing eu population have also prompted europe ’ s nations to boost their efforts to successfully integrate foreigners .
by 2050 a third of the eu ’ s population will be 65 years or older , requiring many younger skilled workers including foreigners , and as taxpayers , to fill the gap . “ the european model of integration is a very broad model , " sepi said .
" and , if we ’ re unable to integrate new citizens into the eu , then we wouldn ’ t be true to what our message to the world is : integration at -lrb- the -rrb- national , social and economic levels . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister schaeuble puts the onus on immigrants ahead of the eu ’ s berlin conference , chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble , of her conservative christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , praised the integrative efforts of more than two million so-called russian-germans who have resettled in germany since the collapse of the former soviet union . schaeuble also insisted that potential immigrants had to make the first steps . “ if you know nothing about where you live or where you ’ re going to and if you don ’ t have a basic knowledge of the language , then you ’ ll have only a small chance of making it in the new country . ” do n't exclude skilled migrants but associations representing foreigners in germany and the dgb trade union federation have advocated an alternative migration concept for 2009 , germany ’ s super election year .

even the terminology “ migrant ” and “ foreigner ” are interpreted differently from country-to-country . in a recent study , sinus researchers carsten wippermann and berthold bodo flaig dismissed negative cliches of supposedly uneducated gastarbeiter or " guest workers " recruited by germany in the 1960s , mostly from turkey . german integration three decades of research had instead shown that many migrants in germany are educationally and vocationally advanced , with a strong work ethic and modern attitudes , they said .

a two-day eu conference in berlin will discuss methods to monitor migratory trends within europe . for decades the nations of the expanded european union , now comprising 27 countries , have wrangled over the integration of the eu ’ s 30 million foreign residents .
the question : how to deal with those who try to enter what human rights advocates call fortress europe ? at the berlin conference the catchwords will be “ monitoring ” and “ benchmarking , ” in other words , how to measure the success or failure of efforts to integrate so-called “ legal migrants ” across europe . residents with foreign passports make up about five percent of the eu ’ s total population of nearly 500 million .
luxembourg excels , with 38 percent of its population listed as foreigners .
germany is in mid-field at 8.9 percent or about seven-million foreign residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration policies diverge widely within the eu the german federal statistics office pointed out recently , however , that the underlying trend is far greater .
it counted those with “ migratory backgrounds , ” including persons who have adopted german citizenship and children raised in families with origins abroad .
the count soared to 15 million , or more than 18 percent of germany ’ s total population of 82 million . since the 1980s , go-it-alone policies pursued by individual nations have been superseded by an eu commission drive to coordinate a patchwork of policies on asylum and integration under a so-called global approach to migration .
adopted in 2007 , its measures range from promoting language acquisition and job skills among newcomers , to worker mobility within the eu ’ s visa-free internal borders , to frontex , the eu agency which patrols waters off northern africa . frontex often draws criticism from non-governmental organizations .
scenes of would-be migrants struggling ashore from sunken boats and recovered bodies prompted eu commission president jose manuel borroso last week to call for a summit of eu mediterranean states . aging eu will need younger workers the head of the eu ’ s social and economic committee mario sepi concedes that the demographics of an ageing eu population have also prompted europe ’ s nations to boost their efforts to successfully integrate foreigners .
by 2050 a third of the eu ’ s population will be 65 years or older , requiring many younger skilled workers including foreigners , and as taxpayers , to fill the gap . “ the european model of integration is a very broad model , " sepi said .

" we are looking towards tehran with great concern at the moment .
there are a lot of reports of electoral fraud . " said steinmeier in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster , ard . eu officials also expresssed their reservations about the results of the polling in tehran .

the journalist told the bayrischer rundfunk television network that the situation had escalated after ahmadinejad accused foreign press of blowing the demonstrations out of proportion .
metzger said militiamen had taken the president 's words as a call to action and had clamped down on international media as a result .
he said a group of six men had appeared in the ard office in tehran armed with truncheons and electronic shock devices , and had taken one of his colleagues with them .

while opposition supporters protest the election results that put president mahmoud ahmadinejad back in office , international news organizations say they are being prevented from reporting on the escalating events . german public broadcasters zdf and ard say their journalists are being prevented from doing their jobs , with the zdf team barred from reporting and ard correspondent peter mezger no longer allowed to leave his hotel .
the journalist told the bayrischer rundfunk television network that the situation had escalated after ahmadinejad accused foreign press of blowing the demonstrations out of proportion .
metzger said militiamen had taken the president 's words as a call to action and had clamped down on international media as a result .
he said a group of six men had appeared in the ard office in tehran armed with truncheons and electronic shock devices , and had taken one of his colleagues with them .
his whereabouts is still unkown .
in a letter to the iranian ambassador in berlin , the editors-in-chief of the two stations , said : “ we see a breach of freedom of the press and democratic principles . ”
they insisted , however , that they would continue to report in a “ critical , fair and independent ” manner .
electronic jamming the bbc has also reported difficulties .
it says the satellites it uses for its persian radio and television services have been affected by “ heavy electronic jamming ” which was becoming “ progressively worse . ”

he added that it appeared to be “ part of a pattern of behavior by the iranian authorities to limit the reporting of the aftermath of the disputed election . ”
the ap news agency said it had been told by government representatives not to deliver any footage to the bbc persian service , which is very popular in iran , or to voice of america .
whatever it takes a dutch television crew for public broadcaster nederland 2 said one of its journalists and cameramen had been arrested while filming outside the headquarters of ahmadinejad 's closest challenger , mir hossein mousavi .
“ they were pushed against a wall and their tapes were seized .
their filming permits were withdrawn and they had to leave the country immediately , ” nederland 2 said in a statement .
the arab news station al-arabiya was shut down for a week , while a spanish journalist also reported the confiscation of footage of some of the post-election protests .
press inside iran has shown very little sign of the ongoing unrest and an editor of the pro-mousavi newspaper kalemeh sabs said the authorities had forbidden the distribution of the paper on sunday .

verheugen said the plan must offer a genuine long-term perspective . verheugen told german newspaper die welt that the eu commission would not allow the bailout of opel to pass automatically .
he said those who benefit most from the current plan were the russian investors .
approval by the eu commission would depend on the deal " offering assurances that opel will survive and will be competitive for a length of time , " verheugen said .
austro-canadian company magna had initiated the take-over but teamed up with russian state bank sberbank and car maker gaz to ensure financing the deal .
the russian side is set to take a 35 percent stake in opel and verheugen warned that any key decisions would then need approval from moscow .
russians seeking access to technology ?
he said the only ones who incured a relatively low risk by participating in general motors europe were the russian investors .
verheugen raised concern that they might use opel to gain access to modern technology to bring their domestic car production up to international standards .
russian car companies might then in turn try to boost exports of their own models , rather than continuing their commitment to opel .
" the fact that so far no investor in the world has come forward to continue the activities of gm europe without public aid , shows that the risk for the business is very high , " verheugen added. ai / welt / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the democratic process in zimbabwe must become stronger , " mrs merkel said , and added that direct state aid would be linked to specific conditions .
" these include a constitutional process , a land reform that revises the expropriation of farms , as well as the establishment of a functioning state administration , " she elaborated .

the sanctions include the denial of visas and an arms embargo , as well as a freeze on western-based assets of robert mugabe and his associates .

but state aid is linked to democratic progress , she says . zimbabwean prime minister , morgan tsvangirai , has been assured of the german government ‘ s full support for his pro-democracy course .
following talks in berlin on monday , june 15 , german chancellor angela merkel said zimbabwe would receive assistance to improve its education and health systems .
however , for the time being , no direct development aid will be given to the power-sharing government led by morgan tsvangirai .
" the democratic process in zimbabwe must become stronger , " mrs merkel said , and added that direct state aid would be linked to specific conditions .
" these include a constitutional process , a land reform that revises the expropriation of farms , as well as the establishment of a functioning state administration , " she elaborated .
rallying western support morgan tsvangirai ’ s visit to berlin is part of a three-week tour of europe and the united states designed to rally political and financial support from western governments .
the zimbabwean prime minister has so far succeeded in gaining modest commitments from several countries to increase humanitarian aid channeled through non-governmental organisations .
last friday us president barack obama pledged 73 million us dollars -lrb- 53 million euros -rrb- , after britain had already promised 24 million us dollars , and norway and the netherlands smaller amounts .
morgan tvangirai said the zimbabwean unity government had made " real progress in stabilising runaway inflation and in trying to create the conditions for democracy . "
zimbabwe ’ s pm also expressed the hope that international donors would move from strictly humanitarian assistance to aid designed to spur economic recovery .
" we hope to get not only humanitarian support , but also transitional support so that we can consolidate that process and ensure that zimbabweans do n't go back to an atmosphere of fear , " he said .
sanctions to remain however , with zimbabwean hardline president robert mugabe still in control of the country ’ s security forces , western governments have made it clear they are unwilling to grant direct aid to the government until major political and economic reforms are implemented .
chancellor merkel did n't say whether the sanctions imposed on zimbabwe by the european union in response to mugabe ’ s human rights abuses would be lifted soon .
the sanctions include the denial of visas and an arms embargo , as well as a freeze on western-based assets of robert mugabe and his associates .
the measures were tightened in the wake of a campaign of violence and intimidation waged by mugabe ’ s zanu-pf militias and zimbabwean police against morgan tsvangirai ’ s movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- .
fragile government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morgan tsvangirai , left , was sworn in as prime minister by his rival , president robert mugabe , in february , 2009 .
in spite of massive state repression against the mdc and other pro-democracy groups in zimbabwe , mugabe ’ s zanu-pf lost its majority in parliament during elections in early 2008 .
as a result , mugabe was forced to agree to a power-sharing deal with morgan tsvangirai last september .
tsvangirai was sworn in as prime minister in february , 2009 .
but his relationship with president mugabe has been difficult .
tsvangirai has repeatedly said he needs to be able to show tangible results for his efforts in order to bolster his government 's standing among an impoverished population .
under the mugabe regime zimbabweans ‘ per capita income has fallen 10-fold in the past decade and the country is suffering an unemployment rate of more than 80 percent .

proponents of the online survey hail it as a useful tool for patients , but doctors are firmly against it . the german association of health insurers -lrb- aok -rrb- has announced that insured patients , numbering around 24 million , will be able to grade their doctors ' performance and services in an online questionnaire starting next year .
online surveys already exist for a number of professions and industries in germany , including university professors , car-dealers , and nursing home staff , but a proposal to introduce a similar assessment tool for the medical community has caused a stir among doctors .
they fear that the design of the online survey would be overly simplistic , and could lead patients to judge doctors only on their test results , rather than on the actual quality of the treatment and care they provide .
insurance spokesperson susanne ruesberg-uhrig acknowledges the demand for a rating system for doctors , but insists that the project will only make sense if doctors and scientists can develop a " criteria catalog . "
the president of the german medical association , joerg-dietrich hoppe , is also critical , saying that it is not legitimate " to use an anonymous questionnaire as a basis for rankings . "

the exhibition brings together leading aviation experts and business leaders from around the world .
but the mood of the air show is far from festive . the paris air show is held every two years at the le bourget airport just outside paris and is traditionally a place where contracts with airline manufacturers are inked .
but deals like the one announced monday by qatar airways for 24 airbus a320 jets are likely to be the exception at this year 's paris air show in light of the global economic recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar airways has ordered 24 airbus a320 aircraft european aircraft manufacturer airbus and american aviation company boeing are among the companies hardest hit by the global recession .
even if new orders come in , they wo n't necessarily mean a light at the end of the tunnel for either company .
many new purchases are offset by cancellations of previous deals made during the peak of an aviation industry boom , which occurred around the last paris air show two years ago .
delivery delays additionally , both companies are struggling to deliver on the large backlog of orders they still have .
the airbus a400m military transporter , which was originally scheduled for delivery at the beginning of this year , has seen major delays .
the future of the 20-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- project is at risk as some clients have threatened to cancel their orders .
boeing 's 787 dreamliner , a fuel-efficient , long-haul aircraft , has also seen its share of delays .
speculation that the dreamliner would make its first test flight at the paris air show has been put to rest by boeing representatives attending the event , who say the test flight is scheduled for the end of the month .
future of aviation industry unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 787 ' dreamliner ' was unveiled in july 2007 , but is yet to be tested in the air statements from boeing and airbus executives reflect mixed expectations when it comes to the future of the airline industry .
scott carson , head of boeing 's commercial airplanes division , said he remained optimistic that the industry would bounce back by mid-2010 . airbus chief executive tom enders did n't go so far as to say he expected a turnaround inext year , but said that 2010 and 2011 would be critical years for the aviation sector .
on top of the grim financial future of the airline industry , many questions still surround the recent crash of an air france a330 airbus in the atlantic that claimed the lives of all 228 people on board .
the plane was scheduled to land in paris after taking off from rio de janeiro on june 1 .
despite that tragedy , and the dark clouds over the future of the airline industry , attendance at the paris air show does not appear to have suffered since 2007 .
around 2,000 exhibitors from over 40 countries are in attendance , and event organizers expect about 300,000 visitors throughout the week-long exhibition. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a joint statement , eu ministers agreed that " piracy off the coast of somalia is likely to remain a serious threat . "
the extension was made now because " early agreement on extending the operation would facilitate the necessary force generation . "
international navies have deployed dozens of warships around the gulf of aden over the past year in a attempt to curb attacks by pirates threatening the busy maritime trade route .
operation atalanta currently consists of 14 ships and three aircraft .
the german contribution consists of a total of 650 personnel , two warships , one supply ship and one reconnaissance plane .
the german frigate brandenburg left the port of wilhelmshaven on monday to relieve one of the vessels already in the gulf of aden .
the parliamentary mandate for german forces deployed on the mission expires at the end of 2009 .
it is not yet clear whether that mandate will be extended to allow for further involvement now that atalanta has been prolonged .
the eu mission , which draws on forces from germany , belgium , britain , france , italy , greece , the netherlands , spain and sweden , has been operational since december 2008 .
naval officers at the mission 's headquarters in northwood , london , say atalanta forces have arrested about 70 pirates so far .
they have also escorted 28 ships chartered by the world food program on aid delivery missions throughout the region. sje / ap / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a joint statement , eu ministers agreed that " piracy off the coast of somalia is likely to remain a serious threat . "
the extension was made now because " early agreement on extending the operation would facilitate the necessary force generation . "
international navies have deployed dozens of warships around the gulf of aden over the past year in a attempt to curb attacks by pirates threatening the busy maritime trade route .
operation atalanta currently consists of 14 ships and three aircraft .
the german contribution consists of a total of 650 personnel , two warships , one supply ship and one reconnaissance plane .
the german frigate brandenburg left the port of wilhelmshaven on monday to relieve one of the vessels already in the gulf of aden .
the parliamentary mandate for german forces deployed on the mission expires at the end of 2009 .
it is not yet clear whether that mandate will be extended to allow for further involvement now that atalanta has been prolonged .
the eu mission , which draws on forces from germany , belgium , britain , france , italy , greece , the netherlands , spain and sweden , has been operational since december 2008 .
naval officers at the mission 's headquarters in northwood , london , say atalanta forces have arrested about 70 pirates so far .
they have also escorted 28 ships chartered by the world food program on aid delivery missions throughout the region. sje / ap / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" are we too dependent on exports ?
i believe there is no alternative to being a country with strong exports , " merkel told a conference hosted by germany 's main industry association , the bdi .
" otherwise we are putting our standard of living at risk , " she said .
merkel 's remarks came in response to warnings from economists that a slump in global trade meant that germany should take steps to boost domestic demand to offset falling foreign orders , and reduce the nation 's reliance on export markets .
germany is the world 's biggest exporter of goods , with particular strengths in the machinery , chemicals and auto sectors .
its manufacturers have been hit hard by a collapse in demand caused by the global financial crisis .
officials in berlin expect the german economy to shrink by around six percent this year , the second biggest slump among advanced economies after japan .
chancellor merkel told business delegates that the scale of the economic crisis meant world leaders must press on with the global market reforms the group of 20 leading industrial and emerging economies agreed to march this year . " we have to work further on the rules with a continuing effort , " she said .
election : what election ?
speakers at the conference in berlin included leading politicians – eager to highlight their political messages ahead of general elections in september .
chancellor angela merkel also used the conference to defend her policy of providing state aid for ailing companies . her conservative-led coalition government has faced mounting criticism for supporting general motors ' european unit opel , but turning down a bailout for the troubled german retail and tour group arcandor ag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bdi president keitel says german taxpayers should not pay for management failings opel , merkel said , was a special case , while insolvency would help lay the ground for restructuring arcandor , which operates germany 's karstadt department store chain . merkel said arcandor had been in trouble before the crisis hit germany last year , so it is not entitled to receive funds and loan guarantees .
arcandor filed for insolvency last week .
" i would n't have decided differently if germany had not been in an election campaign , " merkel told the bdi convention .
parliamentary elections are scheduled for september 27 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is merkel 's social democratic challenger for the chancellorship , said governments must be prepared to step in to help save jobs .
" to me , it concerns the future of this nation and the economy , " steinmeier told the industry delegates in berlin .
a highly risky strategy bdi president hans-peter keitel said he hoped that the government 's strategy in rescuing carmaker opel would remain an exception to the rule .
" the german taxpayer must not end up footing the bill for grave management blunders , " he said .
keitel also said the government 's economic policy should not be driven by populist efforts to win votes .
" by deciding to rescue opel , the government has displayed a kind of behaviour that it sometimes likes to accuse us business people of . "
this was a highly risky strategy that might cost the taxpayer dearly in the end , keitel added .
the bdi president also said there must be limits for industry demands for state assistance .
" we should not try to make it is easy for us by turning to the government in times of crisis , " he said. db / sje / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" are we too dependent on exports ?
i believe there is no alternative to being a country with strong exports , " merkel told a conference hosted by germany 's main industry association , the bdi .
" otherwise we are putting our standard of living at risk , " she said .
merkel 's remarks came in response to warnings from economists that a slump in global trade meant that germany should take steps to boost domestic demand to offset falling foreign orders , and reduce the nation 's reliance on export markets .
germany is the world 's biggest exporter of goods , with particular strengths in the machinery , chemicals and auto sectors .
its manufacturers have been hit hard by a collapse in demand caused by the global financial crisis .
officials in berlin expect the german economy to shrink by around six percent this year , the second biggest slump among advanced economies after japan .
chancellor merkel told business delegates that the scale of the economic crisis meant world leaders must press on with the global market reforms the group of 20 leading industrial and emerging economies agreed to march this year . " we have to work further on the rules with a continuing effort , " she said .
election : what election ?
speakers at the conference in berlin included leading politicians – eager to highlight their political messages ahead of general elections in september .
chancellor angela merkel also used the conference to defend her policy of providing state aid for ailing companies . her conservative-led coalition government has faced mounting criticism for supporting general motors ' european unit opel , but turning down a bailout for the troubled german retail and tour group arcandor ag .

arcandor filed for insolvency last week .
" i would n't have decided differently if germany had not been in an election campaign , " merkel told the bdi convention .
parliamentary elections are scheduled for september 27 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is merkel 's social democratic challenger for the chancellorship , said governments must be prepared to step in to help save jobs .
" to me , it concerns the future of this nation and the economy , " steinmeier told the industry delegates in berlin .
a highly risky strategy bdi president hans-peter keitel said he hoped that the government 's strategy in rescuing carmaker opel would remain an exception to the rule .
" the german taxpayer must not end up footing the bill for grave management blunders , " he said .
keitel also said the government 's economic policy should not be driven by populist efforts to win votes .
" by deciding to rescue opel , the government has displayed a kind of behaviour that it sometimes likes to accuse us business people of . "
this was a highly risky strategy that might cost the taxpayer dearly in the end , keitel added .
the bdi president also said there must be limits for industry demands for state assistance .

now she tells deutsche welle she hopes the protest movement against it succeeds - and stays peaceful . deutsche welle : what 's been your experience over the past few days ?
shahla lahiji : many , many people , not just young but middle aged and some old people , participated in the demonstrations , and last night -lrb- sunday -rrb- they attacked the campus of the students in the tehran university .
they beat them badly and took 400 students .
where they are now , we do n't know .
many within iran have said that this election stirred up more popular enthusiasm than others have . why is that ?
well , it 's the first time in our constitutional history that the wishes and hopes of the people came to something real from the candidates .
and that was one of the reasons that so many people participated .
before , many said that they would not participate in any kind of vote anymore .
this time they participated because they mentioned the freedoms that the people wanted .
and maybe it 's the reason that what happened when the results came out took place , because people knew that they were not honest and not correct , that something happened .
so it is your belief that the official result is false ?
it 's not my belief , it 's the belief of all the people who were in the streets being attacked by -lsb- basij -rsb- guards and police !
you have had a role in protest movements in the past … oh yes , i 'm one of the people who went to the berlin conference -lsb- “ iran after the elections ” -ed . -rsb- , and i went to prison for it , like mehrangiz kar or akbar ganji .
because i was against censorship .
if you go into the internet you will find a lot on my story , my life , my biography ...
yes , and the protest movement of that era , that of summer 1999 and thereafter , was eventually crushed by the government .
do you see parallels between then and now ?
yes , because what was being offered by the candidates could not be accepted by this regime .
they could not let them do this and want this , and they would not let the candidates talk like that and offer this to people .
so we knew that something would happen .
i could foresee this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi is becoming a folk hero are there parallels between what is happening now and the movement of 1978-9 .
a movement in which people are n't just criticizing one politician , or one action , they 're criticizing the whole system .
no , i am not saying that they wanted to overthrow the regime , they wanted very serious reform .
about personal freedom , human rights , and women 's rights .
they did n't like what was being done to women on the streets over the past four years by the -lsb- basij -rsb- guards , and they wanted normal contact with the world .
people may have been voting for reform of the system , but if this system has now failed them , if it has refused to listen to them , are they now going to go against the system itself ?
yes , that 's why there are so many protests !
where can this go then , if this is the people against the system ?
i do n't know , but i hope that they can continue with their demonstrations in a quiet and calm way and i hope that it does n't turn to violence because i know , if it does , it will be crushed down badly .
as they did last night in the university campus .
and now you know there is a demonstration going on that had not been allowed between two very important squares in tehran -lsb- revolution and freedom squares – ed . -rsb- and i am not participating because my legs have problems and i knew that i could not walk all that way.i hope it wo n't become violent , because i 'm sure that wo n't bring a good result .
do you think that will happen ?
well they do n't want to let the people do this .
and both sides have called this a coup d 'état – not just the protestors .
the government says it 's a “ color revolution , ” because mousavi 's supporters ' color is green , like the orange revolution in ukraine or the rose revolution in georgia and i do n't know where else .
do you expect … do you know my phone is under their control ?
you know i 'm taking a big risk to talk to you like this ... i think this is enough !
okay , then it 's enough !

now she tells deutsche welle she hopes the protest movement against it succeeds - and stays peaceful . deutsche welle : what 's been your experience over the past few days ?
shahla lahiji : many , many people , not just young but middle aged and some old people , participated in the demonstrations , and last night -lrb- sunday -rrb- they attacked the campus of the students in the tehran university .
they beat them badly and took 400 students .
where they are now , we do n't know .
many within iran have said that this election stirred up more popular enthusiasm than others have . why is that ?
well , it 's the first time in our constitutional history that the wishes and hopes of the people came to something real from the candidates .
and that was one of the reasons that so many people participated .
before , many said that they would not participate in any kind of vote anymore .
this time they participated because they mentioned the freedoms that the people wanted .
and maybe it 's the reason that what happened when the results came out took place , because people knew that they were not honest and not correct , that something happened .
so it is your belief that the official result is false ?
it 's not my belief , it 's the belief of all the people who were in the streets being attacked by -lsb- basij -rsb- guards and police !
you have had a role in protest movements in the past … oh yes , i 'm one of the people who went to the berlin conference -lsb- “ iran after the elections ” -ed . -rsb- , and i went to prison for it , like mehrangiz kar or akbar ganji .
because i was against censorship .
if you go into the internet you will find a lot on my story , my life , my biography ...
yes , and the protest movement of that era , that of summer 1999 and thereafter , was eventually crushed by the government .
do you see parallels between then and now ?
yes , because what was being offered by the candidates could not be accepted by this regime .
they could not let them do this and want this , and they would not let the candidates talk like that and offer this to people .
so we knew that something would happen .
i could foresee this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi is becoming a folk hero are there parallels between what is happening now and the movement of 1978-9 .
a movement in which people are n't just criticizing one politician , or one action , they 're criticizing the whole system .
no , i am not saying that they wanted to overthrow the regime , they wanted very serious reform .
about personal freedom , human rights , and women 's rights .
they did n't like what was being done to women on the streets over the past four years by the -lsb- basij -rsb- guards , and they wanted normal contact with the world .
people may have been voting for reform of the system , but if this system has now failed them , if it has refused to listen to them , are they now going to go against the system itself ?
yes , that 's why there are so many protests !
where can this go then , if this is the people against the system ?
i do n't know , but i hope that they can continue with their demonstrations in a quiet and calm way and i hope that it does n't turn to violence because i know , if it does , it will be crushed down badly .
as they did last night in the university campus .
and now you know there is a demonstration going on that had not been allowed between two very important squares in tehran -lsb- revolution and freedom squares – ed . -rsb- and i am not participating because my legs have problems and i knew that i could not walk all that way.i hope it wo n't become violent , because i 'm sure that wo n't bring a good result .
do you think that will happen ?
well they do n't want to let the people do this .
and both sides have called this a coup d 'état – not just the protestors .
the government says it 's a “ color revolution , ” because mousavi 's supporters ' color is green , like the orange revolution in ukraine or the rose revolution in georgia and i do n't know where else .
do you expect … do you know my phone is under their control ?
you know i 'm taking a big risk to talk to you like this ... i think this is enough !

" these people who call themselves the opposition are seeking neither electoral victory , nor victory for their principles and ideas - they are seeking chaos and destabilisation , " voronin said .
voronin , who has been in office since 2001 , is prohibited from running for a third term under moldova 's constitution .
fresh polls became necessary on june 3 , when 60 deputies voted in favour of greceanii 's candidacy , leaving the communists one vote short of the 60 % majority needed in the 101-seat chamber .

a two-day eu conference in berlin will discuss methods to monitor migratory trends within europe . for decades the nations of the expanded european union , now comprising 27 countries , have wrangled over the integration of the eu ’ s 30 million foreign residents .
the question : how to deal with those who try to enter what human rights advocates call fortress europe ? at the berlin conference the catchwords will be “ monitoring ” and “ benchmarking , ” in other words , how to measure the success or failure of efforts to integrate so-called “ legal migrants ” across europe . residents with foreign passports make up about five percent of the eu ’ s total population of nearly 500 million .
luxembourg excels , with 38 percent of its population listed as foreigners .
germany is in mid-field at 8.9 percent or about seven-million foreign residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration policies diverge widely within the eu the german federal statistics office pointed out recently , however , that the underlying trend is far greater .
it counted those with “ migratory backgrounds , ” including persons who have adopted german citizenship and children raised in families with origins abroad .
the count soared to 15 million , or more than 18 percent of germany ’ s total population of 82 million . since the 1980s , go-it-alone policies pursued by individual nations have been superseded by an eu commission drive to coordinate a patchwork of policies on asylum and integration under a so-called global approach to migration .
adopted in 2007 , its measures range from promoting language acquisition and job skills among newcomers , to worker mobility within the eu ’ s visa-free internal borders , to frontex , the eu agency which patrols waters off northern africa . frontex often draws criticism from non-governmental organizations .
scenes of would-be migrants struggling ashore from sunken boats and recovered bodies prompted eu commission president jose manuel borroso last week to call for a summit of eu mediterranean states . aging eu will need younger workers the head of the eu ’ s social and economic committee mario sepi concedes that the demographics of an ageing eu population have also prompted europe ’ s nations to boost their efforts to successfully integrate foreigners .
by 2050 a third of the eu ’ s population will be 65 years or older , requiring many younger skilled workers including foreigners , and as taxpayers , to fill the gap . “ the european model of integration is a very broad model , " sepi said .
" and , if we ’ re unable to integrate new citizens into the eu , then we wouldn ’ t be true to what our message to the world is : integration at -lrb- the -rrb- national , social and economic levels . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister schaeuble puts the onus on immigrants ahead of the eu ’ s berlin conference , chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble , of her conservative christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , praised the integrative efforts of more than two million so-called russian-germans who have resettled in germany since the collapse of the former soviet union . schaeuble also insisted that potential immigrants had to make the first steps . “ if you know nothing about where you live or where you ’ re going to and if you don ’ t have a basic knowledge of the language , then you ’ ll have only a small chance of making it in the new country . ” do n't exclude skilled migrants but associations representing foreigners in germany and the dgb trade union federation have advocated an alternative migration concept for 2009 , germany ’ s super election year .
one group , pro-asylum , says recruitment of skilled migrants should not lead to situations where refugees find it increasingly difficult to obtain asylum in the european union . experts , including staff at the sinus social research institute in heidelberg , say the migratory policies and trends across the eu ’ s 27 nations are very diverse .
even the terminology “ migrant ” and “ foreigner ” are interpreted differently from country-to-country . in a recent study , sinus researchers carsten wippermann and berthold bodo flaig dismissed negative cliches of supposedly uneducated gastarbeiter or " guest workers " recruited by germany in the 1960s , mostly from turkey . german integration three decades of research had instead shown that many migrants in germany are educationally and vocationally advanced , with a strong work ethic and modern attitudes , they said . " among a broad cross-section of the migrant population there is a high degree of cultural adaption and willingness to integrate .
many have a bicultural self-definition .
that means , they don ’ t even regard themselves as ' migrants ' but as an obvious part of german society , " the researchers said . those results are reflected in a new study by germany ’ s allensbach research institute .
it says 69 percent of migrants feel comfortable in germany ; and 58 percent regard themselves as part of german society .
amongst turkish migrants , however , a quarter said they still felt as if they were foreign or different . ipj / epd / kna / bpb / apuz / eurostats editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are often the first ones to lose their jobs , face pay cuts and harder working conditions .
still , even the current crisis wo n't stop the trend toward migration . as the economic malaise deepens and shows no clear signs of abating anytime soon , many countries around the world are turning up the pressure on migrants in an effort to ease the strain on the local labor market .
japan , a nation with few migrant laborers to begin with , introduced a program that offers latin american guest workers of japanese ancestry cash incentives if they leave the country .
in europe , spain and the czech republic are also trying to persuade workers from outside the european union to go back home by paying them money to do so .
while japan 's program bars workers who participate from returning to the country , spain 's program allows migrants to come back after three years under the condition that they have a specific work contract . it 's a natural impulse that countries are looking at curbing the number of migrant workers in times of economic turmoil , says dietrich thraenhardt , a leading migration expert who is currently a fellow at the transatlantic academy in washington .
he clearly favors the spanish incentive model for migrants .
" i think it makes sense as long as migrants are free to chose .
some migrants may want to return home and if you take for instance the funding from spain back to romania you can live better there .
but other migrants will want to stay and as long as they can chose i think it 's a good policy , " he says .
but as jemini pandya , spokeswoman for the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in geneva points out , the response to the spanish initiative has n't been dramatic .
most migrants think twice before they leave the country to which they came - often enduring considerable hardships on the way .
they know that once they go back to their home country , it will be hard to return again .
difficult data to ascertain in concrete terms how migrants are affected by the economic crisis is not easy .
many countries simply do n't have the tools to accurately document the flows of migrant workers and their financial situation in real-time , says pandya .
often it can take years until reliable data is gathered .
one of the best documented , current and most vivid examples showing how migrants are affected directly by the economic meltdown comes out of mexico .
according to the country 's central bank , the amount of money sent home by mexicans working abroad dropped by 19 percent in april of this year compared to the same month the previous year .
it was the steepest decline of so called remittances on record .
for mexico , which ranks third among countries receiving the highest remittances , the loss in revenue from abroad is significant .
the money sent home from mexicans working predominently in the united states amounted to roughly 25 billion dollars last year .
it is the country 's second largest source of income after oil exports . some experts deduct a historic reversal of the global migration trend from those numbers as well as from figures suggesting a drop in migration to the us and other countries and an increase in migrants leaving the us and other migration destinations .
however , the iom is more cautious .
spokeswoman jemini pandya argues that just because remittances are falling , it does n't necessarily mean that migrants have left the country , instead many may be simply sending less money home and trying to weather the crisis .
what 's more , says pandya , many people who are going back are planning to do so only for up to six months .
trend continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish migrant workers left britain to head home according to the iom there is no reversal of the global migration pattern .
instead , argues pandya , each country and region must be analysed individually .
in many cases , the economic crisis is n't the sole reason why migrants go back home .
" for example polish migrant workers to the uk and ireland have been returning to poland in large numbers , even actually before the financial crisis started , because the british economy had been deteriorating and the polish economy was stronger at the time and so they had already started to go back , " she says .
the same is true for brasilians leaving europe and for workers in the gulf states returning to india , pakistan and bangladesh , adds pandya .
even with the economic crisis , the iom does n't expect the total number of global migrants to drop and estimates that there will be between 210 and 214 million migrants by the end of next year .
dietrich thraenhardt also does n't predict a reversal of the long term trend toward migration , but notes that people might be inclined to be less mobile during the economic crisis .
" when the economy gets better again the migration will resume , because the structural imbalances between the poor southern world and the rich northern world with its problematic demography are still there and so the rich world needs labor from the poor world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trend toward international migration continues despite the crisis and when that happens , countries like britain , australia or malaysia , which have now scaled back the number of skilled and unskilled workers they let in , will have to ease their restrictions again .
because ultimately the fundamental labor shortages in these and many other countries can not be filled by domestic workers - even during an economic crisis , says jemini pandya : " migration never stops . "

they are often the first ones to lose their jobs , face pay cuts and harder working conditions .
still , even the current crisis wo n't stop the trend toward migration . as the economic malaise deepens and shows no clear signs of abating anytime soon , many countries around the world are turning up the pressure on migrants in an effort to ease the strain on the local labor market .
japan , a nation with few migrant laborers to begin with , introduced a program that offers latin american guest workers of japanese ancestry cash incentives if they leave the country .
in europe , spain and the czech republic are also trying to persuade workers from outside the european union to go back home by paying them money to do so .
while japan 's program bars workers who participate from returning to the country , spain 's program allows migrants to come back after three years under the condition that they have a specific work contract . it 's a natural impulse that countries are looking at curbing the number of migrant workers in times of economic turmoil , says dietrich thraenhardt , a leading migration expert who is currently a fellow at the transatlantic academy in washington .
he clearly favors the spanish incentive model for migrants .
" i think it makes sense as long as migrants are free to chose .
some migrants may want to return home and if you take for instance the funding from spain back to romania you can live better there .
but other migrants will want to stay and as long as they can chose i think it 's a good policy , " he says .
but as jemini pandya , spokeswoman for the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in geneva points out , the response to the spanish initiative has n't been dramatic .
most migrants think twice before they leave the country to which they came - often enduring considerable hardships on the way .
they know that once they go back to their home country , it will be hard to return again .
difficult data to ascertain in concrete terms how migrants are affected by the economic crisis is not easy .
many countries simply do n't have the tools to accurately document the flows of migrant workers and their financial situation in real-time , says pandya .
often it can take years until reliable data is gathered .
one of the best documented , current and most vivid examples showing how migrants are affected directly by the economic meltdown comes out of mexico .
according to the country 's central bank , the amount of money sent home by mexicans working abroad dropped by 19 percent in april of this year compared to the same month the previous year .
it was the steepest decline of so called remittances on record .
for mexico , which ranks third among countries receiving the highest remittances , the loss in revenue from abroad is significant .
the money sent home from mexicans working predominently in the united states amounted to roughly 25 billion dollars last year .
it is the country 's second largest source of income after oil exports . some experts deduct a historic reversal of the global migration trend from those numbers as well as from figures suggesting a drop in migration to the us and other countries and an increase in migrants leaving the us and other migration destinations .
however , the iom is more cautious .
spokeswoman jemini pandya argues that just because remittances are falling , it does n't necessarily mean that migrants have left the country , instead many may be simply sending less money home and trying to weather the crisis .
what 's more , says pandya , many people who are going back are planning to do so only for up to six months .
trend continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish migrant workers left britain to head home according to the iom there is no reversal of the global migration pattern .
instead , argues pandya , each country and region must be analysed individually .
in many cases , the economic crisis is n't the sole reason why migrants go back home .
" for example polish migrant workers to the uk and ireland have been returning to poland in large numbers , even actually before the financial crisis started , because the british economy had been deteriorating and the polish economy was stronger at the time and so they had already started to go back , " she says .
the same is true for brasilians leaving europe and for workers in the gulf states returning to india , pakistan and bangladesh , adds pandya .
even with the economic crisis , the iom does n't expect the total number of global migrants to drop and estimates that there will be between 210 and 214 million migrants by the end of next year .
dietrich thraenhardt also does n't predict a reversal of the long term trend toward migration , but notes that people might be inclined to be less mobile during the economic crisis .
" when the economy gets better again the migration will resume , because the structural imbalances between the poor southern world and the rich northern world with its problematic demography are still there and so the rich world needs labor from the poor world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trend toward international migration continues despite the crisis and when that happens , countries like britain , australia or malaysia , which have now scaled back the number of skilled and unskilled workers they let in , will have to ease their restrictions again .
because ultimately the fundamental labor shortages in these and many other countries can not be filled by domestic workers - even during an economic crisis , says jemini pandya : " migration never stops . "

a two-day eu conference in berlin will discuss methods to monitor migratory trends within europe . for decades the nations of the expanded european union , now comprising 27 countries , have wrangled over the integration of the eu ’ s 30 million foreign residents .
the question : how to deal with those who try to enter what human rights advocates call fortress europe ? at the berlin conference the catchwords will be “ monitoring ” and “ benchmarking , ” in other words , how to measure the success or failure of efforts to integrate so-called “ legal migrants ” across europe . residents with foreign passports make up about five percent of the eu ’ s total population of nearly 500 million .
luxembourg excels , with 38 percent of its population listed as foreigners .
germany is in mid-field at 8.9 percent or about seven-million foreign residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration policies diverge widely within the eu the german federal statistics office pointed out recently , however , that the underlying trend is far greater .
it counted those with “ migratory backgrounds , ” including persons who have adopted german citizenship and children raised in families with origins abroad .
the count soared to 15 million , or more than 18 percent of germany ’ s total population of 82 million . since the 1980s , go-it-alone policies pursued by individual nations have been superseded by an eu commission drive to coordinate a patchwork of policies on asylum and integration under a so-called global approach to migration .
adopted in 2007 , its measures range from promoting language acquisition and job skills among newcomers , to worker mobility within the eu ’ s visa-free internal borders , to frontex , the eu agency which patrols waters off northern africa . frontex often draws criticism from non-governmental organizations .
scenes of would-be migrants struggling ashore from sunken boats and recovered bodies prompted eu commission president jose manuel borroso last week to call for a summit of eu mediterranean states . aging eu will need younger workers the head of the eu ’ s social and economic committee mario sepi concedes that the demographics of an ageing eu population have also prompted europe ’ s nations to boost their efforts to successfully integrate foreigners .
by 2050 a third of the eu ’ s population will be 65 years or older , requiring many younger skilled workers including foreigners , and as taxpayers , to fill the gap . “ the european model of integration is a very broad model , " sepi said .

a two-day eu conference in berlin will discuss methods to monitor migratory trends within europe . for decades the nations of the expanded european union , now comprising 27 countries , have wrangled over the integration of the eu ’ s 30 million foreign residents .
the question : how to deal with those who try to enter what human rights advocates call fortress europe ? at the berlin conference the catchwords will be “ monitoring ” and “ benchmarking , ” in other words , how to measure the success or failure of efforts to integrate so-called “ legal migrants ” across europe . residents with foreign passports make up about five percent of the eu ’ s total population of nearly 500 million .
luxembourg excels , with 38 percent of its population listed as foreigners .
germany is in mid-field at 8.9 percent or about seven-million foreign residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration policies diverge widely within the eu the german federal statistics office pointed out recently , however , that the underlying trend is far greater .
it counted those with “ migratory backgrounds , ” including persons who have adopted german citizenship and children raised in families with origins abroad .
the count soared to 15 million , or more than 18 percent of germany ’ s total population of 82 million . since the 1980s , go-it-alone policies pursued by individual nations have been superseded by an eu commission drive to coordinate a patchwork of policies on asylum and integration under a so-called global approach to migration .
adopted in 2007 , its measures range from promoting language acquisition and job skills among newcomers , to worker mobility within the eu ’ s visa-free internal borders , to frontex , the eu agency which patrols waters off northern africa . frontex often draws criticism from non-governmental organizations .
scenes of would-be migrants struggling ashore from sunken boats and recovered bodies prompted eu commission president jose manuel borroso last week to call for a summit of eu mediterranean states . aging eu will need younger workers the head of the eu ’ s social and economic committee mario sepi concedes that the demographics of an ageing eu population have also prompted europe ’ s nations to boost their efforts to successfully integrate foreigners .
by 2050 a third of the eu ’ s population will be 65 years or older , requiring many younger skilled workers including foreigners , and as taxpayers , to fill the gap . “ the european model of integration is a very broad model , " sepi said .
" and , if we ’ re unable to integrate new citizens into the eu , then we wouldn ’ t be true to what our message to the world is : integration at -lrb- the -rrb- national , social and economic levels . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister schaeuble puts the onus on immigrants ahead of the eu ’ s berlin conference , chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble , of her conservative christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , praised the integrative efforts of more than two million so-called russian-germans who have resettled in germany since the collapse of the former soviet union . schaeuble also insisted that potential immigrants had to make the first steps . “ if you know nothing about where you live or where you ’ re going to and if you don ’ t have a basic knowledge of the language , then you ’ ll have only a small chance of making it in the new country . ” do n't exclude skilled migrants but associations representing foreigners in germany and the dgb trade union federation have advocated an alternative migration concept for 2009 , germany ’ s super election year .

even the terminology “ migrant ” and “ foreigner ” are interpreted differently from country-to-country . in a recent study , sinus researchers carsten wippermann and berthold bodo flaig dismissed negative cliches of supposedly uneducated gastarbeiter or " guest workers " recruited by germany in the 1960s , mostly from turkey . german integration three decades of research had instead shown that many migrants in germany are educationally and vocationally advanced , with a strong work ethic and modern attitudes , they said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 15.06.2009 migrants feel the brunt of the economic crisis , but the migration trend continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers in the us could be forced to send less money home the financial crisis has hit migrants especially hard .
they are often the first ones to lose their jobs , face pay cuts and harder working conditions .
still , even the current crisis wo n't stop the trend toward migration . as the economic malaise deepens and shows no clear signs of abating anytime soon , many countries around the world are turning up the pressure on migrants in an effort to ease the strain on the local labor market .
japan , a nation with few migrant laborers to begin with , introduced a program that offers latin american guest workers of japanese ancestry cash incentives if they leave the country .
in europe , spain and the czech republic are also trying to persuade workers from outside the european union to go back home by paying them money to do so .
while japan 's program bars workers who participate from returning to the country , spain 's program allows migrants to come back after three years under the condition that they have a specific work contract . it 's a natural impulse that countries are looking at curbing the number of migrant workers in times of economic turmoil , says dietrich thraenhardt , a leading migration expert who is currently a fellow at the transatlantic academy in washington .
he clearly favors the spanish incentive model for migrants .
" i think it makes sense as long as migrants are free to chose .
some migrants may want to return home and if you take for instance the funding from spain back to romania you can live better there .
but other migrants will want to stay and as long as they can chose i think it 's a good policy , " he says .
but as jemini pandya , spokeswoman for the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in geneva points out , the response to the spanish initiative has n't been dramatic .
most migrants think twice before they leave the country to which they came - often enduring considerable hardships on the way .
they know that once they go back to their home country , it will be hard to return again .
difficult data to ascertain in concrete terms how migrants are affected by the economic crisis is not easy .
many countries simply do n't have the tools to accurately document the flows of migrant workers and their financial situation in real-time , says pandya .
often it can take years until reliable data is gathered .
one of the best documented , current and most vivid examples showing how migrants are affected directly by the economic meltdown comes out of mexico .
according to the country 's central bank , the amount of money sent home by mexicans working abroad dropped by 19 percent in april of this year compared to the same month the previous year .
it was the steepest decline of so called remittances on record .
for mexico , which ranks third among countries receiving the highest remittances , the loss in revenue from abroad is significant .
the money sent home from mexicans working predominently in the united states amounted to roughly 25 billion dollars last year .
it is the country 's second largest source of income after oil exports . some experts deduct a historic reversal of the global migration trend from those numbers as well as from figures suggesting a drop in migration to the us and other countries and an increase in migrants leaving the us and other migration destinations .
however , the iom is more cautious .
spokeswoman jemini pandya argues that just because remittances are falling , it does n't necessarily mean that migrants have left the country , instead many may be simply sending less money home and trying to weather the crisis .
what 's more , says pandya , many people who are going back are planning to do so only for up to six months .
trend continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish migrant workers left britain to head home according to the iom there is no reversal of the global migration pattern .
instead , argues pandya , each country and region must be analysed individually .
in many cases , the economic crisis is n't the sole reason why migrants go back home .
" for example polish migrant workers to the uk and ireland have been returning to poland in large numbers , even actually before the financial crisis started , because the british economy had been deteriorating and the polish economy was stronger at the time and so they had already started to go back , " she says .
the same is true for brasilians leaving europe and for workers in the gulf states returning to india , pakistan and bangladesh , adds pandya .
even with the economic crisis , the iom does n't expect the total number of global migrants to drop and estimates that there will be between 210 and 214 million migrants by the end of next year .
dietrich thraenhardt also does n't predict a reversal of the long term trend toward migration , but notes that people might be inclined to be less mobile during the economic crisis .
" when the economy gets better again the migration will resume , because the structural imbalances between the poor southern world and the rich northern world with its problematic demography are still there and so the rich world needs labor from the poor world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trend toward international migration continues despite the crisis and when that happens , countries like britain , australia or malaysia , which have now scaled back the number of skilled and unskilled workers they let in , will have to ease their restrictions again .
because ultimately the fundamental labor shortages in these and many other countries can not be filled by domestic workers - even during an economic crisis , says jemini pandya : " migration never stops . "

but state aid is linked to democratic progress , she says . zimbabwean prime minister , morgan tsvangirai , has been assured of the german government ‘ s full support for his pro-democracy course .
following talks in berlin on monday , june 15 , german chancellor angela merkel said zimbabwe would receive assistance to improve its education and health systems .
however , for the time being , no direct development aid will be given to the power-sharing government led by morgan tsvangirai .
" the democratic process in zimbabwe must become stronger , " mrs merkel said , and added that direct state aid would be linked to specific conditions .
" these include a constitutional process , a land reform that revises the expropriation of farms , as well as the establishment of a functioning state administration , " she elaborated .
rallying western support morgan tsvangirai ’ s visit to berlin is part of a three-week tour of europe and the united states designed to rally political and financial support from western governments .
the zimbabwean prime minister has so far succeeded in gaining modest commitments from several countries to increase humanitarian aid channeled through non-governmental organisations .
last friday us president barack obama pledged 73 million us dollars -lrb- 53 million euros -rrb- , after britain had already promised 24 million us dollars , and norway and the netherlands smaller amounts .
morgan tvangirai said the zimbabwean unity government had made " real progress in stabilising runaway inflation and in trying to create the conditions for democracy . "
zimbabwe ’ s pm also expressed the hope that international donors would move from strictly humanitarian assistance to aid designed to spur economic recovery .
" we hope to get not only humanitarian support , but also transitional support so that we can consolidate that process and ensure that zimbabweans do n't go back to an atmosphere of fear , " he said .
sanctions to remain however , with zimbabwean hardline president robert mugabe still in control of the country ’ s security forces , western governments have made it clear they are unwilling to grant direct aid to the government until major political and economic reforms are implemented .
chancellor merkel did n't say whether the sanctions imposed on zimbabwe by the european union in response to mugabe ’ s human rights abuses would be lifted soon .
the sanctions include the denial of visas and an arms embargo , as well as a freeze on western-based assets of robert mugabe and his associates .
the measures were tightened in the wake of a campaign of violence and intimidation waged by mugabe ’ s zanu-pf militias and zimbabwean police against morgan tsvangirai ’ s movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- .
fragile government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morgan tsvangirai , left , was sworn in as prime minister by his rival , president robert mugabe , in february , 2009 .
in spite of massive state repression against the mdc and other pro-democracy groups in zimbabwe , mugabe ’ s zanu-pf lost its majority in parliament during elections in early 2008 .
as a result , mugabe was forced to agree to a power-sharing deal with morgan tsvangirai last september .
tsvangirai was sworn in as prime minister in february , 2009 .
but his relationship with president mugabe has been difficult .
tsvangirai has repeatedly said he needs to be able to show tangible results for his efforts in order to bolster his government 's standing among an impoverished population .
under the mugabe regime zimbabweans ‘ per capita income has fallen 10-fold in the past decade and the country is suffering an unemployment rate of more than 80 percent .

now she tells deutsche welle she hopes the protest movement against it succeeds - and stays peaceful . deutsche welle : what 's been your experience over the past few days ?
shahla lahiji : many , many people , not just young but middle aged and some old people , participated in the demonstrations , and last night -lrb- sunday -rrb- they attacked the campus of the students in the tehran university .
they beat them badly and took 400 students .
where they are now , we do n't know .
many within iran have said that this election stirred up more popular enthusiasm than others have . why is that ?
well , it 's the first time in our constitutional history that the wishes and hopes of the people came to something real from the candidates .
and that was one of the reasons that so many people participated .
before , many said that they would not participate in any kind of vote anymore .
this time they participated because they mentioned the freedoms that the people wanted .
and maybe it 's the reason that what happened when the results came out took place , because people knew that they were not honest and not correct , that something happened .
so it is your belief that the official result is false ?
it 's not my belief , it 's the belief of all the people who were in the streets being attacked by -lsb- basij -rsb- guards and police !
you have had a role in protest movements in the past … oh yes , i 'm one of the people who went to the berlin conference -lsb- “ iran after the elections ” -ed . -rsb- , and i went to prison for it , like mehrangiz kar or akbar ganji .
because i was against censorship .
if you go into the internet you will find a lot on my story , my life , my biography ...
yes , and the protest movement of that era , that of summer 1999 and thereafter , was eventually crushed by the government .
do you see parallels between then and now ?
yes , because what was being offered by the candidates could not be accepted by this regime .
they could not let them do this and want this , and they would not let the candidates talk like that and offer this to people .
so we knew that something would happen .
i could foresee this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi is becoming a folk hero are there parallels between what is happening now and the movement of 1978-9 .
a movement in which people are n't just criticizing one politician , or one action , they 're criticizing the whole system .
no , i am not saying that they wanted to overthrow the regime , they wanted very serious reform .
about personal freedom , human rights , and women 's rights .
they did n't like what was being done to women on the streets over the past four years by the -lsb- basij -rsb- guards , and they wanted normal contact with the world .
people may have been voting for reform of the system , but if this system has now failed them , if it has refused to listen to them , are they now going to go against the system itself ?
yes , that 's why there are so many protests !
where can this go then , if this is the people against the system ?
i do n't know , but i hope that they can continue with their demonstrations in a quiet and calm way and i hope that it does n't turn to violence because i know , if it does , it will be crushed down badly .
as they did last night in the university campus .
and now you know there is a demonstration going on that had not been allowed between two very important squares in tehran -lsb- revolution and freedom squares – ed . -rsb- and i am not participating because my legs have problems and i knew that i could not walk all that way.i hope it wo n't become violent , because i 'm sure that wo n't bring a good result .
do you think that will happen ?
well they do n't want to let the people do this .
and both sides have called this a coup d 'état – not just the protestors .
the government says it 's a “ color revolution , ” because mousavi 's supporters ' color is green , like the orange revolution in ukraine or the rose revolution in georgia and i do n't know where else .
do you expect … do you know my phone is under their control ?
you know i 'm taking a big risk to talk to you like this ... i think this is enough !

now she tells deutsche welle she hopes the protest movement against it succeeds - and stays peaceful . deutsche welle : what 's been your experience over the past few days ?
shahla lahiji : many , many people , not just young but middle aged and some old people , participated in the demonstrations , and last night -lrb- sunday -rrb- they attacked the campus of the students in the tehran university .
they beat them badly and took 400 students .
where they are now , we do n't know .
many within iran have said that this election stirred up more popular enthusiasm than others have . why is that ?
well , it 's the first time in our constitutional history that the wishes and hopes of the people came to something real from the candidates .
and that was one of the reasons that so many people participated .
before , many said that they would not participate in any kind of vote anymore .
this time they participated because they mentioned the freedoms that the people wanted .
and maybe it 's the reason that what happened when the results came out took place , because people knew that they were not honest and not correct , that something happened .
so it is your belief that the official result is false ?
it 's not my belief , it 's the belief of all the people who were in the streets being attacked by -lsb- basij -rsb- guards and police !
you have had a role in protest movements in the past … oh yes , i 'm one of the people who went to the berlin conference -lsb- “ iran after the elections ” -ed . -rsb- , and i went to prison for it , like mehrangiz kar or akbar ganji .
because i was against censorship .
if you go into the internet you will find a lot on my story , my life , my biography ...
yes , and the protest movement of that era , that of summer 1999 and thereafter , was eventually crushed by the government .
do you see parallels between then and now ?
yes , because what was being offered by the candidates could not be accepted by this regime .
they could not let them do this and want this , and they would not let the candidates talk like that and offer this to people .
so we knew that something would happen .
i could foresee this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi is becoming a folk hero are there parallels between what is happening now and the movement of 1978-9 .
a movement in which people are n't just criticizing one politician , or one action , they 're criticizing the whole system .
no , i am not saying that they wanted to overthrow the regime , they wanted very serious reform .
about personal freedom , human rights , and women 's rights .
they did n't like what was being done to women on the streets over the past four years by the -lsb- basij -rsb- guards , and they wanted normal contact with the world .
people may have been voting for reform of the system , but if this system has now failed them , if it has refused to listen to them , are they now going to go against the system itself ?
yes , that 's why there are so many protests !
where can this go then , if this is the people against the system ?
i do n't know , but i hope that they can continue with their demonstrations in a quiet and calm way and i hope that it does n't turn to violence because i know , if it does , it will be crushed down badly .
as they did last night in the university campus .
and now you know there is a demonstration going on that had not been allowed between two very important squares in tehran -lsb- revolution and freedom squares – ed . -rsb- and i am not participating because my legs have problems and i knew that i could not walk all that way.i hope it wo n't become violent , because i 'm sure that wo n't bring a good result .
do you think that will happen ?
well they do n't want to let the people do this .
and both sides have called this a coup d 'état – not just the protestors .
the government says it 's a “ color revolution , ” because mousavi 's supporters ' color is green , like the orange revolution in ukraine or the rose revolution in georgia and i do n't know where else .
do you expect … do you know my phone is under their control ?

" are we too dependent on exports ?
i believe there is no alternative to being a country with strong exports , " merkel told a conference hosted by germany 's main industry association , the bdi .
" otherwise we are putting our standard of living at risk , " she said .
merkel 's remarks came in response to warnings from economists that a slump in global trade meant that germany should take steps to boost domestic demand to offset falling foreign orders , and reduce the nation 's reliance on export markets .
germany is the world 's biggest exporter of goods , with particular strengths in the machinery , chemicals and auto sectors .
its manufacturers have been hit hard by a collapse in demand caused by the global financial crisis .
officials in berlin expect the german economy to shrink by around six percent this year , the second biggest slump among advanced economies after japan .
chancellor merkel told business delegates that the scale of the economic crisis meant world leaders must press on with the global market reforms the group of 20 leading industrial and emerging economies agreed to march this year . " we have to work further on the rules with a continuing effort , " she said .
election : what election ?
speakers at the conference in berlin included leading politicians – eager to highlight their political messages ahead of general elections in september .
chancellor angela merkel also used the conference to defend her policy of providing state aid for ailing companies . her conservative-led coalition government has faced mounting criticism for supporting general motors ' european unit opel , but turning down a bailout for the troubled german retail and tour group arcandor ag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bdi president keitel says german taxpayers should not pay for management failings opel , merkel said , was a special case , while insolvency would help lay the ground for restructuring arcandor , which operates germany 's karstadt department store chain . merkel said arcandor had been in trouble before the crisis hit germany last year , so it is not entitled to receive funds and loan guarantees .
arcandor filed for insolvency last week .
" i would n't have decided differently if germany had not been in an election campaign , " merkel told the bdi convention .
parliamentary elections are scheduled for september 27 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is merkel 's social democratic challenger for the chancellorship , said governments must be prepared to step in to help save jobs .
" to me , it concerns the future of this nation and the economy , " steinmeier told the industry delegates in berlin .
a highly risky strategy bdi president hans-peter keitel said he hoped that the government 's strategy in rescuing carmaker opel would remain an exception to the rule .
" the german taxpayer must not end up footing the bill for grave management blunders , " he said .
keitel also said the government 's economic policy should not be driven by populist efforts to win votes .
" by deciding to rescue opel , the government has displayed a kind of behaviour that it sometimes likes to accuse us business people of . "
this was a highly risky strategy that might cost the taxpayer dearly in the end , keitel added .
the bdi president also said there must be limits for industry demands for state assistance .

" are we too dependent on exports ?
i believe there is no alternative to being a country with strong exports , " merkel told a conference hosted by germany 's main industry association , the bdi .
" otherwise we are putting our standard of living at risk , " she said .
merkel 's remarks came in response to warnings from economists that a slump in global trade meant that germany should take steps to boost domestic demand to offset falling foreign orders , and reduce the nation 's reliance on export markets .
germany is the world 's biggest exporter of goods , with particular strengths in the machinery , chemicals and auto sectors .
its manufacturers have been hit hard by a collapse in demand caused by the global financial crisis .
officials in berlin expect the german economy to shrink by around six percent this year , the second biggest slump among advanced economies after japan .
chancellor merkel told business delegates that the scale of the economic crisis meant world leaders must press on with the global market reforms the group of 20 leading industrial and emerging economies agreed to march this year . " we have to work further on the rules with a continuing effort , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.06.2009 merkel defends export-heavy germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel says aid for ailing companies has nothing to do with the election german chancellor angela merkel has defended germany 's heavy dependence on exports , saying international trade would remain a key driver of growth in europe 's biggest economy . " are we too dependent on exports ?
i believe there is no alternative to being a country with strong exports , " merkel told a conference hosted by germany 's main industry association , the bdi .
" otherwise we are putting our standard of living at risk , " she said .
merkel 's remarks came in response to warnings from economists that a slump in global trade meant that germany should take steps to boost domestic demand to offset falling foreign orders , and reduce the nation 's reliance on export markets .
germany is the world 's biggest exporter of goods , with particular strengths in the machinery , chemicals and auto sectors .
its manufacturers have been hit hard by a collapse in demand caused by the global financial crisis .
officials in berlin expect the german economy to shrink by around six percent this year , the second biggest slump among advanced economies after japan .
chancellor merkel told business delegates that the scale of the economic crisis meant world leaders must press on with the global market reforms the group of 20 leading industrial and emerging economies agreed to march this year . " we have to work further on the rules with a continuing effort , " she said .
election : what election ?
speakers at the conference in berlin included leading politicians – eager to highlight their political messages ahead of general elections in september .
chancellor angela merkel also used the conference to defend her policy of providing state aid for ailing companies . her conservative-led coalition government has faced mounting criticism for supporting general motors ' european unit opel , but turning down a bailout for the troubled german retail and tour group arcandor ag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bdi president keitel says german taxpayers should not pay for management failings opel , merkel said , was a special case , while insolvency would help lay the ground for restructuring arcandor , which operates germany 's karstadt department store chain . merkel said arcandor had been in trouble before the crisis hit germany last year , so it is not entitled to receive funds and loan guarantees .
arcandor filed for insolvency last week .
" i would n't have decided differently if germany had not been in an election campaign , " merkel told the bdi convention .
parliamentary elections are scheduled for september 27 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is merkel 's social democratic challenger for the chancellorship , said governments must be prepared to step in to help save jobs .
" to me , it concerns the future of this nation and the economy , " steinmeier told the industry delegates in berlin .
a highly risky strategy bdi president hans-peter keitel said he hoped that the government 's strategy in rescuing carmaker opel would remain an exception to the rule .
" the german taxpayer must not end up footing the bill for grave management blunders , " he said .
keitel also said the government 's economic policy should not be driven by populist efforts to win votes .
" by deciding to rescue opel , the government has displayed a kind of behaviour that it sometimes likes to accuse us business people of . "
this was a highly risky strategy that might cost the taxpayer dearly in the end , keitel added .
the bdi president also said there must be limits for industry demands for state assistance .
" we should not try to make it is easy for us by turning to the government in times of crisis , " he said. db / sje / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a joint statement , eu ministers agreed that " piracy off the coast of somalia is likely to remain a serious threat . "
the extension was made now because " early agreement on extending the operation would facilitate the necessary force generation . "
international navies have deployed dozens of warships around the gulf of aden over the past year in a attempt to curb attacks by pirates threatening the busy maritime trade route .
operation atalanta currently consists of 14 ships and three aircraft .
the german contribution consists of a total of 650 personnel , two warships , one supply ship and one reconnaissance plane .
the german frigate brandenburg left the port of wilhelmshaven on monday to relieve one of the vessels already in the gulf of aden .
the parliamentary mandate for german forces deployed on the mission expires at the end of 2009 .
it is not yet clear whether that mandate will be extended to allow for further involvement now that atalanta has been prolonged .
the eu mission , which draws on forces from germany , belgium , britain , france , italy , greece , the netherlands , spain and sweden , has been operational since december 2008 .
naval officers at the mission 's headquarters in northwood , london , say atalanta forces have arrested about 70 pirates so far .
they have also escorted 28 ships chartered by the world food program on aid delivery missions throughout the region. sje / ap / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now she tells deutsche welle she hopes the protest movement against it succeeds - and stays peaceful . deutsche welle : what 's been your experience over the past few days ?
shahla lahiji : many , many people , not just young but middle aged and some old people , participated in the demonstrations , and last night -lrb- sunday -rrb- they attacked the campus of the students in the tehran university .
they beat them badly and took 400 students .
where they are now , we do n't know .
many within iran have said that this election stirred up more popular enthusiasm than others have . why is that ?
well , it 's the first time in our constitutional history that the wishes and hopes of the people came to something real from the candidates .
and that was one of the reasons that so many people participated .
before , many said that they would not participate in any kind of vote anymore .
this time they participated because they mentioned the freedoms that the people wanted .
and maybe it 's the reason that what happened when the results came out took place , because people knew that they were not honest and not correct , that something happened .
so it is your belief that the official result is false ?
it 's not my belief , it 's the belief of all the people who were in the streets being attacked by -lsb- basij -rsb- guards and police !
you have had a role in protest movements in the past … oh yes , i 'm one of the people who went to the berlin conference -lsb- “ iran after the elections ” -ed . -rsb- , and i went to prison for it , like mehrangiz kar or akbar ganji .
because i was against censorship .
if you go into the internet you will find a lot on my story , my life , my biography ...
yes , and the protest movement of that era , that of summer 1999 and thereafter , was eventually crushed by the government .
do you see parallels between then and now ?
yes , because what was being offered by the candidates could not be accepted by this regime .
they could not let them do this and want this , and they would not let the candidates talk like that and offer this to people .
so we knew that something would happen .
i could foresee this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi is becoming a folk hero are there parallels between what is happening now and the movement of 1978-9 .
a movement in which people are n't just criticizing one politician , or one action , they 're criticizing the whole system .
no , i am not saying that they wanted to overthrow the regime , they wanted very serious reform .
about personal freedom , human rights , and women 's rights .
they did n't like what was being done to women on the streets over the past four years by the -lsb- basij -rsb- guards , and they wanted normal contact with the world .
people may have been voting for reform of the system , but if this system has now failed them , if it has refused to listen to them , are they now going to go against the system itself ?
yes , that 's why there are so many protests !
where can this go then , if this is the people against the system ?
i do n't know , but i hope that they can continue with their demonstrations in a quiet and calm way and i hope that it does n't turn to violence because i know , if it does , it will be crushed down badly .
as they did last night in the university campus .
and now you know there is a demonstration going on that had not been allowed between two very important squares in tehran -lsb- revolution and freedom squares – ed . -rsb- and i am not participating because my legs have problems and i knew that i could not walk all that way.i hope it wo n't become violent , because i 'm sure that wo n't bring a good result .
do you think that will happen ?
well they do n't want to let the people do this .
and both sides have called this a coup d 'état – not just the protestors .
the government says it 's a “ color revolution , ” because mousavi 's supporters ' color is green , like the orange revolution in ukraine or the rose revolution in georgia and i do n't know where else .
do you expect … do you know my phone is under their control ?
you know i 'm taking a big risk to talk to you like this ... i think this is enough !
okay , then it 's enough !

some 526,000 jobs were cut in the last quarter of 2008 , reducing the total number of those in work across the zone to 146.2 million .
it is the third consecutive quarter in which the eurozone shed more jobs than it created , and howard archer , economist with ihs global insight , says the trend looks set to continue .
“ latest data and survey evidence point to serious weakness in eurozone labor markets in the second quarter , ” he says .
archer attributes the dramatic fall in employment opportunities to “ extended and deep economic contraction , depressed business confidence and deteriorating profitability . ”
economic output across the 16-member states shrank by an unprecedented 2.5 percent , and consumer demand , crucial to the revival of the ailing global economy , has shown no sign of picking up .
spain recorded the steepest levels of job cuts at 3.1 percent .
slovakia and greece were also struggling to keep their citizens in work , with slashes of 1.9 and 1.8 percent respectively .

the exhibition brings together leading aviation experts and business leaders from around the world .
but the mood of the air show is far from festive . the paris air show is held every two years at the le bourget airport just outside paris and is traditionally a place where contracts with airline manufacturers are inked .
but deals like the one announced monday by qatar airways for 24 airbus a320 jets are likely to be the exception at this year 's paris air show in light of the global economic recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar airways has ordered 24 airbus a320 aircraft european aircraft manufacturer airbus and american aviation company boeing are among the companies hardest hit by the global recession .
even if new orders come in , they wo n't necessarily mean a light at the end of the tunnel for either company .
many new purchases are offset by cancellations of previous deals made during the peak of an aviation industry boom , which occurred around the last paris air show two years ago .
delivery delays additionally , both companies are struggling to deliver on the large backlog of orders they still have .
the airbus a400m military transporter , which was originally scheduled for delivery at the beginning of this year , has seen major delays .
the future of the 20-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- project is at risk as some clients have threatened to cancel their orders .
boeing 's 787 dreamliner , a fuel-efficient , long-haul aircraft , has also seen its share of delays .
speculation that the dreamliner would make its first test flight at the paris air show has been put to rest by boeing representatives attending the event , who say the test flight is scheduled for the end of the month .
future of aviation industry unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 787 ' dreamliner ' was unveiled in july 2007 , but is yet to be tested in the air statements from boeing and airbus executives reflect mixed expectations when it comes to the future of the airline industry .
scott carson , head of boeing 's commercial airplanes division , said he remained optimistic that the industry would bounce back by mid-2010 . airbus chief executive tom enders did n't go so far as to say he expected a turnaround inext year , but said that 2010 and 2011 would be critical years for the aviation sector .
on top of the grim financial future of the airline industry , many questions still surround the recent crash of an air france a330 airbus in the atlantic that claimed the lives of all 228 people on board .
the plane was scheduled to land in paris after taking off from rio de janeiro on june 1 .
despite that tragedy , and the dark clouds over the future of the airline industry , attendance at the paris air show does not appear to have suffered since 2007 .
around 2,000 exhibitors from over 40 countries are in attendance , and event organizers expect about 300,000 visitors throughout the week-long exhibition. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the exhibition brings together leading aviation experts and business leaders from around the world .
but the mood of the air show is far from festive . the paris air show is held every two years at the le bourget airport just outside paris and is traditionally a place where contracts with airline manufacturers are inked .
but deals like the one announced monday by qatar airways for 24 airbus a320 jets are likely to be the exception at this year 's paris air show in light of the global economic recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar airways has ordered 24 airbus a320 aircraft european aircraft manufacturer airbus and american aviation company boeing are among the companies hardest hit by the global recession .
even if new orders come in , they wo n't necessarily mean a light at the end of the tunnel for either company .
many new purchases are offset by cancellations of previous deals made during the peak of an aviation industry boom , which occurred around the last paris air show two years ago .
delivery delays additionally , both companies are struggling to deliver on the large backlog of orders they still have .
the airbus a400m military transporter , which was originally scheduled for delivery at the beginning of this year , has seen major delays .
the future of the 20-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- project is at risk as some clients have threatened to cancel their orders .
boeing 's 787 dreamliner , a fuel-efficient , long-haul aircraft , has also seen its share of delays .
speculation that the dreamliner would make its first test flight at the paris air show has been put to rest by boeing representatives attending the event , who say the test flight is scheduled for the end of the month .
future of aviation industry unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 787 ' dreamliner ' was unveiled in july 2007 , but is yet to be tested in the air statements from boeing and airbus executives reflect mixed expectations when it comes to the future of the airline industry .
scott carson , head of boeing 's commercial airplanes division , said he remained optimistic that the industry would bounce back by mid-2010 . airbus chief executive tom enders did n't go so far as to say he expected a turnaround inext year , but said that 2010 and 2011 would be critical years for the aviation sector .

the exhibition brings together leading aviation experts and business leaders from around the world .
but the mood of the air show is far from festive . the paris air show is held every two years at the le bourget airport just outside paris and is traditionally a place where contracts with airline manufacturers are inked .
but deals like the one announced monday by qatar airways for 24 airbus a320 jets are likely to be the exception at this year 's paris air show in light of the global economic recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar airways has ordered 24 airbus a320 aircraft european aircraft manufacturer airbus and american aviation company boeing are among the companies hardest hit by the global recession .
even if new orders come in , they wo n't necessarily mean a light at the end of the tunnel for either company .
many new purchases are offset by cancellations of previous deals made during the peak of an aviation industry boom , which occurred around the last paris air show two years ago .
delivery delays additionally , both companies are struggling to deliver on the large backlog of orders they still have .
the airbus a400m military transporter , which was originally scheduled for delivery at the beginning of this year , has seen major delays .
the future of the 20-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- project is at risk as some clients have threatened to cancel their orders .
boeing 's 787 dreamliner , a fuel-efficient , long-haul aircraft , has also seen its share of delays .
speculation that the dreamliner would make its first test flight at the paris air show has been put to rest by boeing representatives attending the event , who say the test flight is scheduled for the end of the month .
future of aviation industry unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 787 ' dreamliner ' was unveiled in july 2007 , but is yet to be tested in the air statements from boeing and airbus executives reflect mixed expectations when it comes to the future of the airline industry .
scott carson , head of boeing 's commercial airplanes division , said he remained optimistic that the industry would bounce back by mid-2010 . airbus chief executive tom enders did n't go so far as to say he expected a turnaround inext year , but said that 2010 and 2011 would be critical years for the aviation sector .

"
kohout , who was in luxembourg for a meeting with his european counterparts , said there were " a number of other elements which need to be analyzed but the acceptance of the palestinian state is there . "

" whether what he mentioned can be defined as a -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state is a subject of some debate . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said there was still a long way to go .
" to secure peace means going well beyond that , without laying down any preconditions to negotiations , " he said .
restrictions and conditions in his televised announcement on sunday evening , the israeli prime minister said he was prepared to begin talks on several conditions including the demilitarization of any future palestinian state and israeli sovereignty over a united jerusalem .

proponents of the online survey hail it as a useful tool for patients , but doctors are firmly against it . the german association of health insurers -lrb- aok -rrb- has announced that insured patients , numbering around 24 million , will be able to grade their doctors ' performance and services in an online questionnaire starting next year .
online surveys already exist for a number of professions and industries in germany , including university professors , car-dealers , and nursing home staff , but a proposal to introduce a similar assessment tool for the medical community has caused a stir among doctors .

the president of the german medical association , joerg-dietrich hoppe , is also critical , saying that it is not legitimate " to use an anonymous questionnaire as a basis for rankings . "

she is charged with contempt of court over the publication of classified information . florence hartmann , who was spokeswoman for the former chief war crimes prosecutor , carla del ponte , between 2000 and 2006 , is accused of having disclosed confidential information about the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in a book and an article published after she left her post .
the publications allegedly cite confidential documents and court decisions made during the trial of former serbian leader , slobodan milosevic , which implicate the serbian state in the 1995 massacre of thousands of men and boys in the bosnian town of srebrenica .
in his opening speech , icty prosecutor bruce macfarlane said he would show that the accused had consciously published information from classified documents .
but hartmann 's lawyer , guenael mettraux , says she did no wrong as the information referred to in her article and her book , entitled “ peace and punishment : the secret wars of politics and international justice ” was already in the public domain when her work went into print . online support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte with florence hartmann the journalist 's supporters , many journalists themselves , are running an internet petition which calls for the case to be dropped .
they say hartmann was merely doing her job “ by rigorously searching for and publicizing the truth . ”
the petition goes on to say that making hartmann appear before a court established to try those guilty of genocide “ will tarnish the image of the international justice system . ”
hartmann , who could face seven years in prison or a fine of € 100,000 -lrb- $ 139,000 -rrb- if found guilty , declined to enter a plea on either charge .
the court entered two pleas of “ not guilty ” on her behalf .
the trial is expected to continue until wednesday. tkw / afp / ap / dpa editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but state aid is linked to democratic progress , she says . zimbabwean prime minister , morgan tsvangirai , has been assured of the german government ‘ s full support for his pro-democracy course .
following talks in berlin on monday , june 15 , german chancellor angela merkel said zimbabwe would receive assistance to improve its education and health systems .
however , for the time being , no direct development aid will be given to the power-sharing government led by morgan tsvangirai .
" the democratic process in zimbabwe must become stronger , " mrs merkel said , and added that direct state aid would be linked to specific conditions .
" these include a constitutional process , a land reform that revises the expropriation of farms , as well as the establishment of a functioning state administration , " she elaborated .
rallying western support morgan tsvangirai ’ s visit to berlin is part of a three-week tour of europe and the united states designed to rally political and financial support from western governments .
the zimbabwean prime minister has so far succeeded in gaining modest commitments from several countries to increase humanitarian aid channeled through non-governmental organisations .
last friday us president barack obama pledged 73 million us dollars -lrb- 53 million euros -rrb- , after britain had already promised 24 million us dollars , and norway and the netherlands smaller amounts .
morgan tvangirai said the zimbabwean unity government had made " real progress in stabilising runaway inflation and in trying to create the conditions for democracy . "
zimbabwe ’ s pm also expressed the hope that international donors would move from strictly humanitarian assistance to aid designed to spur economic recovery .
" we hope to get not only humanitarian support , but also transitional support so that we can consolidate that process and ensure that zimbabweans do n't go back to an atmosphere of fear , " he said .
sanctions to remain however , with zimbabwean hardline president robert mugabe still in control of the country ’ s security forces , western governments have made it clear they are unwilling to grant direct aid to the government until major political and economic reforms are implemented .
chancellor merkel did n't say whether the sanctions imposed on zimbabwe by the european union in response to mugabe ’ s human rights abuses would be lifted soon .
the sanctions include the denial of visas and an arms embargo , as well as a freeze on western-based assets of robert mugabe and his associates .
the measures were tightened in the wake of a campaign of violence and intimidation waged by mugabe ’ s zanu-pf militias and zimbabwean police against morgan tsvangirai ’ s movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- .
fragile government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morgan tsvangirai , left , was sworn in as prime minister by his rival , president robert mugabe , in february , 2009 .
in spite of massive state repression against the mdc and other pro-democracy groups in zimbabwe , mugabe ’ s zanu-pf lost its majority in parliament during elections in early 2008 .
as a result , mugabe was forced to agree to a power-sharing deal with morgan tsvangirai last september .
tsvangirai was sworn in as prime minister in february , 2009 .
but his relationship with president mugabe has been difficult .
tsvangirai has repeatedly said he needs to be able to show tangible results for his efforts in order to bolster his government 's standing among an impoverished population .
under the mugabe regime zimbabweans ‘ per capita income has fallen 10-fold in the past decade and the country is suffering an unemployment rate of more than 80 percent .

the sanctions include the denial of visas and an arms embargo , as well as a freeze on western-based assets of robert mugabe and his associates .
the measures were tightened in the wake of a campaign of violence and intimidation waged by mugabe ’ s zanu-pf militias and zimbabwean police against morgan tsvangirai ’ s movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- .
fragile government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morgan tsvangirai , left , was sworn in as prime minister by his rival , president robert mugabe , in february , 2009 .
in spite of massive state repression against the mdc and other pro-democracy groups in zimbabwe , mugabe ’ s zanu-pf lost its majority in parliament during elections in early 2008 .
as a result , mugabe was forced to agree to a power-sharing deal with morgan tsvangirai last september .
tsvangirai was sworn in as prime minister in february , 2009 .
but his relationship with president mugabe has been difficult .
tsvangirai has repeatedly said he needs to be able to show tangible results for his efforts in order to bolster his government 's standing among an impoverished population .
under the mugabe regime zimbabweans ‘ per capita income has fallen 10-fold in the past decade and the country is suffering an unemployment rate of more than 80 percent .

now she tells deutsche welle she hopes the protest movement against it succeeds - and stays peaceful . deutsche welle : what 's been your experience over the past few days ?
shahla lahiji : many , many people , not just young but middle aged and some old people , participated in the demonstrations , and last night -lrb- sunday -rrb- they attacked the campus of the students in the tehran university .
they beat them badly and took 400 students .
where they are now , we do n't know .
many within iran have said that this election stirred up more popular enthusiasm than others have . why is that ?
well , it 's the first time in our constitutional history that the wishes and hopes of the people came to something real from the candidates .
and that was one of the reasons that so many people participated .
before , many said that they would not participate in any kind of vote anymore .
this time they participated because they mentioned the freedoms that the people wanted .
and maybe it 's the reason that what happened when the results came out took place , because people knew that they were not honest and not correct , that something happened .
so it is your belief that the official result is false ?
it 's not my belief , it 's the belief of all the people who were in the streets being attacked by -lsb- basij -rsb- guards and police !
you have had a role in protest movements in the past … oh yes , i 'm one of the people who went to the berlin conference -lsb- “ iran after the elections ” -ed . -rsb- , and i went to prison for it , like mehrangiz kar or akbar ganji .
because i was against censorship .
if you go into the internet you will find a lot on my story , my life , my biography ...
yes , and the protest movement of that era , that of summer 1999 and thereafter , was eventually crushed by the government .
do you see parallels between then and now ?
yes , because what was being offered by the candidates could not be accepted by this regime .
they could not let them do this and want this , and they would not let the candidates talk like that and offer this to people .
so we knew that something would happen .
i could foresee this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi is becoming a folk hero are there parallels between what is happening now and the movement of 1978-9 .
a movement in which people are n't just criticizing one politician , or one action , they 're criticizing the whole system .
no , i am not saying that they wanted to overthrow the regime , they wanted very serious reform .
about personal freedom , human rights , and women 's rights .
they did n't like what was being done to women on the streets over the past four years by the -lsb- basij -rsb- guards , and they wanted normal contact with the world .
people may have been voting for reform of the system , but if this system has now failed them , if it has refused to listen to them , are they now going to go against the system itself ?
yes , that 's why there are so many protests !
where can this go then , if this is the people against the system ?
i do n't know , but i hope that they can continue with their demonstrations in a quiet and calm way and i hope that it does n't turn to violence because i know , if it does , it will be crushed down badly .
as they did last night in the university campus .
and now you know there is a demonstration going on that had not been allowed between two very important squares in tehran -lsb- revolution and freedom squares – ed . -rsb- and i am not participating because my legs have problems and i knew that i could not walk all that way.i hope it wo n't become violent , because i 'm sure that wo n't bring a good result .
do you think that will happen ?
well they do n't want to let the people do this .
and both sides have called this a coup d 'état – not just the protestors .
the government says it 's a “ color revolution , ” because mousavi 's supporters ' color is green , like the orange revolution in ukraine or the rose revolution in georgia and i do n't know where else .
do you expect … do you know my phone is under their control ?
you know i 'm taking a big risk to talk to you like this ... i think this is enough !
okay , then it 's enough !

now she tells deutsche welle she hopes the protest movement against it succeeds - and stays peaceful . deutsche welle : what 's been your experience over the past few days ?
shahla lahiji : many , many people , not just young but middle aged and some old people , participated in the demonstrations , and last night -lrb- sunday -rrb- they attacked the campus of the students in the tehran university .
they beat them badly and took 400 students .
where they are now , we do n't know .
many within iran have said that this election stirred up more popular enthusiasm than others have . why is that ?
well , it 's the first time in our constitutional history that the wishes and hopes of the people came to something real from the candidates .
and that was one of the reasons that so many people participated .
before , many said that they would not participate in any kind of vote anymore .
this time they participated because they mentioned the freedoms that the people wanted .
and maybe it 's the reason that what happened when the results came out took place , because people knew that they were not honest and not correct , that something happened .
so it is your belief that the official result is false ?
it 's not my belief , it 's the belief of all the people who were in the streets being attacked by -lsb- basij -rsb- guards and police !
you have had a role in protest movements in the past … oh yes , i 'm one of the people who went to the berlin conference -lsb- “ iran after the elections ” -ed . -rsb- , and i went to prison for it , like mehrangiz kar or akbar ganji .
because i was against censorship .
if you go into the internet you will find a lot on my story , my life , my biography ...
yes , and the protest movement of that era , that of summer 1999 and thereafter , was eventually crushed by the government .
do you see parallels between then and now ?
yes , because what was being offered by the candidates could not be accepted by this regime .
they could not let them do this and want this , and they would not let the candidates talk like that and offer this to people .
so we knew that something would happen .
i could foresee this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi is becoming a folk hero are there parallels between what is happening now and the movement of 1978-9 .
a movement in which people are n't just criticizing one politician , or one action , they 're criticizing the whole system .
no , i am not saying that they wanted to overthrow the regime , they wanted very serious reform .
about personal freedom , human rights , and women 's rights .
they did n't like what was being done to women on the streets over the past four years by the -lsb- basij -rsb- guards , and they wanted normal contact with the world .
people may have been voting for reform of the system , but if this system has now failed them , if it has refused to listen to them , are they now going to go against the system itself ?
yes , that 's why there are so many protests !
where can this go then , if this is the people against the system ?
i do n't know , but i hope that they can continue with their demonstrations in a quiet and calm way and i hope that it does n't turn to violence because i know , if it does , it will be crushed down badly .
as they did last night in the university campus .
and now you know there is a demonstration going on that had not been allowed between two very important squares in tehran -lsb- revolution and freedom squares – ed . -rsb- and i am not participating because my legs have problems and i knew that i could not walk all that way.i hope it wo n't become violent , because i 'm sure that wo n't bring a good result .
do you think that will happen ?
well they do n't want to let the people do this .
and both sides have called this a coup d 'état – not just the protestors .
the government says it 's a “ color revolution , ” because mousavi 's supporters ' color is green , like the orange revolution in ukraine or the rose revolution in georgia and i do n't know where else .
do you expect … do you know my phone is under their control ?
you know i 'm taking a big risk to talk to you like this ... i think this is enough !
okay , then it 's enough !

" are we too dependent on exports ?
i believe there is no alternative to being a country with strong exports , " merkel told a conference hosted by germany 's main industry association , the bdi .
" otherwise we are putting our standard of living at risk , " she said .
merkel 's remarks came in response to warnings from economists that a slump in global trade meant that germany should take steps to boost domestic demand to offset falling foreign orders , and reduce the nation 's reliance on export markets .
germany is the world 's biggest exporter of goods , with particular strengths in the machinery , chemicals and auto sectors .
its manufacturers have been hit hard by a collapse in demand caused by the global financial crisis .
officials in berlin expect the german economy to shrink by around six percent this year , the second biggest slump among advanced economies after japan .
chancellor merkel told business delegates that the scale of the economic crisis meant world leaders must press on with the global market reforms the group of 20 leading industrial and emerging economies agreed to march this year . " we have to work further on the rules with a continuing effort , " she said .
election : what election ?
speakers at the conference in berlin included leading politicians – eager to highlight their political messages ahead of general elections in september .
chancellor angela merkel also used the conference to defend her policy of providing state aid for ailing companies . her conservative-led coalition government has faced mounting criticism for supporting general motors ' european unit opel , but turning down a bailout for the troubled german retail and tour group arcandor ag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bdi president keitel says german taxpayers should not pay for management failings opel , merkel said , was a special case , while insolvency would help lay the ground for restructuring arcandor , which operates germany 's karstadt department store chain . merkel said arcandor had been in trouble before the crisis hit germany last year , so it is not entitled to receive funds and loan guarantees .
arcandor filed for insolvency last week .
" i would n't have decided differently if germany had not been in an election campaign , " merkel told the bdi convention .
parliamentary elections are scheduled for september 27 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is merkel 's social democratic challenger for the chancellorship , said governments must be prepared to step in to help save jobs .
" to me , it concerns the future of this nation and the economy , " steinmeier told the industry delegates in berlin .
a highly risky strategy bdi president hans-peter keitel said he hoped that the government 's strategy in rescuing carmaker opel would remain an exception to the rule .
" the german taxpayer must not end up footing the bill for grave management blunders , " he said .
keitel also said the government 's economic policy should not be driven by populist efforts to win votes .
" by deciding to rescue opel , the government has displayed a kind of behaviour that it sometimes likes to accuse us business people of . "
this was a highly risky strategy that might cost the taxpayer dearly in the end , keitel added .
the bdi president also said there must be limits for industry demands for state assistance .

" are we too dependent on exports ?
i believe there is no alternative to being a country with strong exports , " merkel told a conference hosted by germany 's main industry association , the bdi .
" otherwise we are putting our standard of living at risk , " she said .
merkel 's remarks came in response to warnings from economists that a slump in global trade meant that germany should take steps to boost domestic demand to offset falling foreign orders , and reduce the nation 's reliance on export markets .
germany is the world 's biggest exporter of goods , with particular strengths in the machinery , chemicals and auto sectors .
its manufacturers have been hit hard by a collapse in demand caused by the global financial crisis .
officials in berlin expect the german economy to shrink by around six percent this year , the second biggest slump among advanced economies after japan .
chancellor merkel told business delegates that the scale of the economic crisis meant world leaders must press on with the global market reforms the group of 20 leading industrial and emerging economies agreed to march this year . " we have to work further on the rules with a continuing effort , " she said .
election : what election ?
speakers at the conference in berlin included leading politicians – eager to highlight their political messages ahead of general elections in september .
chancellor angela merkel also used the conference to defend her policy of providing state aid for ailing companies . her conservative-led coalition government has faced mounting criticism for supporting general motors ' european unit opel , but turning down a bailout for the troubled german retail and tour group arcandor ag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bdi president keitel says german taxpayers should not pay for management failings opel , merkel said , was a special case , while insolvency would help lay the ground for restructuring arcandor , which operates germany 's karstadt department store chain . merkel said arcandor had been in trouble before the crisis hit germany last year , so it is not entitled to receive funds and loan guarantees .
arcandor filed for insolvency last week .
" i would n't have decided differently if germany had not been in an election campaign , " merkel told the bdi convention .
parliamentary elections are scheduled for september 27 .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is merkel 's social democratic challenger for the chancellorship , said governments must be prepared to step in to help save jobs .
" to me , it concerns the future of this nation and the economy , " steinmeier told the industry delegates in berlin .
a highly risky strategy bdi president hans-peter keitel said he hoped that the government 's strategy in rescuing carmaker opel would remain an exception to the rule .
" the german taxpayer must not end up footing the bill for grave management blunders , " he said .
keitel also said the government 's economic policy should not be driven by populist efforts to win votes .
" by deciding to rescue opel , the government has displayed a kind of behaviour that it sometimes likes to accuse us business people of . "
this was a highly risky strategy that might cost the taxpayer dearly in the end , keitel added .
the bdi president also said there must be limits for industry demands for state assistance .
" we should not try to make it is easy for us by turning to the government in times of crisis , " he said. db / sje / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a joint statement , eu ministers agreed that " piracy off the coast of somalia is likely to remain a serious threat . "
the extension was made now because " early agreement on extending the operation would facilitate the necessary force generation . "
international navies have deployed dozens of warships around the gulf of aden over the past year in a attempt to curb attacks by pirates threatening the busy maritime trade route .
operation atalanta currently consists of 14 ships and three aircraft .
the german contribution consists of a total of 650 personnel , two warships , one supply ship and one reconnaissance plane .
the german frigate brandenburg left the port of wilhelmshaven on monday to relieve one of the vessels already in the gulf of aden .
the parliamentary mandate for german forces deployed on the mission expires at the end of 2009 .
it is not yet clear whether that mandate will be extended to allow for further involvement now that atalanta has been prolonged .
the eu mission , which draws on forces from germany , belgium , britain , france , italy , greece , the netherlands , spain and sweden , has been operational since december 2008 .
naval officers at the mission 's headquarters in northwood , london , say atalanta forces have arrested about 70 pirates so far .
they have also escorted 28 ships chartered by the world food program on aid delivery missions throughout the region. sje / ap / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a joint statement , eu ministers agreed that " piracy off the coast of somalia is likely to remain a serious threat . "
the extension was made now because " early agreement on extending the operation would facilitate the necessary force generation . "
international navies have deployed dozens of warships around the gulf of aden over the past year in a attempt to curb attacks by pirates threatening the busy maritime trade route .
operation atalanta currently consists of 14 ships and three aircraft .
the german contribution consists of a total of 650 personnel , two warships , one supply ship and one reconnaissance plane .
the german frigate brandenburg left the port of wilhelmshaven on monday to relieve one of the vessels already in the gulf of aden .
the parliamentary mandate for german forces deployed on the mission expires at the end of 2009 .
it is not yet clear whether that mandate will be extended to allow for further involvement now that atalanta has been prolonged .
the eu mission , which draws on forces from germany , belgium , britain , france , italy , greece , the netherlands , spain and sweden , has been operational since december 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 15.06.2009 iran muzzles press as post-election demonstrations continue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran is seeing its most serious unrest in a decade .
while opposition supporters protest the election results that put president mahmoud ahmadinejad back in office , international news organizations say they are being prevented from reporting on the escalating events . german public broadcasters zdf and ard say their journalists are being prevented from doing their jobs , with the zdf team barred from reporting and ard correspondent peter mezger no longer allowed to leave his hotel .
the journalist told the bayrischer rundfunk television network that the situation had escalated after ahmadinejad accused foreign press of blowing the demonstrations out of proportion .
metzger said militiamen had taken the president 's words as a call to action and had clamped down on international media as a result .
he said a group of six men had appeared in the ard office in tehran armed with truncheons and electronic shock devices , and had taken one of his colleagues with them .
his whereabouts is still unkown .
in a letter to the iranian ambassador in berlin , the editors-in-chief of the two stations , said : “ we see a breach of freedom of the press and democratic principles . ”
they insisted , however , that they would continue to report in a “ critical , fair and independent ” manner .
electronic jamming the bbc has also reported difficulties .
it says the satellites it uses for its persian radio and television services have been affected by “ heavy electronic jamming ” which was becoming “ progressively worse . ”
technicians have traced the jam back to iran .
bildunterschrift : broadcasters want the freedom to report on what is happening director of the bbc world service , peter horrocks , said that any attempt to block its broadcasts was “ wrong and against international treaties on satellite communication . ”
he added that it appeared to be “ part of a pattern of behavior by the iranian authorities to limit the reporting of the aftermath of the disputed election . ”
the ap news agency said it had been told by government representatives not to deliver any footage to the bbc persian service , which is very popular in iran , or to voice of america .
whatever it takes a dutch television crew for public broadcaster nederland 2 said one of its journalists and cameramen had been arrested while filming outside the headquarters of ahmadinejad 's closest challenger , mir hossein mousavi .
“ they were pushed against a wall and their tapes were seized .
their filming permits were withdrawn and they had to leave the country immediately , ” nederland 2 said in a statement .
the arab news station al-arabiya was shut down for a week , while a spanish journalist also reported the confiscation of footage of some of the post-election protests .
press inside iran has shown very little sign of the ongoing unrest and an editor of the pro-mousavi newspaper kalemeh sabs said the authorities had forbidden the distribution of the paper on sunday .
deeply concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has called for clarity over iran elections meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has expressed his concern about the mounting tension in tehran and has summoned the iranian ambassador .

she is charged with contempt of court over the publication of classified information . florence hartmann , who was spokeswoman for the former chief war crimes prosecutor , carla del ponte , between 2000 and 2006 , is accused of having disclosed confidential information about the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in a book and an article published after she left her post .
the publications allegedly cite confidential documents and court decisions made during the trial of former serbian leader , slobodan milosevic , which implicate the serbian state in the 1995 massacre of thousands of men and boys in the bosnian town of srebrenica .
in his opening speech , icty prosecutor bruce macfarlane said he would show that the accused had consciously published information from classified documents .

they say hartmann was merely doing her job “ by rigorously searching for and publicizing the truth . ”
the petition goes on to say that making hartmann appear before a court established to try those guilty of genocide “ will tarnish the image of the international justice system . ”
hartmann , who could face seven years in prison or a fine of € 100,000 -lrb- $ 139,000 -rrb- if found guilty , declined to enter a plea on either charge .
the court entered two pleas of “ not guilty ” on her behalf .

the journalist told the bayrischer rundfunk television network that the situation had escalated after ahmadinejad accused foreign press of blowing the demonstrations out of proportion .
metzger said militiamen had taken the president 's words as a call to action and had clamped down on international media as a result .
he said a group of six men had appeared in the ard office in tehran armed with truncheons and electronic shock devices , and had taken one of his colleagues with them .

a two-day eu conference in berlin will discuss methods to monitor migratory trends within europe . for decades the nations of the expanded european union , now comprising 27 countries , have wrangled over the integration of the eu ’ s 30 million foreign residents .
the question : how to deal with those who try to enter what human rights advocates call fortress europe ? at the berlin conference the catchwords will be “ monitoring ” and “ benchmarking , ” in other words , how to measure the success or failure of efforts to integrate so-called “ legal migrants ” across europe . residents with foreign passports make up about five percent of the eu ’ s total population of nearly 500 million .
luxembourg excels , with 38 percent of its population listed as foreigners .
germany is in mid-field at 8.9 percent or about seven-million foreign residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration policies diverge widely within the eu the german federal statistics office pointed out recently , however , that the underlying trend is far greater .
it counted those with “ migratory backgrounds , ” including persons who have adopted german citizenship and children raised in families with origins abroad .
the count soared to 15 million , or more than 18 percent of germany ’ s total population of 82 million . since the 1980s , go-it-alone policies pursued by individual nations have been superseded by an eu commission drive to coordinate a patchwork of policies on asylum and integration under a so-called global approach to migration .
adopted in 2007 , its measures range from promoting language acquisition and job skills among newcomers , to worker mobility within the eu ’ s visa-free internal borders , to frontex , the eu agency which patrols waters off northern africa . frontex often draws criticism from non-governmental organizations .
scenes of would-be migrants struggling ashore from sunken boats and recovered bodies prompted eu commission president jose manuel borroso last week to call for a summit of eu mediterranean states . aging eu will need younger workers the head of the eu ’ s social and economic committee mario sepi concedes that the demographics of an ageing eu population have also prompted europe ’ s nations to boost their efforts to successfully integrate foreigners .
by 2050 a third of the eu ’ s population will be 65 years or older , requiring many younger skilled workers including foreigners , and as taxpayers , to fill the gap . “ the european model of integration is a very broad model , " sepi said .
" and , if we ’ re unable to integrate new citizens into the eu , then we wouldn ’ t be true to what our message to the world is : integration at -lrb- the -rrb- national , social and economic levels . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister schaeuble puts the onus on immigrants ahead of the eu ’ s berlin conference , chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal interior minister , wolfgang schaeuble , of her conservative christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , praised the integrative efforts of more than two million so-called russian-germans who have resettled in germany since the collapse of the former soviet union . schaeuble also insisted that potential immigrants had to make the first steps . “ if you know nothing about where you live or where you ’ re going to and if you don ’ t have a basic knowledge of the language , then you ’ ll have only a small chance of making it in the new country . ” do n't exclude skilled migrants but associations representing foreigners in germany and the dgb trade union federation have advocated an alternative migration concept for 2009 , germany ’ s super election year .
one group , pro-asylum , says recruitment of skilled migrants should not lead to situations where refugees find it increasingly difficult to obtain asylum in the european union . experts , including staff at the sinus social research institute in heidelberg , say the migratory policies and trends across the eu ’ s 27 nations are very diverse .
even the terminology “ migrant ” and “ foreigner ” are interpreted differently from country-to-country . in a recent study , sinus researchers carsten wippermann and berthold bodo flaig dismissed negative cliches of supposedly uneducated gastarbeiter or " guest workers " recruited by germany in the 1960s , mostly from turkey . german integration three decades of research had instead shown that many migrants in germany are educationally and vocationally advanced , with a strong work ethic and modern attitudes , they said . " among a broad cross-section of the migrant population there is a high degree of cultural adaption and willingness to integrate .
many have a bicultural self-definition .
that means , they don ’ t even regard themselves as ' migrants ' but as an obvious part of german society , " the researchers said . those results are reflected in a new study by germany ’ s allensbach research institute .
it says 69 percent of migrants feel comfortable in germany ; and 58 percent regard themselves as part of german society .
amongst turkish migrants , however , a quarter said they still felt as if they were foreign or different . ipj / epd / kna / bpb / apuz / eurostats editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the exhibition brings together leading aviation experts and business leaders from around the world .
but the mood of the air show is far from festive . the paris air show is held every two years at the le bourget airport just outside paris and is traditionally a place where contracts with airline manufacturers are inked .
but deals like the one announced monday by qatar airways for 24 airbus a320 jets are likely to be the exception at this year 's paris air show in light of the global economic recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar airways has ordered 24 airbus a320 aircraft european aircraft manufacturer airbus and american aviation company boeing are among the companies hardest hit by the global recession .
even if new orders come in , they wo n't necessarily mean a light at the end of the tunnel for either company .
many new purchases are offset by cancellations of previous deals made during the peak of an aviation industry boom , which occurred around the last paris air show two years ago .
delivery delays additionally , both companies are struggling to deliver on the large backlog of orders they still have .
the airbus a400m military transporter , which was originally scheduled for delivery at the beginning of this year , has seen major delays .
the future of the 20-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- project is at risk as some clients have threatened to cancel their orders .
boeing 's 787 dreamliner , a fuel-efficient , long-haul aircraft , has also seen its share of delays .
speculation that the dreamliner would make its first test flight at the paris air show has been put to rest by boeing representatives attending the event , who say the test flight is scheduled for the end of the month .
future of aviation industry unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 787 ' dreamliner ' was unveiled in july 2007 , but is yet to be tested in the air statements from boeing and airbus executives reflect mixed expectations when it comes to the future of the airline industry .
scott carson , head of boeing 's commercial airplanes division , said he remained optimistic that the industry would bounce back by mid-2010 . airbus chief executive tom enders did n't go so far as to say he expected a turnaround inext year , but said that 2010 and 2011 would be critical years for the aviation sector .
on top of the grim financial future of the airline industry , many questions still surround the recent crash of an air france a330 airbus in the atlantic that claimed the lives of all 228 people on board .
the plane was scheduled to land in paris after taking off from rio de janeiro on june 1 .
despite that tragedy , and the dark clouds over the future of the airline industry , attendance at the paris air show does not appear to have suffered since 2007 .
around 2,000 exhibitors from over 40 countries are in attendance , and event organizers expect about 300,000 visitors throughout the week-long exhibition. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the exhibition brings together leading aviation experts and business leaders from around the world .
but the mood of the air show is far from festive . the paris air show is held every two years at the le bourget airport just outside paris and is traditionally a place where contracts with airline manufacturers are inked .
but deals like the one announced monday by qatar airways for 24 airbus a320 jets are likely to be the exception at this year 's paris air show in light of the global economic recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar airways has ordered 24 airbus a320 aircraft european aircraft manufacturer airbus and american aviation company boeing are among the companies hardest hit by the global recession .
even if new orders come in , they wo n't necessarily mean a light at the end of the tunnel for either company .
many new purchases are offset by cancellations of previous deals made during the peak of an aviation industry boom , which occurred around the last paris air show two years ago .
delivery delays additionally , both companies are struggling to deliver on the large backlog of orders they still have .
the airbus a400m military transporter , which was originally scheduled for delivery at the beginning of this year , has seen major delays .
the future of the 20-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- project is at risk as some clients have threatened to cancel their orders .
boeing 's 787 dreamliner , a fuel-efficient , long-haul aircraft , has also seen its share of delays .
speculation that the dreamliner would make its first test flight at the paris air show has been put to rest by boeing representatives attending the event , who say the test flight is scheduled for the end of the month .

"
kohout , who was in luxembourg for a meeting with his european counterparts , said there were " a number of other elements which need to be analyzed but the acceptance of the palestinian state is there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister bernard kouchner says there can be no conditions speaking to reporters in luxembourg , foreign minister to sweden , carl bildt , echoed his czech colleague 's view .
" the fact that he uttered the word ' state ' is a small step forward , " he said .
" whether what he mentioned can be defined as a -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state is a subject of some debate . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said there was still a long way to go .
" to secure peace means going well beyond that , without laying down any preconditions to negotiations , " he said .
restrictions and conditions in his televised announcement on sunday evening , the israeli prime minister said he was prepared to begin talks on several conditions including the demilitarization of any future palestinian state and israeli sovereignty over a united jerusalem .
the provisions have angered palestinians , and cypriot foreign minister markos kyprianou said they were " not what the eu expects . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu wants closer ties with the eu eu foreign ministers say that although netanyahu 's announcement is a step in the right direction , it is too soon to talk about an upgrade - a strengthening of ties - in eu-israeli relations .
luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said : " we should n't talk about an upgrade with israel if we do n't manage to unblock the -lrb- peace talks -rrb- process in a very positive way . "
the ministers agreed to the upgrade in principle last year , but the issue was sidelined in december following israel 's assault on the gaza strip .
since then , the eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner has said there will be no strengthening of ties until such time as the israeli government commits to peace talks with the palestinians .
israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman was due to join his eu counterparts in luxembourg on monday evening. tkw / reuters / afp / ap editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 15.06.2009 migrants feel the brunt of the economic crisis , but the migration trend continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers in the us could be forced to send less money home the financial crisis has hit migrants especially hard .
they are often the first ones to lose their jobs , face pay cuts and harder working conditions .
still , even the current crisis wo n't stop the trend toward migration . as the economic malaise deepens and shows no clear signs of abating anytime soon , many countries around the world are turning up the pressure on migrants in an effort to ease the strain on the local labor market .
japan , a nation with few migrant laborers to begin with , introduced a program that offers latin american guest workers of japanese ancestry cash incentives if they leave the country .
in europe , spain and the czech republic are also trying to persuade workers from outside the european union to go back home by paying them money to do so .
while japan 's program bars workers who participate from returning to the country , spain 's program allows migrants to come back after three years under the condition that they have a specific work contract . it 's a natural impulse that countries are looking at curbing the number of migrant workers in times of economic turmoil , says dietrich thraenhardt , a leading migration expert who is currently a fellow at the transatlantic academy in washington .
he clearly favors the spanish incentive model for migrants .
" i think it makes sense as long as migrants are free to chose .
some migrants may want to return home and if you take for instance the funding from spain back to romania you can live better there .
but other migrants will want to stay and as long as they can chose i think it 's a good policy , " he says .
but as jemini pandya , spokeswoman for the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in geneva points out , the response to the spanish initiative has n't been dramatic .
most migrants think twice before they leave the country to which they came - often enduring considerable hardships on the way .
they know that once they go back to their home country , it will be hard to return again .
difficult data to ascertain in concrete terms how migrants are affected by the economic crisis is not easy .
many countries simply do n't have the tools to accurately document the flows of migrant workers and their financial situation in real-time , says pandya .
often it can take years until reliable data is gathered .
one of the best documented , current and most vivid examples showing how migrants are affected directly by the economic meltdown comes out of mexico .
according to the country 's central bank , the amount of money sent home by mexicans working abroad dropped by 19 percent in april of this year compared to the same month the previous year .
it was the steepest decline of so called remittances on record .
for mexico , which ranks third among countries receiving the highest remittances , the loss in revenue from abroad is significant .
the money sent home from mexicans working predominently in the united states amounted to roughly 25 billion dollars last year .
it is the country 's second largest source of income after oil exports . some experts deduct a historic reversal of the global migration trend from those numbers as well as from figures suggesting a drop in migration to the us and other countries and an increase in migrants leaving the us and other migration destinations .
however , the iom is more cautious .
spokeswoman jemini pandya argues that just because remittances are falling , it does n't necessarily mean that migrants have left the country , instead many may be simply sending less money home and trying to weather the crisis .
what 's more , says pandya , many people who are going back are planning to do so only for up to six months .
trend continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish migrant workers left britain to head home according to the iom there is no reversal of the global migration pattern .
instead , argues pandya , each country and region must be analysed individually .
in many cases , the economic crisis is n't the sole reason why migrants go back home .
" for example polish migrant workers to the uk and ireland have been returning to poland in large numbers , even actually before the financial crisis started , because the british economy had been deteriorating and the polish economy was stronger at the time and so they had already started to go back , " she says .
the same is true for brasilians leaving europe and for workers in the gulf states returning to india , pakistan and bangladesh , adds pandya .
even with the economic crisis , the iom does n't expect the total number of global migrants to drop and estimates that there will be between 210 and 214 million migrants by the end of next year .
dietrich thraenhardt also does n't predict a reversal of the long term trend toward migration , but notes that people might be inclined to be less mobile during the economic crisis .
" when the economy gets better again the migration will resume , because the structural imbalances between the poor southern world and the rich northern world with its problematic demography are still there and so the rich world needs labor from the poor world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trend toward international migration continues despite the crisis and when that happens , countries like britain , australia or malaysia , which have now scaled back the number of skilled and unskilled workers they let in , will have to ease their restrictions again .
because ultimately the fundamental labor shortages in these and many other countries can not be filled by domestic workers - even during an economic crisis , says jemini pandya : " migration never stops . "

they are often the first ones to lose their jobs , face pay cuts and harder working conditions .
still , even the current crisis wo n't stop the trend toward migration . as the economic malaise deepens and shows no clear signs of abating anytime soon , many countries around the world are turning up the pressure on migrants in an effort to ease the strain on the local labor market .
japan , a nation with few migrant laborers to begin with , introduced a program that offers latin american guest workers of japanese ancestry cash incentives if they leave the country .
in europe , spain and the czech republic are also trying to persuade workers from outside the european union to go back home by paying them money to do so .
while japan 's program bars workers who participate from returning to the country , spain 's program allows migrants to come back after three years under the condition that they have a specific work contract . it 's a natural impulse that countries are looking at curbing the number of migrant workers in times of economic turmoil , says dietrich thraenhardt , a leading migration expert who is currently a fellow at the transatlantic academy in washington .
he clearly favors the spanish incentive model for migrants .
" i think it makes sense as long as migrants are free to chose .
some migrants may want to return home and if you take for instance the funding from spain back to romania you can live better there .
but other migrants will want to stay and as long as they can chose i think it 's a good policy , " he says .
but as jemini pandya , spokeswoman for the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in geneva points out , the response to the spanish initiative has n't been dramatic .
most migrants think twice before they leave the country to which they came - often enduring considerable hardships on the way .
they know that once they go back to their home country , it will be hard to return again .
difficult data to ascertain in concrete terms how migrants are affected by the economic crisis is not easy .
many countries simply do n't have the tools to accurately document the flows of migrant workers and their financial situation in real-time , says pandya .
often it can take years until reliable data is gathered .
one of the best documented , current and most vivid examples showing how migrants are affected directly by the economic meltdown comes out of mexico .

while opposition supporters protest the election results that put president mahmoud ahmadinejad back in office , international news organizations say they are being prevented from reporting on the escalating events . german public broadcasters zdf and ard say their journalists are being prevented from doing their jobs , with the zdf team barred from reporting and ard correspondent peter mezger no longer allowed to leave his hotel .
the journalist told the bayrischer rundfunk television network that the situation had escalated after ahmadinejad accused foreign press of blowing the demonstrations out of proportion .
metzger said militiamen had taken the president 's words as a call to action and had clamped down on international media as a result .
he said a group of six men had appeared in the ard office in tehran armed with truncheons and electronic shock devices , and had taken one of his colleagues with them .
his whereabouts is still unkown .
in a letter to the iranian ambassador in berlin , the editors-in-chief of the two stations , said : “ we see a breach of freedom of the press and democratic principles . ”
they insisted , however , that they would continue to report in a “ critical , fair and independent ” manner .
electronic jamming the bbc has also reported difficulties .
it says the satellites it uses for its persian radio and television services have been affected by “ heavy electronic jamming ” which was becoming “ progressively worse . ”
technicians have traced the jam back to iran .
bildunterschrift : broadcasters want the freedom to report on what is happening director of the bbc world service , peter horrocks , said that any attempt to block its broadcasts was “ wrong and against international treaties on satellite communication . ”
he added that it appeared to be “ part of a pattern of behavior by the iranian authorities to limit the reporting of the aftermath of the disputed election . ”
the ap news agency said it had been told by government representatives not to deliver any footage to the bbc persian service , which is very popular in iran , or to voice of america .
whatever it takes a dutch television crew for public broadcaster nederland 2 said one of its journalists and cameramen had been arrested while filming outside the headquarters of ahmadinejad 's closest challenger , mir hossein mousavi .
“ they were pushed against a wall and their tapes were seized .
their filming permits were withdrawn and they had to leave the country immediately , ” nederland 2 said in a statement .
the arab news station al-arabiya was shut down for a week , while a spanish journalist also reported the confiscation of footage of some of the post-election protests .
press inside iran has shown very little sign of the ongoing unrest and an editor of the pro-mousavi newspaper kalemeh sabs said the authorities had forbidden the distribution of the paper on sunday .
deeply concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has called for clarity over iran elections meanwhile , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has expressed his concern about the mounting tension in tehran and has summoned the iranian ambassador .
in an interview with zdf television on sunday night , he said the accusations of election fraud had to be clarified " immediately and without delay . "
steinmeier also criticized the police violence towards pro-opposition demonstrators . " the actions of the iranian security forces are completely unacceptable , " he said , adding that berlin was watching teheran " with great concern .

the exhibition brings together leading aviation experts and business leaders from around the world .
but the mood of the air show is far from festive . the paris air show is held every two years at the le bourget airport just outside paris and is traditionally a place where contracts with airline manufacturers are inked .
but deals like the one announced monday by qatar airways for 24 airbus a320 jets are likely to be the exception at this year 's paris air show in light of the global economic recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar airways has ordered 24 airbus a320 aircraft european aircraft manufacturer airbus and american aviation company boeing are among the companies hardest hit by the global recession .
even if new orders come in , they wo n't necessarily mean a light at the end of the tunnel for either company .
many new purchases are offset by cancellations of previous deals made during the peak of an aviation industry boom , which occurred around the last paris air show two years ago .
delivery delays additionally , both companies are struggling to deliver on the large backlog of orders they still have .
the airbus a400m military transporter , which was originally scheduled for delivery at the beginning of this year , has seen major delays .
the future of the 20-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- project is at risk as some clients have threatened to cancel their orders .
boeing 's 787 dreamliner , a fuel-efficient , long-haul aircraft , has also seen its share of delays .
speculation that the dreamliner would make its first test flight at the paris air show has been put to rest by boeing representatives attending the event , who say the test flight is scheduled for the end of the month .
future of aviation industry unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boeing 787 ' dreamliner ' was unveiled in july 2007 , but is yet to be tested in the air statements from boeing and airbus executives reflect mixed expectations when it comes to the future of the airline industry .
scott carson , head of boeing 's commercial airplanes division , said he remained optimistic that the industry would bounce back by mid-2010 . airbus chief executive tom enders did n't go so far as to say he expected a turnaround inext year , but said that 2010 and 2011 would be critical years for the aviation sector .
on top of the grim financial future of the airline industry , many questions still surround the recent crash of an air france a330 airbus in the atlantic that claimed the lives of all 228 people on board .
the plane was scheduled to land in paris after taking off from rio de janeiro on june 1 .
despite that tragedy , and the dark clouds over the future of the airline industry , attendance at the paris air show does not appear to have suffered since 2007 .
around 2,000 exhibitors from over 40 countries are in attendance , and event organizers expect about 300,000 visitors throughout the week-long exhibition. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have today , with some european colleagues , already told iran to immediately make clear whether the election results announced can be taken seriously or not , " he said . steinmeier also said that he had summoned iran 's ambassador to the foreign ministry to discuss the " brutal actions " iran 's security forces have used against protesters . " we are looking towards tehran with great concern at the moment .
there are a lot of reports of electoral fraud . " said steinmeier in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster , ard . eu officials also expresssed their reservations about the results of the polling in tehran . " the presidency is concerned about alleged irregularities during the election and post-election violence that broke out immediately after the release of the official election results on 13 june 2009 , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " the presidency expects the new government of the islamic republic of iran will take its responsibility towards the international community and respect its international obligations , " it said , adding that the eu still hoped to resume dialogue with tehran over its disputed nuclear program . correspondents hampered in reporting efforts on sunday , the news division heads of german television networks zdf and ard filed a protest with the iranian ambassador about restrictions placed on their reporters . according to a joint letter sent by thomas baumann of ard and nikolaus brender of zdf , their correspondents were deliberately hampered in their ability to report the events from tehran . they specifically mentioned ard correspondent peter metzger , who was prevented from leaving his hotel room in tehran , and zdf reporter halim hosny along with his staff who had been forbidden to report details of the election . disputed results official results show that president ahmadinejad was re-elected with more than 62 percent of the vote .
defeated candidate mir hossein mousavi formally appealed against the result on sunday to the legislative body , the guardian council , a statement on his website said .
" today , i have submitted my official formal request to the council to cancel the election result , " mousavi said in the statement .
" i urge you iranian nation to continue your nationwide protests in a peaceful and legal way . "
mousavi urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against the " rigged " election , alleging widespread irregularities in the polls .
critics of the poll say many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mir hossein mousavi appealed to his supporters to reject violence mousavi also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign used to reach young , urban voters .
ahmadinejad defended his victory at a mass rally in tehran on sunday , saying the election was fair .
" some inside or outside iran have come out and said the elections have been distorted .
where is the distortion in the election ? "
" their -lrb- western -rrb- standpoint is if the candidate they propagated does not win , then there has definitely been cheating , " he said .
post-election violence protests against ahmadinejad 's landslide election victory turned violent on saturday as supporters of reformist presidential candidate , mir hossein mousavi , clashed with police in the iranian capital in the worst scenes of violence since the 1979 islamic revolution .
riot police patrolled the streets of tehran as thousands of opposition supporters took part in demonstrations in iran 's capital , defying police warnings .

in a joint statement , eu ministers agreed that " piracy off the coast of somalia is likely to remain a serious threat . "
the extension was made now because " early agreement on extending the operation would facilitate the necessary force generation . "
international navies have deployed dozens of warships around the gulf of aden over the past year in a attempt to curb attacks by pirates threatening the busy maritime trade route .
operation atalanta currently consists of 14 ships and three aircraft .
the german contribution consists of a total of 650 personnel , two warships , one supply ship and one reconnaissance plane .
the german frigate brandenburg left the port of wilhelmshaven on monday to relieve one of the vessels already in the gulf of aden .
the parliamentary mandate for german forces deployed on the mission expires at the end of 2009 .
it is not yet clear whether that mandate will be extended to allow for further involvement now that atalanta has been prolonged .
the eu mission , which draws on forces from germany , belgium , britain , france , italy , greece , the netherlands , spain and sweden , has been operational since december 2008 .
naval officers at the mission 's headquarters in northwood , london , say atalanta forces have arrested about 70 pirates so far .
they have also escorted 28 ships chartered by the world food program on aid delivery missions throughout the region. sje / ap / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are often the first ones to lose their jobs , face pay cuts and harder working conditions .
still , even the current crisis wo n't stop the trend toward migration . as the economic malaise deepens and shows no clear signs of abating anytime soon , many countries around the world are turning up the pressure on migrants in an effort to ease the strain on the local labor market .
japan , a nation with few migrant laborers to begin with , introduced a program that offers latin american guest workers of japanese ancestry cash incentives if they leave the country .
in europe , spain and the czech republic are also trying to persuade workers from outside the european union to go back home by paying them money to do so .
while japan 's program bars workers who participate from returning to the country , spain 's program allows migrants to come back after three years under the condition that they have a specific work contract . it 's a natural impulse that countries are looking at curbing the number of migrant workers in times of economic turmoil , says dietrich thraenhardt , a leading migration expert who is currently a fellow at the transatlantic academy in washington .
he clearly favors the spanish incentive model for migrants .
" i think it makes sense as long as migrants are free to chose .
some migrants may want to return home and if you take for instance the funding from spain back to romania you can live better there .
but other migrants will want to stay and as long as they can chose i think it 's a good policy , " he says .
but as jemini pandya , spokeswoman for the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- in geneva points out , the response to the spanish initiative has n't been dramatic .
most migrants think twice before they leave the country to which they came - often enduring considerable hardships on the way .
they know that once they go back to their home country , it will be hard to return again .
difficult data to ascertain in concrete terms how migrants are affected by the economic crisis is not easy .
many countries simply do n't have the tools to accurately document the flows of migrant workers and their financial situation in real-time , says pandya .
often it can take years until reliable data is gathered .
one of the best documented , current and most vivid examples showing how migrants are affected directly by the economic meltdown comes out of mexico .
according to the country 's central bank , the amount of money sent home by mexicans working abroad dropped by 19 percent in april of this year compared to the same month the previous year .
it was the steepest decline of so called remittances on record .
for mexico , which ranks third among countries receiving the highest remittances , the loss in revenue from abroad is significant .
the money sent home from mexicans working predominently in the united states amounted to roughly 25 billion dollars last year .
it is the country 's second largest source of income after oil exports . some experts deduct a historic reversal of the global migration trend from those numbers as well as from figures suggesting a drop in migration to the us and other countries and an increase in migrants leaving the us and other migration destinations .
however , the iom is more cautious .
spokeswoman jemini pandya argues that just because remittances are falling , it does n't necessarily mean that migrants have left the country , instead many may be simply sending less money home and trying to weather the crisis .
what 's more , says pandya , many people who are going back are planning to do so only for up to six months .
trend continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish migrant workers left britain to head home according to the iom there is no reversal of the global migration pattern .
instead , argues pandya , each country and region must be analysed individually .
in many cases , the economic crisis is n't the sole reason why migrants go back home .
" for example polish migrant workers to the uk and ireland have been returning to poland in large numbers , even actually before the financial crisis started , because the british economy had been deteriorating and the polish economy was stronger at the time and so they had already started to go back , " she says .
the same is true for brasilians leaving europe and for workers in the gulf states returning to india , pakistan and bangladesh , adds pandya .
even with the economic crisis , the iom does n't expect the total number of global migrants to drop and estimates that there will be between 210 and 214 million migrants by the end of next year .
dietrich thraenhardt also does n't predict a reversal of the long term trend toward migration , but notes that people might be inclined to be less mobile during the economic crisis .
" when the economy gets better again the migration will resume , because the structural imbalances between the poor southern world and the rich northern world with its problematic demography are still there and so the rich world needs labor from the poor world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trend toward international migration continues despite the crisis and when that happens , countries like britain , australia or malaysia , which have now scaled back the number of skilled and unskilled workers they let in , will have to ease their restrictions again .
because ultimately the fundamental labor shortages in these and many other countries can not be filled by domestic workers - even during an economic crisis , says jemini pandya : " migration never stops . "

benjamin netanyahu : ' no-one in israel wants war ' palestinians have rejected the israeli prime minister 's conditions for a two-state solution , saying he has " paralysed " the peace process .
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , in a major policy speech , accepted the creation of a palestinian state but only if it was demilitarised .
palestinian leader mahmoud abbas 's spokesman said his comments challenged palestinian , arab and us positions .
but the us said mr netanyahu 's stance was an " important step forward " .
in a landmark speech , weeks after us president barack obama urged him to agree a two-state plan , mr netanyahu said the palestinians must accept israel as a jewish state .
he said a palestinian state must have no army , no control of its air space and no way of smuggling in weapons .
the peace process has been moving at the speed of a tortoise .
tonight , netanyahu has flipped it over on its back saeb erekat , palestinian negotiator key excerpts of speech send us your comments his speech provoked anger among palestinian officials .
mr abbas 's spokesman nabil abu rdainah said : " netanyahu 's remarks have sabotaged all initiatives , paralysed all efforts being made and challenges the palestinian , arab and american positions , " reuters news agency reported .
palestinian negotiator saeb erekat said the speech " closed the door to permanent status negotiations " .
" we ask the world not to be fooled by his use of the term palestinian state because he qualified it .
" he declared jerusalem the capital of israel , said refugees would not be negotiated and that settlements would remain . "
tim franks , bbc news , jerusalem benjamin netanyahu has shifted .
he has used the word " state " , when it comes to palestinian self-rule .
in another deeper sense , though , there has been no shift .
mr netanyahu 's closest aides have been saying for months that they have two over-arching pre-conditions : a public palestinian acceptance of israel as the nation-state of the jewish people , and a complete demilitarisation of any future palestinian entity .
and mr netanyahu tersely dismissed the us call for an end to settlement expansion : these people have to live , he said .
he described them as " pioneers " and " principled " .
this is a speech which will shore up the prime minister 's position within his right-wing coalition .
it is , whatever you think of the rights and wrongs of it , a powerful forehand deep into the back court of the americans .
it will be fascinating to see when and how the americans return the ball .
mr erekat added : " the peace process has been moving at the speed of a tortoise .
tonight , netanyahu has flipped it over on its back . "
in gaza , hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri described the speech as " racist " and called on arab nations to " form stronger opposition " towards israel .
but the white house called the policy outline an " important step forward " , as did french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
a white house statement said mr obama " believes this solution can and must ensure both israel 's security and the fulfilment of the palestinians ' legitimate aspirations for a viable state , and he welcomes prime minister netanyahu 's endorsement of that goal " .
the bbc 's sarah morris in washington says mr netanyahu 's comments have provided a lot of encouragement to the white house , but it is uncertain whether they will be enough given the israeli prime minister 's refusal to budge on the issue of jewish settlements .
the statement made no mention of mr netanyahu 's demilitarisation caveat .
a potential stumbling block in any future peace deal - that of settlements - also went unmentioned in the statement , our correspondent adds .
' collision course ' in his own keynote middle east speech in cairo on 4 june , mr obama stressed that he wanted all settlement activity to stop .
but mr netanyahu said settlers were not " enemies of peace " and did not move from his position of backing " natural growth " in existing settlements .
former us president jimmy carter warned that the us and israeli governments would be on a " collision course " if israeli settlement activity continued in the west bank .
the settlers group yesha condemned mr netanyahu 's speech : " we deplore that the prime minister has agreed to the creation of a demilitarised palestinian state after he has said for years that such a state , even demilitarised , would be a threat to israel . "

benjamin netanyahu : ' no-one in israel wants war ' palestinians have rejected the israeli prime minister 's conditions for a two-state solution , saying he has " paralysed " the peace process .
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , in a major policy speech , accepted the creation of a palestinian state but only if it was demilitarised .
palestinian leader mahmoud abbas 's spokesman said his comments challenged palestinian , arab and us positions .
but the us said mr netanyahu 's stance was an " important step forward " .
in a landmark speech , weeks after us president barack obama urged him to agree a two-state plan , mr netanyahu said the palestinians must accept israel as a jewish state .
he said a palestinian state must have no army , no control of its air space and no way of smuggling in weapons .
the peace process has been moving at the speed of a tortoise .
tonight , netanyahu has flipped it over on its back saeb erekat , palestinian negotiator key excerpts of speech send us your comments his speech provoked anger among palestinian officials .
mr abbas 's spokesman nabil abu rdainah said : " netanyahu 's remarks have sabotaged all initiatives , paralysed all efforts being made and challenges the palestinian , arab and american positions , " reuters news agency reported .
palestinian negotiator saeb erekat said the speech " closed the door to permanent status negotiations " .
" we ask the world not to be fooled by his use of the term palestinian state because he qualified it .
" he declared jerusalem the capital of israel , said refugees would not be negotiated and that settlements would remain . "
tim franks , bbc news , jerusalem benjamin netanyahu has shifted .
he has used the word " state " , when it comes to palestinian self-rule .
in another deeper sense , though , there has been no shift .
mr netanyahu 's closest aides have been saying for months that they have two over-arching pre-conditions : a public palestinian acceptance of israel as the nation-state of the jewish people , and a complete demilitarisation of any future palestinian entity .
and mr netanyahu tersely dismissed the us call for an end to settlement expansion : these people have to live , he said .
he described them as " pioneers " and " principled " .
this is a speech which will shore up the prime minister 's position within his right-wing coalition .
it is , whatever you think of the rights and wrongs of it , a powerful forehand deep into the back court of the americans .
it will be fascinating to see when and how the americans return the ball .
mr erekat added : " the peace process has been moving at the speed of a tortoise .
tonight , netanyahu has flipped it over on its back . "
in gaza , hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri described the speech as " racist " and called on arab nations to " form stronger opposition " towards israel .
but the white house called the policy outline an " important step forward " , as did french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
a white house statement said mr obama " believes this solution can and must ensure both israel 's security and the fulfilment of the palestinians ' legitimate aspirations for a viable state , and he welcomes prime minister netanyahu 's endorsement of that goal " .
the bbc 's sarah morris in washington says mr netanyahu 's comments have provided a lot of encouragement to the white house , but it is uncertain whether they will be enough given the israeli prime minister 's refusal to budge on the issue of jewish settlements .
the statement made no mention of mr netanyahu 's demilitarisation caveat .
a potential stumbling block in any future peace deal - that of settlements - also went unmentioned in the statement , our correspondent adds .
' collision course ' in his own keynote middle east speech in cairo on 4 june , mr obama stressed that he wanted all settlement activity to stop .
but mr netanyahu said settlers were not " enemies of peace " and did not move from his position of backing " natural growth " in existing settlements .
former us president jimmy carter warned that the us and israeli governments would be on a " collision course " if israeli settlement activity continued in the west bank .
the settlers group yesha condemned mr netanyahu 's speech : " we deplore that the prime minister has agreed to the creation of a demilitarised palestinian state after he has said for years that such a state , even demilitarised , would be a threat to israel . "

benjamin netanyahu : ' no-one in israel wants war ' palestinians have rejected the israeli prime minister 's conditions for a two-state solution , saying he has " paralysed " the peace process .
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , in a major policy speech , accepted the creation of a palestinian state but only if it was demilitarised .
palestinian leader mahmoud abbas 's spokesman said his comments challenged palestinian , arab and us positions .
but the us said mr netanyahu 's stance was an " important step forward " .
in a landmark speech , weeks after us president barack obama urged him to agree a two-state plan , mr netanyahu said the palestinians must accept israel as a jewish state .
he said a palestinian state must have no army , no control of its air space and no way of smuggling in weapons .
the peace process has been moving at the speed of a tortoise .
tonight , netanyahu has flipped it over on its back saeb erekat , palestinian negotiator key excerpts of speech send us your comments his speech provoked anger among palestinian officials .
mr abbas 's spokesman nabil abu rdainah said : " netanyahu 's remarks have sabotaged all initiatives , paralysed all efforts being made and challenges the palestinian , arab and american positions , " reuters news agency reported .
palestinian negotiator saeb erekat said the speech " closed the door to permanent status negotiations " .
" we ask the world not to be fooled by his use of the term palestinian state because he qualified it .
" he declared jerusalem the capital of israel , said refugees would not be negotiated and that settlements would remain . "
tim franks , bbc news , jerusalem benjamin netanyahu has shifted .
he has used the word " state " , when it comes to palestinian self-rule .
in another deeper sense , though , there has been no shift .
mr netanyahu 's closest aides have been saying for months that they have two over-arching pre-conditions : a public palestinian acceptance of israel as the nation-state of the jewish people , and a complete demilitarisation of any future palestinian entity .
and mr netanyahu tersely dismissed the us call for an end to settlement expansion : these people have to live , he said .
he described them as " pioneers " and " principled " .
this is a speech which will shore up the prime minister 's position within his right-wing coalition .
it is , whatever you think of the rights and wrongs of it , a powerful forehand deep into the back court of the americans .
it will be fascinating to see when and how the americans return the ball .
mr erekat added : " the peace process has been moving at the speed of a tortoise .
tonight , netanyahu has flipped it over on its back . "
in gaza , hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri described the speech as " racist " and called on arab nations to " form stronger opposition " towards israel .
but the white house called the policy outline an " important step forward " , as did french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
a white house statement said mr obama " believes this solution can and must ensure both israel 's security and the fulfilment of the palestinians ' legitimate aspirations for a viable state , and he welcomes prime minister netanyahu 's endorsement of that goal " .
the bbc 's sarah morris in washington says mr netanyahu 's comments have provided a lot of encouragement to the white house , but it is uncertain whether they will be enough given the israeli prime minister 's refusal to budge on the issue of jewish settlements .
the statement made no mention of mr netanyahu 's demilitarisation caveat .
a potential stumbling block in any future peace deal - that of settlements - also went unmentioned in the statement , our correspondent adds .
' collision course ' in his own keynote middle east speech in cairo on 4 june , mr obama stressed that he wanted all settlement activity to stop .
but mr netanyahu said settlers were not " enemies of peace " and did not move from his position of backing " natural growth " in existing settlements .
former us president jimmy carter warned that the us and israeli governments would be on a " collision course " if israeli settlement activity continued in the west bank .
the settlers group yesha condemned mr netanyahu 's speech : " we deplore that the prime minister has agreed to the creation of a demilitarised palestinian state after he has said for years that such a state , even demilitarised , would be a threat to israel . "

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- palestinians dismiss israel plan bbc news / middle east graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 04:04 gmt , monday , 15 june 2009 05:04 uk palestinians dismiss israel plan palestinians have rejected the israeli prime minister 's conditions for a two-state solution , saying he has " paralysed " the peace process .
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , in a major policy speech , accepted the creation of a palestinian state but only if it was demilitarised .
palestinian leader mahmoud abbas 's spokesman said his comments challenged palestinian , arab and us positions .
but the us said mr netanyahu 's stance was an " important step forward " .
in a landmark speech , weeks after us president barack obama urged him to agree a two-state plan , mr netanyahu said the palestinians must accept israel as a jewish state .
he said a palestinian state must have no army , no control of its air space and no way of smuggling in weapons . "
the peace process has been moving at the speed of a tortoise .
tonight , netanyahu has flipped it over on its back " saeb erekat , palestinian negotiator key excerpts of speech send us your comments his speech provoked anger among palestinian officials .
mr abbas 's spokesman nabil abu rdainah said : " netanyahu 's remarks have sabotaged all initiatives , paralysed all efforts being made and challenges the palestinian , arab and american positions , " reuters news agency reported .
palestinian negotiator saeb erekat said the speech " closed the door to permanent status negotiations " .
" we ask the world not to be fooled by his use of the term palestinian state because he qualified it .
" he declared jerusalem the capital of israel , said refugees would not be negotiated and that settlements would remain . "
tim franks , bbc news , jerusalem benjamin netanyahu has shifted .
he has used the word " state " , when it comes to palestinian self-rule .
in another deeper sense , though , there has been no shift .
mr netanyahu 's closest aides have been saying for months that they have two over-arching pre-conditions : a public palestinian acceptance of israel as the nation-state of the jewish people , and a complete demilitarisation of any future palestinian entity .
and mr netanyahu tersely dismissed the us call for an end to settlement expansion : these people have to live , he said .
he described them as " pioneers " and " principled " .
this is a speech which will shore up the prime minister 's position within his right-wing coalition .
it is , whatever you think of the rights and wrongs of it , a powerful forehand deep into the back court of the americans .
it will be fascinating to see when and how the americans return the ball .
mr erekat added : " the peace process has been moving at the speed of a tortoise .
tonight , netanyahu has flipped it over on its back . "
in gaza , hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri described the speech as " racist " and called on arab nations to " form stronger opposition " towards israel .
but the white house called the policy outline an " important step forward " , as did french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
a white house statement said mr obama " believes this solution can and must ensure both israel 's security and the fulfilment of the palestinians ' legitimate aspirations for a viable state , and he welcomes prime minister netanyahu 's endorsement of that goal " .
the bbc 's sarah morris in washington says mr netanyahu 's comments have provided a lot of encouragement to the white house , but it is uncertain whether they will be enough given the israeli prime minister 's refusal to budge on the issue of jewish settlements .
the statement made no mention of mr netanyahu 's demilitarisation caveat .
a potential stumbling block in any future peace deal - that of settlements - also went unmentioned in the statement , our correspondent adds .
' collision course ' in his own keynote middle east speech in cairo on 4 june , mr obama stressed that he wanted all settlement activity to stop .
but mr netanyahu said settlers were not " enemies of peace " and did not move from his position of backing " natural growth " in existing settlements .
former us president jimmy carter warned that the us and israeli governments would be on a " collision course " if israeli settlement activity continued in the west bank .
the settlers group yesha condemned mr netanyahu 's speech : " we deplore that the prime minister has agreed to the creation of a demilitarised palestinian state after he has said for years that such a state , even demilitarised , would be a threat to israel . "

the assembly government 's plan also aims to cut the rates of sexually transmitted infections and highlight the dangers of unprotected sex .
a new health advisory board would be created along with better sex education guidance for schools .
the proposals , welcomed by sexual health organisations , now go out for consultation for 16 weeks .
recent figures showed teenage pregnancy figures were increasing in wales and remained higher than in england .
studies have also shown wales has a higher proportion of 15-year-olds who engage in sex than most other countries .
and a 2007 estyn report said only a minority of schools in wales taught sex education to a high standard .
pregnancy rates per 1,000 girls aged 13 to 15 in wales 2002 - 8.4 2003 - 8.1 2004 - 7.5 2005 - 7.9 2006 - 8.6 2007 - 8.5 launching the draft working paper sexual health and wellbeing for wales 2009-14 , health minister edwina hart said the assembly government was committed to reducing the rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections .
" a key component of this new document is the importance of educating people of the need for a greater awareness of good sexual health and the dangers associated with unprotected sex , " she said .
rates for pregnancy in teenagers up to 16 years old dipped to 7.5 per 1,000 girls aged 13 to 15 , five years ago .
but by 2007 the rate had risen once more to 8.5 .
better training features of the plan include the creation of a national sexual health advisory board , with representatives of young people and people living with hiv .
sex education guidelines for schools would be updated with better training for teachers .
a campaign would also be launched targeting further and higher education students to raise awareness of binge-drinking and unprotected sex .
the 16-week consultation period finishes on 5 october , 2009 .
sexual health organisation the terrence higgins trust cymru , which has service centres in cardiff , swansea and powys , said the plans are a " pragmatic response to one of the fastest growing serious health issues in wales " .
paul ward , deputy chief executive , said : " fully implementing this report gives wales the opportunity to really lead the uk in tackling hiv and sexual ill health .
" an effective hiv testing campaign could save the welsh assembly over a quarter of a million pounds for every infection prevented so investment in this area makes sound economic sense .
" good progress has been made in many areas but there 's still more to be done to improve detection of chlamydia and access to long-acting reversible contraception . "

a cast and crew of over 800 , plus 130 horses , are due to shoot a major battle scene at freshwater west .
although the beach remains open to the public there will be road closures with people living nearby issued passes .
last month the beach was used as a location for the final film in the harry potter series .
that saw a giant cottage made out of shells built on the sands with stars daniel radcliffe and emma watson taking part in the filming .
the robin hood film is being made by universal pictures and is directed by sir ridley scott .
the filming involves more than 800 people , including 450 extras , 250 crew , marshals and beach cleaners .
it will also include boats and 130 horses , which will be stabled temporarily nearby .
part of the film centres on the seaweed hut near the main car park .
permission to use the site has been granted by a number of organisations including the pembrokeshire coast national park authority , the national trust and pembrokeshire council .
a joint statement said : " we recognise that the filming will inevitably cause some disruption in the area as well as great public interest .
" we hope people will help us to accommodate the film companies and we hope that filming on this scale will bring numerous benefits to the local economy , both during filming and following through knock-on tourism spend .
" while it is difficult to quantify it is estimated in the region of £ 1m , including temporary employment , repeat visits by crews and cast , raising the profile of the area and use of local services - from food to vehicle hire , from laundry services to security . "
the park authority said filming would be mainly at the south end of the beach with one day 's filming at the seaweed hut .
it has also been told it will be part of the finale and include a battle scene with boats and horses .
the boats are being assembled in pembroke dock and temporarily moored off dale .
although the beach and coastal path remain open , marshals will ensure people do not wander into camera view .
there will also be marshals on water bikes to liaise with surfers .
the park authority said it had worked with universal pictures to protect the sand dunes and beach .
" the routes for access to the beach have been chosen carefully and fencing is in place to direct people , " it said .
" facility bases for the film crews have been selected outside of any sites of special scientific interest . "

the couple from bridgend won their case for damages after the mistake at cardiff 's university hospital of wales .
they were further angered when it emerged the other woman was given the morning after pill .
cardiff and vale nhs trust apologised " unreservedly " for the error and said it had improved checking procedures .
the trust admitted gross failures in care and has also agreed to pay an undisclosed settlement to the couple .
it has since emerged the clinic , ivf wales , had two near miss mix-ups in the previous year .
the couple , who have not been named , discovered the mix-up when they attended the clinic for the implantation of their last remaining viable embryo in december 2007 .
it later emerged that the patient who had been given their embryo had been given the morning after pill when the mistake was spotted almost immediately .
this resulted in the procedure being terminated . "
working conditions at the unit have since improved and we are continuously monitoring the safeguards and procedures we have put in place " ian lane , medical director cardiff and vale nhs trust " in less than 10 seconds our wonderful world was shattered when the senior embryologist stood in front of us and said , ' i 'm very sorry to tell you , but there 's been an accident in the lab .
your embryo has been destroyed ' , " the woman told the mail on sunday .
she added : " we were both rooted to our seats .
we were stunned and trembling .
we held each other tightly , and sobbed and sobbed . "
the woman , a 40-year-old hospital worker , said the couple rejected an offer for a free round of ivf treatment as they felt they could no longer trust the hospital .
the couple began fertility treatment in 2000 .
following the third cycle of treatment , the woman became pregnant and in april 2003 gave birth to a son .
the remaining embryos were frozen and , in line with the clinic 's policy , were kept for five years .
wrong shelf in november 2007 the clinic contacted the couple with the news that just one embryo had survived and was in good condition .
on 5 december 2007 , they attended the clinic for the embryo to be transplanted , unaware that in the laboratory a trainee embryologist had mixed up their embryo after taking it from the wrong shelf of the incubator .
the trainee failed to carry out " fail-safe " witnessing procedures to ensure the embryo being taken from the incubator and implanted belonged to the correct patient .
the mistake was only discovered when another colleague later found that the correct embryo , that belonging to the couple , was missing from the incubator .
an independent inquiry into failings at a leeds ivf unit in 2002 led to a series of recommendations being made to the hfea and all fertility clinics to safeguard against this type of incident in the future .
dr sammy lee , a fertility expert from university college london , said there were " good procedures " in place to prevent this kind of " disaster " , but the potential for human error would always exist .
' safeguards ' separate incubators for each embryos would help minimise the risk , he said , and some clinics were also introducing " ivf witness " - or electronic tagging .
" but you still have to remember someone has to put the chip on the dish , so what if someone puts the chip on the wrong dish ? " he added .
the hfea 's effectiveness to act as a watchdog has recently been questioned by the head of that inquiry , professor brian toft , following recent reports of ivf mistakes in london in february 2009 .
ian lane , medical director of cardiff and vale nhs trust , said : " we apologise unreservedly for this mistake .
" this was a rare but extremely upsetting incident for everyone involved and we take full responsibility for the distress caused to both couples and their families . "
mr lane said that immediately after the event , the trust carried out an internal investigation to find out exactly how it happened , and how it could be prevented from happening again .
the trust also notified the hfea , who carried out their own external investigation .
