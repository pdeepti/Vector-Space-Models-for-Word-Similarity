turkey says those arrested were suspected of having ties with kurdish separatists . news reports say eight protestors were hurt and a dozen others were arrested after clashes between kurdish protestors and turkish police .
the demonstrations were in response to last week 's arrest of kurdish officials with alleged ties to kurdish separatists .
clashes between masked youths and riot police broke out in the towns of hakkari and yuksekova , in southeastern turkey . two police officers are reported to be among the injured .
alleged ties to separatists last thursday , turkish police rounded up 31 people , including eight kurdish mayors , as part of its investigation into the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and its off-shoots .
earlier this month , the pro-kurdish democratic society party was banned from government for its alleged links to the pkk .
the pkk , which has been fighting an insurgency for kurdish independence since 1984 , is considered a terrorist organization by ankara and much of the international community .
the pkk 's fight with the turkish government has claimed roughly 45,000 lives .
kurdish protests have stepped up since october , first over the prison conditions of pkk founder abdullah ocalan , and more recently over the banning of the democratic society party .
turkey , in its bid to join the eu , has pledged reforms for the kurdish minority in the hope of easing tensions. mk / afp / ap editor : wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the scenes of violent bedlam return in 2010 ? iraq had once seemed condemned to a near-endless cycle of slaughter . at their most lethal the heavy years of the gun and the bomb were a brutal combination of terror attacks , internecine sectarian fighting , rampant criminal activity and combat with and military action by coalition forces that collectively , according to the british medical journal the lancet , may have caused between 600,000 to over a million , mostly civilian fatalities .
containing the killing seemed an improbable and daunting task .
trying to forge some sense of post-saddam national unity , cohesion , strength and viability as a nascent , newly democratic iraq , seemed as challenging and as unlikely .
as ever the devil is in the mix , the complex tapestry of iraq 's divisive , sectarian history and the tribal , multicultural , religious , ethnic and regional fault lines that underscore it , a reality the invasion had so poorly prepared for . but the success of the us-led military surge in curbing the epidemic spiral of violence , the steady buildup , confidence and capability of the reborn iraqi army and security forces , an ongoing entente between iraq 's shia and sunni arabs and the kurds and continued political power sharing , showed promise and progress .
the strengthening of a fragile democracy , and significantly where no such tradition had ever existed , the inability of the violence to overturn successive elections , even where they were marred , pointed the way to a better iraq .
can the violence be contained ?
if not an iraq free from violence , then at least an iraq more able to contain the violence , able to change and evolve its own political culture and once more able to focus on reconstruction , growth and stability and a sense of greater security wished for by the bulk of a war-exhausted population .
so can the bombings overturn all that has been gained and stands to be gained , is the fabric of the new iraq so frail still , that it may be torn apart yet again ?
has the terrorist hydra returned undiminished ?
according to a canberra-based islamic world and conflict specialist with over 10 years of experience working on iraq issues , who spoke exclusively to deutsche welle on condition of anonymity , the answer is quite succinct . " not necessarily , al qaeda is symptomatic , not systemic . "
so perhaps al qaeda is just stirring the pot , taking advantage of the political turmoil to try and provoke greater unrest by escalating violence .
political tension gives rise to more violence bildunterschrift : will sunnis and kurds one day march together to achieve change for their country ?
the political tension exacerbating the impact of the bombings revolves over a dispute between sunnis and kurds over the allocation of new parliamentary seats and the handling of the affair by prime minister nouri al-malaki 's shia-led administration .
as it stands now , sunni anger is growing and the newest round of elections set for the new year have been postponed until at least february .
it matters less how it came about and more so that the sunnis , who once ruled supreme , remain fearful and bitter over anything that smacks of their becoming a disenfranchised minority . the now dominant , majority shia and the largely autonomous small but powerful and well-organized kurds , both of whom suffered severely under saddam 's sunni-led baathist regime , are just as eager to secure their preeminence and regional sovereignty .
for the shia it means wielding the greatest power in leading iraq .
for the kurds to retain the quasi-federated status of their would-be statelet in northern iraq and a strong voice in national affairs and not least retention of their military and militia forces , home rule and control of the oil reserves within their sphere .
al qaeda split but still a force to be reckoned with and what is the state of al qaeda , how badly has it been hit , are the attacks indicative of its overall capabilities ?
and it must be remembered that it is not a monolithic and centralized organization , but rather a very diverse , often fractured group , whose strength and effectiveness can ebb and flow . and in iraq the face and shape of al qaeda has changed according to the conflict analyst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda in iraq may not be the force it once was but it remains a disruptive element " it has limited capacity , -lrb- it 's an -rrb- organization broken down into various groups that have lost much of their capacity to strike , including allegedly a syrian wing , iranian wing and an iraqi wing , with various splinters and groups or individuals for hire . "
so if al qaeda remains a pernicious presence in iraq 's internal affairs largely manipulated by outside forces , the greater threat to stability rests in keeping sectarian passions down to a manageable discussion , one that prefers the ballot box and heated political argument to disagreements with rocket launchers , bombs and kalashnikov rifles .
if sunni anger becomes a more open and widespread insurrection again , then the shia-dominated military and security forces will likely take on a more sectarian rather than national identity and certainly will be perceived as such .
as likely would follow the resurgence of shia militias , who remain largely organizationally intact .
watching such a scenario unfold , the kurds would attempt to seal themselves off , but would also face threats from growing arab nationalist sentiment in oil-rich areas where the kurds rule over an ethnically diverse population .
iran , turkey and syria will all be watching closely as well , regarding the de facto kurdish statelet as a potential instigator of kurdish uprising within their own borders .
iraqis hope for political stability the hope of the average men and women on the streets of iraq who simply long for peace and stability , is that al-maliki has to continue to show convincing leadership and deliver genuine security after the expected phased us withdrawal in 2010 through 2011 and fully be master of his own house .
part of the psychological success of the surge was to lower both the presence and profile of american troops largely confined to their bases and show the ground and security increasingly in iraqi hands .
and if the ongoing viability of an iraq fully in iraqi hands is the contingent prerequisite for a us military pullout , then that too may be under reconsideration in washington if the situation worsens . al-malakis soldiers , policemen and government may not be ready .
the reverse may also be true , the new iraq , though still facing test by fire , may well be ready to confront its demons on its own .
the events yet to unfold before the next election will tell us more .
what follows if iraqis alone can not fill the security vacuum left by an expected american withdrawal will further set the stage .
iraq itself , like its president , its government , its military and police , its society and institutions has to muster the strength of its convictions to uphold a national rather than a sectarian ideal .
that also may be too soon to call and the process remains fragile . author : chris kline editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the scenes of violent bedlam return in 2010 ? iraq had once seemed condemned to a near-endless cycle of slaughter . at their most lethal the heavy years of the gun and the bomb were a brutal combination of terror attacks , internecine sectarian fighting , rampant criminal activity and combat with and military action by coalition forces that collectively , according to the british medical journal the lancet , may have caused between 600,000 to over a million , mostly civilian fatalities .
containing the killing seemed an improbable and daunting task .
trying to forge some sense of post-saddam national unity , cohesion , strength and viability as a nascent , newly democratic iraq , seemed as challenging and as unlikely .
as ever the devil is in the mix , the complex tapestry of iraq 's divisive , sectarian history and the tribal , multicultural , religious , ethnic and regional fault lines that underscore it , a reality the invasion had so poorly prepared for . but the success of the us-led military surge in curbing the epidemic spiral of violence , the steady buildup , confidence and capability of the reborn iraqi army and security forces , an ongoing entente between iraq 's shia and sunni arabs and the kurds and continued political power sharing , showed promise and progress .
the strengthening of a fragile democracy , and significantly where no such tradition had ever existed , the inability of the violence to overturn successive elections , even where they were marred , pointed the way to a better iraq .
can the violence be contained ?
if not an iraq free from violence , then at least an iraq more able to contain the violence , able to change and evolve its own political culture and once more able to focus on reconstruction , growth and stability and a sense of greater security wished for by the bulk of a war-exhausted population .
so can the bombings overturn all that has been gained and stands to be gained , is the fabric of the new iraq so frail still , that it may be torn apart yet again ?
has the terrorist hydra returned undiminished ?
according to a canberra-based islamic world and conflict specialist with over 10 years of experience working on iraq issues , who spoke exclusively to deutsche welle on condition of anonymity , the answer is quite succinct . " not necessarily , al qaeda is symptomatic , not systemic . "
so perhaps al qaeda is just stirring the pot , taking advantage of the political turmoil to try and provoke greater unrest by escalating violence .
political tension gives rise to more violence bildunterschrift : will sunnis and kurds one day march together to achieve change for their country ?
the political tension exacerbating the impact of the bombings revolves over a dispute between sunnis and kurds over the allocation of new parliamentary seats and the handling of the affair by prime minister nouri al-malaki 's shia-led administration .
as it stands now , sunni anger is growing and the newest round of elections set for the new year have been postponed until at least february .
it matters less how it came about and more so that the sunnis , who once ruled supreme , remain fearful and bitter over anything that smacks of their becoming a disenfranchised minority . the now dominant , majority shia and the largely autonomous small but powerful and well-organized kurds , both of whom suffered severely under saddam 's sunni-led baathist regime , are just as eager to secure their preeminence and regional sovereignty .
for the shia it means wielding the greatest power in leading iraq .
for the kurds to retain the quasi-federated status of their would-be statelet in northern iraq and a strong voice in national affairs and not least retention of their military and militia forces , home rule and control of the oil reserves within their sphere .
al qaeda split but still a force to be reckoned with and what is the state of al qaeda , how badly has it been hit , are the attacks indicative of its overall capabilities ?
and it must be remembered that it is not a monolithic and centralized organization , but rather a very diverse , often fractured group , whose strength and effectiveness can ebb and flow . and in iraq the face and shape of al qaeda has changed according to the conflict analyst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda in iraq may not be the force it once was but it remains a disruptive element " it has limited capacity , -lrb- it 's an -rrb- organization broken down into various groups that have lost much of their capacity to strike , including allegedly a syrian wing , iranian wing and an iraqi wing , with various splinters and groups or individuals for hire . "
so if al qaeda remains a pernicious presence in iraq 's internal affairs largely manipulated by outside forces , the greater threat to stability rests in keeping sectarian passions down to a manageable discussion , one that prefers the ballot box and heated political argument to disagreements with rocket launchers , bombs and kalashnikov rifles .
if sunni anger becomes a more open and widespread insurrection again , then the shia-dominated military and security forces will likely take on a more sectarian rather than national identity and certainly will be perceived as such .
as likely would follow the resurgence of shia militias , who remain largely organizationally intact .
watching such a scenario unfold , the kurds would attempt to seal themselves off , but would also face threats from growing arab nationalist sentiment in oil-rich areas where the kurds rule over an ethnically diverse population .
iran , turkey and syria will all be watching closely as well , regarding the de facto kurdish statelet as a potential instigator of kurdish uprising within their own borders .
iraqis hope for political stability the hope of the average men and women on the streets of iraq who simply long for peace and stability , is that al-maliki has to continue to show convincing leadership and deliver genuine security after the expected phased us withdrawal in 2010 through 2011 and fully be master of his own house .

he proposes an independent ratings agency to alert users to these risks . germany 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information peter schaar has warned that many social networking sites still have n't totally gotten on board with protecting users ' data .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , schaar specifically mentioned facebook , the largest of such sites , and its recent changes to its privacy settings .

it can be difficult to encourage companies like facebook that are based outside of germany to change their policies , schaar said .
he added that cooperation at the international level will be necessary to combat the problem of lax data protection rules .
in particular , schaar suggested the establishment of an independent consumer protection agency that could evaluate social networks , giving them grades on their privacy policies and let user know which sites protected them the best .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : iraq : the rocky road to democracy and stability power struggles at heart of iraq impasse threaten fragile security experts fear integration of former insurgents threatens iraq 's security iraq 's elections will feature less us presence , but more concerns iraq oil auctions cause concerns over stability in gulf hierarchy iraq -pipe- 27.12.2009 iraq at a crossroads : a return to chaos or are better times ahead ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent carnage in iraq has raised fears that 2010 will continue in the same vein the spate of recent bombings in baghdad has evoked memories of the carnage that typified the worst of iraq ’ s insurgency at the height of the country ’ s civil war .
will the scenes of violent bedlam return in 2010 ? iraq had once seemed condemned to a near-endless cycle of slaughter . at their most lethal the heavy years of the gun and the bomb were a brutal combination of terror attacks , internecine sectarian fighting , rampant criminal activity and combat with and military action by coalition forces that collectively , according to the british medical journal the lancet , may have caused between 600,000 to over a million , mostly civilian fatalities .
containing the killing seemed an improbable and daunting task .
trying to forge some sense of post-saddam national unity , cohesion , strength and viability as a nascent , newly democratic iraq , seemed as challenging and as unlikely .
as ever the devil is in the mix , the complex tapestry of iraq 's divisive , sectarian history and the tribal , multicultural , religious , ethnic and regional fault lines that underscore it , a reality the invasion had so poorly prepared for . but the success of the us-led military surge in curbing the epidemic spiral of violence , the steady buildup , confidence and capability of the reborn iraqi army and security forces , an ongoing entente between iraq 's shia and sunni arabs and the kurds and continued political power sharing , showed promise and progress .
the strengthening of a fragile democracy , and significantly where no such tradition had ever existed , the inability of the violence to overturn successive elections , even where they were marred , pointed the way to a better iraq .
can the violence be contained ?
if not an iraq free from violence , then at least an iraq more able to contain the violence , able to change and evolve its own political culture and once more able to focus on reconstruction , growth and stability and a sense of greater security wished for by the bulk of a war-exhausted population .
so can the bombings overturn all that has been gained and stands to be gained , is the fabric of the new iraq so frail still , that it may be torn apart yet again ?
has the terrorist hydra returned undiminished ?
according to a canberra-based islamic world and conflict specialist with over 10 years of experience working on iraq issues , who spoke exclusively to deutsche welle on condition of anonymity , the answer is quite succinct . " not necessarily , al qaeda is symptomatic , not systemic . "
so perhaps al qaeda is just stirring the pot , taking advantage of the political turmoil to try and provoke greater unrest by escalating violence .
political tension gives rise to more violence bildunterschrift : will sunnis and kurds one day march together to achieve change for their country ?
the political tension exacerbating the impact of the bombings revolves over a dispute between sunnis and kurds over the allocation of new parliamentary seats and the handling of the affair by prime minister nouri al-malaki 's shia-led administration .
as it stands now , sunni anger is growing and the newest round of elections set for the new year have been postponed until at least february .
it matters less how it came about and more so that the sunnis , who once ruled supreme , remain fearful and bitter over anything that smacks of their becoming a disenfranchised minority . the now dominant , majority shia and the largely autonomous small but powerful and well-organized kurds , both of whom suffered severely under saddam 's sunni-led baathist regime , are just as eager to secure their preeminence and regional sovereignty .
for the shia it means wielding the greatest power in leading iraq .
for the kurds to retain the quasi-federated status of their would-be statelet in northern iraq and a strong voice in national affairs and not least retention of their military and militia forces , home rule and control of the oil reserves within their sphere .
al qaeda split but still a force to be reckoned with and what is the state of al qaeda , how badly has it been hit , are the attacks indicative of its overall capabilities ?
and it must be remembered that it is not a monolithic and centralized organization , but rather a very diverse , often fractured group , whose strength and effectiveness can ebb and flow . and in iraq the face and shape of al qaeda has changed according to the conflict analyst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda in iraq may not be the force it once was but it remains a disruptive element " it has limited capacity , -lrb- it 's an -rrb- organization broken down into various groups that have lost much of their capacity to strike , including allegedly a syrian wing , iranian wing and an iraqi wing , with various splinters and groups or individuals for hire . "
so if al qaeda remains a pernicious presence in iraq 's internal affairs largely manipulated by outside forces , the greater threat to stability rests in keeping sectarian passions down to a manageable discussion , one that prefers the ballot box and heated political argument to disagreements with rocket launchers , bombs and kalashnikov rifles .
if sunni anger becomes a more open and widespread insurrection again , then the shia-dominated military and security forces will likely take on a more sectarian rather than national identity and certainly will be perceived as such .
as likely would follow the resurgence of shia militias , who remain largely organizationally intact .
watching such a scenario unfold , the kurds would attempt to seal themselves off , but would also face threats from growing arab nationalist sentiment in oil-rich areas where the kurds rule over an ethnically diverse population .
iran , turkey and syria will all be watching closely as well , regarding the de facto kurdish statelet as a potential instigator of kurdish uprising within their own borders .
iraqis hope for political stability the hope of the average men and women on the streets of iraq who simply long for peace and stability , is that al-maliki has to continue to show convincing leadership and deliver genuine security after the expected phased us withdrawal in 2010 through 2011 and fully be master of his own house .
part of the psychological success of the surge was to lower both the presence and profile of american troops largely confined to their bases and show the ground and security increasingly in iraqi hands .
and if the ongoing viability of an iraq fully in iraqi hands is the contingent prerequisite for a us military pullout , then that too may be under reconsideration in washington if the situation worsens . al-malakis soldiers , policemen and government may not be ready .
the reverse may also be true , the new iraq , though still facing test by fire , may well be ready to confront its demons on its own .
the events yet to unfold before the next election will tell us more .
what follows if iraqis alone can not fill the security vacuum left by an expected american withdrawal will further set the stage .
iraq itself , like its president , its government , its military and police , its society and institutions has to muster the strength of its convictions to uphold a national rather than a sectarian ideal .
that also may be too soon to call and the process remains fragile . author : chris kline editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lasting peace in the war-ravaged country could only be achieved , he added , if moderate taliban members were allowed to participate in afghanistan 's democracy .
" because we are in a country with such regional diversity , " guttenberg told the paper , " we ca n't just leave out an entire ethnic group like the pashtuns if we want sustainable solutions for the future . "
certain conditions would need to be fulfilled , however , and it would be unacceptable for the afghan government to ignore universal human rights .
" we must ask ourselves who from the insurgents poses a serious threat to the international community and who is more concerned with the conditions in afghanistan itself , " he said .
" this issue of human rights must also be taken into account , without ignoring the existing cultures and traditions in afghanistan . "
guttenberg has in the past week indicated a willingness to engage in peace talks with non-terrorist taliban members , marking a change in german policy. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2009 somalia-based piracy remains an intractable problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have been a bane to western shipping companies it 's impossible to consider somalia 's pirates in a vacuum .
the evolution of piracy in somalia is inextricably linked to the collapse of somalia as a nation state , ravaged by conflict between rebels and government troops . the key pirate enclave is in northeastern somalia , in a region known as puntland where the pirates live as an autonomous presence .
among the five dominant seagoing criminal organizations based in somalia who generate revenues of between $ 100 to 150 million -lrb- 69 million to 104 million euros -rrb- a year , largely in ransom payments , many of the pirates were former clan fighters who discovered a far more lucrative form of armed capitalism .
others were mere humble fishermen who claim their livelihood has been lost to the industrial methods of international fishing fleets that indeed poach an estimated $ 300 million worth of fish a year from somali waters .
poverty , lack of development and hunger as ever are key factors for conflict , violence and brigandage in africa .
then there are the linkages to the outside world , the patrons , allies and benefactors , of what is a transnational business , so pirate arms come from yemen , much of the money is laundered in lebanon and there are other suspected but more opaque linkages in dubai .
however , the international community has not pierced the internal network linked to the pirate trail deeply and is lacking crucial access in terms of its intelligence gathering capacities within the secret structures that partner piracy .
limited military success against pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces managed to disrupt the pirates ' activities but their successes were few and far between where somalia 's pirates once confined themselves to the gulf of aden , they now launch raids and ship boarding as far away as the indian ocean on the kenyan coast .
there is un resolution 1838 in place authorizing lethal military force to curb or counter somalia 's pirates in international waters .
there is a multinational naval flotilla patrolling off the horn , combined task force 151 , that deploys warships , aircraft and naval special forces ship boarding parties , from european , us , and indian , russian and chinese contributors .
there have some successes scored by us and french special operations groups intercepting or eliminating pirates and freeing hostages and hijacked vessels , but with some 2000 miles -lrb- 3,218 km -rrb- of coast to secure , it amounts to a bathtub navy , although the squadron is a powerful one , that seldom can take a proactive approach or deter much .
but when the waterway under threat plays such a crucial strategic and mercantile role , and it is n't merely yachts that are captured or threatened but oil tankers , chemical ships , weapons bearing cargo ships and all manner of large civil vessels that are under threat , why have n't naval efforts been massively increased ?
moreover , when there are only an estimated 1,000 pirates concentrated mostly in a single coastal harbor town , why has n't the international community , as india has suggested , simply mounted a sharp amphibious assault ? to be sure there are some hawks and one former european military and intelligence officer who spoke to deusche welle anonymously said bluntly " what we need now is one short , sharp stroke and just take them out . " bildunterschrift : the un was often found lacking in its attempts to find a solution to the piracy issue the experience of the un peacekeeping mission and the ferocity of the fighting then and now , when somali violence reaches a crescendo , are cautiously remembered by many otherwise perhaps contemplating some sort of lethal strike , direct action in military terms against the pirates .
a combined sea , air and amphibious assault by marines and naval special forces comes to mind , but it would be a delicate and complex affair to orchestrate , plan and execute on a battleground that could draw in international forces into an unwanted quagmire or at least a costly battle .
the potential for large scale civilian casualties would further exacerbate the chance for a disaster .
political will lacking to back use of force and not least political will may be lacking among some of the potential partners for a concerted use of force , where consensus would be necessary .
in short , if a deeper military solution would be attempted to shut down somalia 's pirate problem , it must be on a unified front , on a greater scale than piecemeal efforts and with sufficient , overwhelming force and resources .
but again when so much key intelligence gathering is lacking , any potential decisive campaign against the pirates is hampered by a lack of actionable knowledge .
poor intelligence analysis led to earlier international fiascos in somalia and the question of piracy poses as vexing a question to resolve as all else that ails somalia and its larger , chronic state as a failed nation without the effective rule of law or much hope for far too long .
for the present some of the most dangerous waters in the world off the horn of africa , will remain as treacherous as ever in 2010 precisely because somalia is still a hungry , desperate and violent place .

" however , mutallab and other members of the family became worried when abdulmutallab said he was dropping his post-graduate program in business administration and was pursuing another course in yemen which he did not disclose . mutallab finally decided to tell authorities about his son when abdulmutallab sent a text message informing his family that he was severing all contact .

" abdulmutallab was overpowered by other passengers after they heard a pop and saw flames as the plane made its approach to land .
two passengers were injured and the suspect suffered serious burns .
airline officials described the explosives as resembling firecrackers . the fire was put out with blankets and fire extinguishers and the man was dragged to the front of the plane .

" we are in liaison with the us authorities and searches in london are being conducted as part of ongoing enquiries , " a police spokeswoman in the british capital said . the european commission said on saturday that it was investigating whether proper security measures had been followed at amsterdam 's schiphol airport , where the delta flight originated . " i am horrified by the attempted terrorist attack , " jacques barrot , vice president of the commission said in a statement .
" the european commission is in contact with the relevant authorities to make sure that all rules and procedures were followed in europe .
we are in touch with our dutch and us counterparts . " dutch counter-terrorism authorities said abdulmutallab transited at schiphol after arriving on a klm flight from lagos , nigeria .

lasting peace in the war-ravaged country could only be achieved , he added , if moderate taliban members were allowed to participate in afghanistan 's democracy .
" because we are in a country with such regional diversity , " guttenberg told the paper , " we ca n't just leave out an entire ethnic group like the pashtuns if we want sustainable solutions for the future . "
certain conditions would need to be fulfilled , however , and it would be unacceptable for the afghan government to ignore universal human rights .
" we must ask ourselves who from the insurgents poses a serious threat to the international community and who is more concerned with the conditions in afghanistan itself , " he said .
" this issue of human rights must also be taken into account , without ignoring the existing cultures and traditions in afghanistan . "

he proposes an independent ratings agency to alert users to these risks . germany 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information peter schaar has warned that many social networking sites still have n't totally gotten on board with protecting users ' data .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , schaar specifically mentioned facebook , the largest of such sites , and its recent changes to its privacy settings .

while users did have to accept the changes , schaar still considers this to be user protection " unfriendly . "

lasting peace in the war-ravaged country could only be achieved , he added , if moderate taliban members were allowed to participate in afghanistan 's democracy .
" because we are in a country with such regional diversity , " guttenberg told the paper , " we ca n't just leave out an entire ethnic group like the pashtuns if we want sustainable solutions for the future . "
certain conditions would need to be fulfilled , however , and it would be unacceptable for the afghan government to ignore universal human rights .
" we must ask ourselves who from the insurgents poses a serious threat to the international community and who is more concerned with the conditions in afghanistan itself , " he said .
" this issue of human rights must also be taken into account , without ignoring the existing cultures and traditions in afghanistan . "

prior to the trip , abdulmutallab had a good reputation among relatives as " a very religious , polite and studious fellow . " however , mutallab and other members of the family became worried when abdulmutallab said he was dropping his post-graduate program in business administration and was pursuing another course in yemen which he did not disclose . mutallab finally decided to tell authorities about his son when abdulmutallab sent a text message informing his family that he was severing all contact .

" abdulmutallab was overpowered by other passengers after they heard a pop and saw flames as the plane made its approach to land .
two passengers were injured and the suspect suffered serious burns .
airline officials described the explosives as resembling firecrackers . the fire was put out with blankets and fire extinguishers and the man was dragged to the front of the plane .
the northwest airlines flight , operated by delta , made a safe landing and all 278 passengers were escorted to safety . eu examines its end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam 's schiphol airport will need to review its security procedures the us has called on airlines and airports worldwide to implement tighter security measures , including frisks for all passengers headed to the us , and extra checks for carry-on luggage . authorities in london have been searching buildings where abdulmutallab was believed to have stayed while studying engineering there . " we are in liaison with the us authorities and searches in london are being conducted as part of ongoing enquiries , " a police spokeswoman in the british capital said . the european commission said on saturday that it was investigating whether proper security measures had been followed at amsterdam 's schiphol airport , where the delta flight originated . " i am horrified by the attempted terrorist attack , " jacques barrot , vice president of the commission said in a statement .
" the european commission is in contact with the relevant authorities to make sure that all rules and procedures were followed in europe .
we are in touch with our dutch and us counterparts . " dutch counter-terrorism authorities said abdulmutallab transited at schiphol after arriving on a klm flight from lagos , nigeria .

he proposes an independent ratings agency to alert users to these risks . germany 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information peter schaar has warned that many social networking sites still have n't totally gotten on board with protecting users ' data .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , schaar specifically mentioned facebook , the largest of such sites , and its recent changes to its privacy settings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar wants social networking sites to do more to protect users ' information the default of the new setup puts everyone at the weakest privacy level , making their personal information and uploaded photos public .
while users did have to accept the changes , schaar still considers this to be user protection " unfriendly . "
" you press ' next ' and then suddenly you 've made your information totally available without the original access restrictions , " he said .
privacy advocates in the us have filed complaints with the federal trade commission over the new changes and have called on facebook to restore the old settings .
independent evaluation schaar told dpa he 's not against social networks in general .
" what 's important to me , " he said , " is that people are aware of what they 're doing , what information they 're putting on the internet and the problems associated with certain activities . "
it can be difficult to encourage companies like facebook that are based outside of germany to change their policies , schaar said .
he added that cooperation at the international level will be necessary to combat the problem of lax data protection rules .
in particular , schaar suggested the establishment of an independent consumer protection agency that could evaluate social networks , giving them grades on their privacy policies and let user know which sites protected them the best .
such an agency was part of the coalition agreement between chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and their coalition partners the free democrats. hf / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he proposes an independent ratings agency to alert users to these risks . germany 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information peter schaar has warned that many social networking sites still have n't totally gotten on board with protecting users ' data .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , schaar specifically mentioned facebook , the largest of such sites , and its recent changes to its privacy settings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar wants social networking sites to do more to protect users ' information the default of the new setup puts everyone at the weakest privacy level , making their personal information and uploaded photos public .
while users did have to accept the changes , schaar still considers this to be user protection " unfriendly . "
" you press ' next ' and then suddenly you 've made your information totally available without the original access restrictions , " he said .
privacy advocates in the us have filed complaints with the federal trade commission over the new changes and have called on facebook to restore the old settings .
independent evaluation schaar told dpa he 's not against social networks in general .
" what 's important to me , " he said , " is that people are aware of what they 're doing , what information they 're putting on the internet and the problems associated with certain activities . "
it can be difficult to encourage companies like facebook that are based outside of germany to change their policies , schaar said .
he added that cooperation at the international level will be necessary to combat the problem of lax data protection rules .
in particular , schaar suggested the establishment of an independent consumer protection agency that could evaluate social networks , giving them grades on their privacy policies and let user know which sites protected them the best .
such an agency was part of the coalition agreement between chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and their coalition partners the free democrats. hf / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey says those arrested were suspected of having ties with kurdish separatists . news reports say eight protestors were hurt and a dozen others were arrested after clashes between kurdish protestors and turkish police .
the demonstrations were in response to last week 's arrest of kurdish officials with alleged ties to kurdish separatists .
clashes between masked youths and riot police broke out in the towns of hakkari and yuksekova , in southeastern turkey . two police officers are reported to be among the injured .
alleged ties to separatists last thursday , turkish police rounded up 31 people , including eight kurdish mayors , as part of its investigation into the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and its off-shoots .
earlier this month , the pro-kurdish democratic society party was banned from government for its alleged links to the pkk .
the pkk , which has been fighting an insurgency for kurdish independence since 1984 , is considered a terrorist organization by ankara and much of the international community .
the pkk 's fight with the turkish government has claimed roughly 45,000 lives .
kurdish protests have stepped up since october , first over the prison conditions of pkk founder abdullah ocalan , and more recently over the banning of the democratic society party .
turkey , in its bid to join the eu , has pledged reforms for the kurdish minority in the hope of easing tensions. mk / afp / ap editor : wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : iraq : the rocky road to democracy and stability power struggles at heart of iraq impasse threaten fragile security experts fear integration of former insurgents threatens iraq 's security iraq 's elections will feature less us presence , but more concerns iraq oil auctions cause concerns over stability in gulf hierarchy iraq -pipe- 27.12.2009 iraq at a crossroads : a return to chaos or are better times ahead ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent carnage in iraq has raised fears that 2010 will continue in the same vein the spate of recent bombings in baghdad has evoked memories of the carnage that typified the worst of iraq ’ s insurgency at the height of the country ’ s civil war .
will the scenes of violent bedlam return in 2010 ? iraq had once seemed condemned to a near-endless cycle of slaughter . at their most lethal the heavy years of the gun and the bomb were a brutal combination of terror attacks , internecine sectarian fighting , rampant criminal activity and combat with and military action by coalition forces that collectively , according to the british medical journal the lancet , may have caused between 600,000 to over a million , mostly civilian fatalities .
containing the killing seemed an improbable and daunting task .
trying to forge some sense of post-saddam national unity , cohesion , strength and viability as a nascent , newly democratic iraq , seemed as challenging and as unlikely .
as ever the devil is in the mix , the complex tapestry of iraq 's divisive , sectarian history and the tribal , multicultural , religious , ethnic and regional fault lines that underscore it , a reality the invasion had so poorly prepared for . but the success of the us-led military surge in curbing the epidemic spiral of violence , the steady buildup , confidence and capability of the reborn iraqi army and security forces , an ongoing entente between iraq 's shia and sunni arabs and the kurds and continued political power sharing , showed promise and progress .
the strengthening of a fragile democracy , and significantly where no such tradition had ever existed , the inability of the violence to overturn successive elections , even where they were marred , pointed the way to a better iraq .
can the violence be contained ?
if not an iraq free from violence , then at least an iraq more able to contain the violence , able to change and evolve its own political culture and once more able to focus on reconstruction , growth and stability and a sense of greater security wished for by the bulk of a war-exhausted population .
so can the bombings overturn all that has been gained and stands to be gained , is the fabric of the new iraq so frail still , that it may be torn apart yet again ?
has the terrorist hydra returned undiminished ?
according to a canberra-based islamic world and conflict specialist with over 10 years of experience working on iraq issues , who spoke exclusively to deutsche welle on condition of anonymity , the answer is quite succinct . " not necessarily , al qaeda is symptomatic , not systemic . "
so perhaps al qaeda is just stirring the pot , taking advantage of the political turmoil to try and provoke greater unrest by escalating violence .
political tension gives rise to more violence bildunterschrift : will sunnis and kurds one day march together to achieve change for their country ?
the political tension exacerbating the impact of the bombings revolves over a dispute between sunnis and kurds over the allocation of new parliamentary seats and the handling of the affair by prime minister nouri al-malaki 's shia-led administration .
as it stands now , sunni anger is growing and the newest round of elections set for the new year have been postponed until at least february .
it matters less how it came about and more so that the sunnis , who once ruled supreme , remain fearful and bitter over anything that smacks of their becoming a disenfranchised minority . the now dominant , majority shia and the largely autonomous small but powerful and well-organized kurds , both of whom suffered severely under saddam 's sunni-led baathist regime , are just as eager to secure their preeminence and regional sovereignty .
for the shia it means wielding the greatest power in leading iraq .
for the kurds to retain the quasi-federated status of their would-be statelet in northern iraq and a strong voice in national affairs and not least retention of their military and militia forces , home rule and control of the oil reserves within their sphere .
al qaeda split but still a force to be reckoned with and what is the state of al qaeda , how badly has it been hit , are the attacks indicative of its overall capabilities ?
and it must be remembered that it is not a monolithic and centralized organization , but rather a very diverse , often fractured group , whose strength and effectiveness can ebb and flow . and in iraq the face and shape of al qaeda has changed according to the conflict analyst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda in iraq may not be the force it once was but it remains a disruptive element " it has limited capacity , -lrb- it 's an -rrb- organization broken down into various groups that have lost much of their capacity to strike , including allegedly a syrian wing , iranian wing and an iraqi wing , with various splinters and groups or individuals for hire . "
so if al qaeda remains a pernicious presence in iraq 's internal affairs largely manipulated by outside forces , the greater threat to stability rests in keeping sectarian passions down to a manageable discussion , one that prefers the ballot box and heated political argument to disagreements with rocket launchers , bombs and kalashnikov rifles .
if sunni anger becomes a more open and widespread insurrection again , then the shia-dominated military and security forces will likely take on a more sectarian rather than national identity and certainly will be perceived as such .
as likely would follow the resurgence of shia militias , who remain largely organizationally intact .
watching such a scenario unfold , the kurds would attempt to seal themselves off , but would also face threats from growing arab nationalist sentiment in oil-rich areas where the kurds rule over an ethnically diverse population .
iran , turkey and syria will all be watching closely as well , regarding the de facto kurdish statelet as a potential instigator of kurdish uprising within their own borders .
iraqis hope for political stability the hope of the average men and women on the streets of iraq who simply long for peace and stability , is that al-maliki has to continue to show convincing leadership and deliver genuine security after the expected phased us withdrawal in 2010 through 2011 and fully be master of his own house .
part of the psychological success of the surge was to lower both the presence and profile of american troops largely confined to their bases and show the ground and security increasingly in iraqi hands .
and if the ongoing viability of an iraq fully in iraqi hands is the contingent prerequisite for a us military pullout , then that too may be under reconsideration in washington if the situation worsens . al-malakis soldiers , policemen and government may not be ready .
the reverse may also be true , the new iraq , though still facing test by fire , may well be ready to confront its demons on its own .
the events yet to unfold before the next election will tell us more .
what follows if iraqis alone can not fill the security vacuum left by an expected american withdrawal will further set the stage .
iraq itself , like its president , its government , its military and police , its society and institutions has to muster the strength of its convictions to uphold a national rather than a sectarian ideal .
that also may be too soon to call and the process remains fragile . author : chris kline editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 27.12.2009 bundesliga remains overshadowed by enke suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current season will always be remembered for the tragic suicide of robert enke the first half of the 2009/10 bundesliga season has been an eventful one , both on and off the pitch .
here we ask paul chapman , a regular independent soccer analyst for deutsche welle , his opinions on the season so far . dw : what were the best and worst games of the first half of the season in your opinion ?
paul chapman : one thing is virtually certain and that is that we wo n't see a crazier game this season than the one on december 12 which finished borussia moenchengladbach 5 hanover 3 .
what made the fixture amazing was that six of the goals were scored by hanover players .
three went into the borussia net and three into the hannover net .
so from hanover 's point of view at least , this must have been the worst game of the season so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's 4-1 victory in turin was a vintage performance the best for me has to be bayern munich 's qualification for the knockout stages of the champions league this season .
with bayern seemingly going out in the group stages , they managed by a combination of results to give themselves hope going into the final game .
it was clear enough : bayern munich , if they wanted to progress , had to go to turin and beat juventus .
after so much criticism from the fans and the media , bayern munich turned the clock back to treat us to a display equal to anything they 've ever produced in europe .
they beat juventus 4-1 with an outstanding performance and they provided us with a magnificent match featuring all that 's best in football .
what has been your biggest disappointment so far this season ?
vfl wolfsburg 's grafite is a shadow of the player who was the leading scorer last season .
the big brazilian has struggled to produce anything like his previous form and what is worrying is that not only have the goals dried up but also he seems short of pace and he 's robbed by defenders too easily .
the big striker still looks a mere shadow of the man who outscored everyone in the bundesliga last season and helped the wolves to the title .
what was the biggest surprise in the first half of the season , in your opinion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm 's outburst was a surprising break of character philipp lahm being disciplined by his club bayern munich for speaking out about what he saw as the club being run badly because lahm is not a player you would expect to speak out of turn .
however , at the time he spoke out , the state of things at bayern munich suggested he was right .
his comments seemed to suggest a big rift between the players and the new coach louis van gaal .
lahm was fined 25,000 euros by bayern and warned about his future behaviour and the matter was supposedly done and dusted .
lahm was n't dropped but his next two outings for bayern were probably the worst performances he 'd ever given for the club .
what was the least surprising thing you witnessed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a career of madness continues in lehmann 's 40th year jens lehmann still acting the fool !
you 'd think at the ripe old age of 40 , he would have put all his crazy stunts behind him and that he 'd now be a role model for others but sadly he never has been and obviously never will be .
take the recent game against mainz .
stuttgart were on course for a vital 1-0 victory , but after spending the majority of the game provoking the mainz players , lehmann capped an insane performance by deliberately stamped on the foot of mainz striker bance .
unfortunately for lehmann , the referee clearly saw the situation and did n't hesitate to send lehmann off and award mainz a penalty which was duly scored in the 90th minute and so the 1-0 victory that was in stuttgart 's hands was thrown away by lehmann 's moment of madness .
the first half of the 2009/10 season will always be remembered for the tragic death of robert enke .
what are your memories of robert enke and your feelings towards his death ?
i 've been reporting on german football for over 30 years now and two of the saddest stories in that period have involved the enke family .
first there was death of little lara and then the tragic suicide of robert .
enke was the star and the captain at hanover 96 .
he looked certain to be on the plane to south africa this coming summer with the world cup squad .
he had a supportive wife , a lovely home and several dogs which he 'd rescued from the streets .
he was quite simply a top sportsman and a very decent man .
the sad truth though is that he suffered from depression and had done for six years .
at times it had been worse than at others and certainly it must have been the lowest point of robert and wife teresa 's lives when their lovely two year old daughter lara died in september 2006 .
in march of that year , there had been genuine hope that lara might live and who will ever forget the joyous scenes after hannover beat cologne 1-0 in march 2006 at the awd arena and robert enke raced around the pitch after the match with his precious lara in his arms .

here we ask paul chapman , a regular independent soccer analyst for deutsche welle , his opinions on the season so far . dw : what were the best and worst games of the first half of the season in your opinion ?
paul chapman : one thing is virtually certain and that is that we wo n't see a crazier game this season than the one on december 12 which finished borussia moenchengladbach 5 hanover 3 .
what made the fixture amazing was that six of the goals were scored by hanover players .
three went into the borussia net and three into the hannover net .
so from hanover 's point of view at least , this must have been the worst game of the season so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's 4-1 victory in turin was a vintage performance the best for me has to be bayern munich 's qualification for the knockout stages of the champions league this season .
with bayern seemingly going out in the group stages , they managed by a combination of results to give themselves hope going into the final game .
it was clear enough : bayern munich , if they wanted to progress , had to go to turin and beat juventus .
after so much criticism from the fans and the media , bayern munich turned the clock back to treat us to a display equal to anything they 've ever produced in europe .
they beat juventus 4-1 with an outstanding performance and they provided us with a magnificent match featuring all that 's best in football .
what has been your biggest disappointment so far this season ?
vfl wolfsburg 's grafite is a shadow of the player who was the leading scorer last season .
the big brazilian has struggled to produce anything like his previous form and what is worrying is that not only have the goals dried up but also he seems short of pace and he 's robbed by defenders too easily .
the big striker still looks a mere shadow of the man who outscored everyone in the bundesliga last season and helped the wolves to the title .
what was the biggest surprise in the first half of the season , in your opinion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm 's outburst was a surprising break of character philipp lahm being disciplined by his club bayern munich for speaking out about what he saw as the club being run badly because lahm is not a player you would expect to speak out of turn .
however , at the time he spoke out , the state of things at bayern munich suggested he was right .
his comments seemed to suggest a big rift between the players and the new coach louis van gaal .
lahm was fined 25,000 euros by bayern and warned about his future behaviour and the matter was supposedly done and dusted .
lahm was n't dropped but his next two outings for bayern were probably the worst performances he 'd ever given for the club .
what was the least surprising thing you witnessed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a career of madness continues in lehmann 's 40th year jens lehmann still acting the fool !
you 'd think at the ripe old age of 40 , he would have put all his crazy stunts behind him and that he 'd now be a role model for others but sadly he never has been and obviously never will be .
take the recent game against mainz .
stuttgart were on course for a vital 1-0 victory , but after spending the majority of the game provoking the mainz players , lehmann capped an insane performance by deliberately stamped on the foot of mainz striker bance .
unfortunately for lehmann , the referee clearly saw the situation and did n't hesitate to send lehmann off and award mainz a penalty which was duly scored in the 90th minute and so the 1-0 victory that was in stuttgart 's hands was thrown away by lehmann 's moment of madness .
the first half of the 2009/10 season will always be remembered for the tragic death of robert enke .
what are your memories of robert enke and your feelings towards his death ?
i 've been reporting on german football for over 30 years now and two of the saddest stories in that period have involved the enke family .
first there was death of little lara and then the tragic suicide of robert .
enke was the star and the captain at hanover 96 .
he looked certain to be on the plane to south africa this coming summer with the world cup squad .
he had a supportive wife , a lovely home and several dogs which he 'd rescued from the streets .
he was quite simply a top sportsman and a very decent man .
the sad truth though is that he suffered from depression and had done for six years .
at times it had been worse than at others and certainly it must have been the lowest point of robert and wife teresa 's lives when their lovely two year old daughter lara died in september 2006 .
in march of that year , there had been genuine hope that lara might live and who will ever forget the joyous scenes after hannover beat cologne 1-0 in march 2006 at the awd arena and robert enke raced around the pitch after the match with his precious lara in his arms .
they were wonderful scenes and robert , a man who did n't smile too often , was positively beaming that day .
bildunterschrift : it was fear that eventually drove robert enke to suicide .
he was scared that if people discovered he suffered from depression , he 'd be driven out of football and he worried too that the authorities might take away the daughter which robert and teresa had adopted earlier in 2009 and he wanted so badly that they 'd be allowed to keep leila .
robert enke hid the secret that he suffered from depression but the illness tormented him and also his desire to be with his daughter lara again and sure enough he visited her grave before taking the fateful final steps of walking under a speeding train .
the grief and shock within german football was there for all to see and dfb president theo zwanziger hoped that it might bring everybody closer together but it has n't had any lasting affect .

here we ask paul chapman , a regular independent soccer analyst for deutsche welle , his opinions on the season so far . dw : what were the best and worst games of the first half of the season in your opinion ?
paul chapman : one thing is virtually certain and that is that we wo n't see a crazier game this season than the one on december 12 which finished borussia moenchengladbach 5 hanover 3 .
what made the fixture amazing was that six of the goals were scored by hanover players .
three went into the borussia net and three into the hannover net .
so from hanover 's point of view at least , this must have been the worst game of the season so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's 4-1 victory in turin was a vintage performance the best for me has to be bayern munich 's qualification for the knockout stages of the champions league this season .
with bayern seemingly going out in the group stages , they managed by a combination of results to give themselves hope going into the final game .
it was clear enough : bayern munich , if they wanted to progress , had to go to turin and beat juventus .
after so much criticism from the fans and the media , bayern munich turned the clock back to treat us to a display equal to anything they 've ever produced in europe .
they beat juventus 4-1 with an outstanding performance and they provided us with a magnificent match featuring all that 's best in football .
what has been your biggest disappointment so far this season ?
vfl wolfsburg 's grafite is a shadow of the player who was the leading scorer last season .
the big brazilian has struggled to produce anything like his previous form and what is worrying is that not only have the goals dried up but also he seems short of pace and he 's robbed by defenders too easily .
the big striker still looks a mere shadow of the man who outscored everyone in the bundesliga last season and helped the wolves to the title .
what was the biggest surprise in the first half of the season , in your opinion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm 's outburst was a surprising break of character philipp lahm being disciplined by his club bayern munich for speaking out about what he saw as the club being run badly because lahm is not a player you would expect to speak out of turn .
however , at the time he spoke out , the state of things at bayern munich suggested he was right .
his comments seemed to suggest a big rift between the players and the new coach louis van gaal .
lahm was fined 25,000 euros by bayern and warned about his future behaviour and the matter was supposedly done and dusted .
lahm was n't dropped but his next two outings for bayern were probably the worst performances he 'd ever given for the club .
what was the least surprising thing you witnessed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a career of madness continues in lehmann 's 40th year jens lehmann still acting the fool !
you 'd think at the ripe old age of 40 , he would have put all his crazy stunts behind him and that he 'd now be a role model for others but sadly he never has been and obviously never will be .
take the recent game against mainz .
stuttgart were on course for a vital 1-0 victory , but after spending the majority of the game provoking the mainz players , lehmann capped an insane performance by deliberately stamped on the foot of mainz striker bance .
unfortunately for lehmann , the referee clearly saw the situation and did n't hesitate to send lehmann off and award mainz a penalty which was duly scored in the 90th minute and so the 1-0 victory that was in stuttgart 's hands was thrown away by lehmann 's moment of madness .
the first half of the 2009/10 season will always be remembered for the tragic death of robert enke .
what are your memories of robert enke and your feelings towards his death ?
i 've been reporting on german football for over 30 years now and two of the saddest stories in that period have involved the enke family .
first there was death of little lara and then the tragic suicide of robert .
enke was the star and the captain at hanover 96 .
he looked certain to be on the plane to south africa this coming summer with the world cup squad .
he had a supportive wife , a lovely home and several dogs which he 'd rescued from the streets .
he was quite simply a top sportsman and a very decent man .
the sad truth though is that he suffered from depression and had done for six years .
at times it had been worse than at others and certainly it must have been the lowest point of robert and wife teresa 's lives when their lovely two year old daughter lara died in september 2006 .
in march of that year , there had been genuine hope that lara might live and who will ever forget the joyous scenes after hannover beat cologne 1-0 in march 2006 at the awd arena and robert enke raced around the pitch after the match with his precious lara in his arms .
they were wonderful scenes and robert , a man who did n't smile too often , was positively beaming that day .
bildunterschrift : it was fear that eventually drove robert enke to suicide .
he was scared that if people discovered he suffered from depression , he 'd be driven out of football and he worried too that the authorities might take away the daughter which robert and teresa had adopted earlier in 2009 and he wanted so badly that they 'd be allowed to keep leila .
robert enke hid the secret that he suffered from depression but the illness tormented him and also his desire to be with his daughter lara again and sure enough he visited her grave before taking the fateful final steps of walking under a speeding train .
the grief and shock within german football was there for all to see and dfb president theo zwanziger hoped that it might bring everybody closer together but it has n't had any lasting affect .
fan violence , bad sportsmanship and coaches losing their jobs are still the order of the day but the passing of robert enke did have an affect in that other people who suffer from depression have found it easier now to talk about their affliction .
robert enke will be remembered as a fine man and an outstanding goalkeeper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 27.12.2009 hopes of peace fade as another volatile year in the middle east ends 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands were shaken but a middle east peace remains elusive the year began in the middle east with war and ended without peace .
new leaders arrived with optimistic plans for a resolution to the israel-palestinian crisis but little was achieved by the year 's end . the year began for the middle east with conflict raging in the gaza strip .
israel 's three-week land , sea and air offensive which began on december 27 , 2008 continued as the year turned and finally came to an end on january 21 after some of the deadliest fighting in decades . reacting with overpowering force to years of palestinian rocket attacks on its southern territories , israel launched its war against hamas in the densely-populated strip as the world watched and the united states sat impotent , waiting for its new president to take office .
by the time president barack obama was sworn in , israel had retreated from gaza , its objective of smashing the hamas military structure complete but at the cost of 1,400 palestinian lives , many of them civilians . the war , from israel 's point of view , appeared to be a success .
the offensive all but stopped rocket attacks on israeli communities in the south , restricting hamas splinter groups to 275 rockets and mortar attacks since the war 's end , down from 3,300 in the year building up to it . however , while israel may have achieved increased security for its citizens in range of hamas rockets , the victory was to be exposed as a hollow one as the year went on .
any hopes of a lasting peace coming from the gaza war would be dashed , the international community would increasingly isolate israel , a un report by south africa 's richard goldstone would accuse both israel and hamas of war crimes and threaten to bring both sides before the international criminal court . hopes of peace increase with obama inaugeration international hopes for a lasting peace settlement between the israelis and palestinians rested on the stance the new administration in washington would take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitchell inspired optimism in some , lack of belief in others when president obama appointed george mitchell as washington 's envoy to the middle east , many were surprised by the us diplomat 's optimism regarding his new challenge .
mitchell , the broker of the 1998 good friday agreement which brought peace to northern ireland , raised hopes but also suspicions when he said : " i do n't underestimate the difficulty of this assignment . "
drawing on his experience of northern ireland , he added : " i formed the conviction that there is no such thing as a conflict that ca n't be ended . " " mitchell 's appointment was very much welcomed and seen as a good thing but at the same time it did n't mean that there was going to be a lot of progress in the peace process because there was still the division between hamas and fatah , meaning the us did n't have a strong partner on the palestinian side , " clara o 'donnell , a middle east expert at the center for european reform in london , told deutsche welle . " while there was caution not to expect mitchell to deliver straight away , there was a message coming from obama that he was sending an even-handed envoy with a clear track record in delivering peace from the outset which was a very positive thing . " obama confirms commitment in first tv speech the first indication of how president obama would personally tackle the middle east crisis came with his first interview on january 27 with the al arabiya channel . " obama was clearly showing that he wanted to send signals out to change perceptions about how the us viewed the world , how the us wanted to approach the arab world and he was very clear that he wanted to make a distinction between his administration and the previous one , " said o 'donnell .
" he was seen as showing intent , even-handedness and moving away from the past .

by the time president barack obama was sworn in , israel had retreated from gaza , its objective of smashing the hamas military structure complete but at the cost of 1,400 palestinian lives , many of them civilians . the war , from israel 's point of view , appeared to be a success .

new leaders arrived with optimistic plans for a resolution to the israel-palestinian crisis but little was achieved by the year 's end . the year began for the middle east with conflict raging in the gaza strip .
israel 's three-week land , sea and air offensive which began on december 27 , 2008 continued as the year turned and finally came to an end on january 21 after some of the deadliest fighting in decades . reacting with overpowering force to years of palestinian rocket attacks on its southern territories , israel launched its war against hamas in the densely-populated strip as the world watched and the united states sat impotent , waiting for its new president to take office .
by the time president barack obama was sworn in , israel had retreated from gaza , its objective of smashing the hamas military structure complete but at the cost of 1,400 palestinian lives , many of them civilians . the war , from israel 's point of view , appeared to be a success .
the offensive all but stopped rocket attacks on israeli communities in the south , restricting hamas splinter groups to 275 rockets and mortar attacks since the war 's end , down from 3,300 in the year building up to it . however , while israel may have achieved increased security for its citizens in range of hamas rockets , the victory was to be exposed as a hollow one as the year went on .
any hopes of a lasting peace coming from the gaza war would be dashed , the international community would increasingly isolate israel , a un report by south africa 's richard goldstone would accuse both israel and hamas of war crimes and threaten to bring both sides before the international criminal court . hopes of peace increase with obama inaugeration international hopes for a lasting peace settlement between the israelis and palestinians rested on the stance the new administration in washington would take . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitchell inspired optimism in some , lack of belief in others when president obama appointed george mitchell as washington 's envoy to the middle east , many were surprised by the us diplomat 's optimism regarding his new challenge .
mitchell , the broker of the 1998 good friday agreement which brought peace to northern ireland , raised hopes but also suspicions when he said : " i do n't underestimate the difficulty of this assignment . "
drawing on his experience of northern ireland , he added : " i formed the conviction that there is no such thing as a conflict that ca n't be ended . " " mitchell 's appointment was very much welcomed and seen as a good thing but at the same time it did n't mean that there was going to be a lot of progress in the peace process because there was still the division between hamas and fatah , meaning the us did n't have a strong partner on the palestinian side , " clara o 'donnell , a middle east expert at the center for european reform in london , told deutsche welle . " while there was caution not to expect mitchell to deliver straight away , there was a message coming from obama that he was sending an even-handed envoy with a clear track record in delivering peace from the outset which was a very positive thing . " obama confirms commitment in first tv speech the first indication of how president obama would personally tackle the middle east crisis came with his first interview on january 27 with the al arabiya channel . " obama was clearly showing that he wanted to send signals out to change perceptions about how the us viewed the world , how the us wanted to approach the arab world and he was very clear that he wanted to make a distinction between his administration and the previous one , " said o 'donnell .
" he was seen as showing intent , even-handedness and moving away from the past .
but unfortunately , as time would tell , he was dealing with a very difficult set of partners and as a result , the administration promised much but delivered very little . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama chose al arabiya for his first tv interview as president " obama made it very clear that the middle east conflict would be a very important part of his presidency and although he said that a resolution of the israeli-palestinian situation would be sought in his second term , he showed a great commitment from the start to get involved and start laying down the groundwork for a resolution , " sawsan chebli , a middle east expert with the german council for foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , told deutsche welle . obama would again address the wider middle east and the israeli-palestinian conflict within this context when he gave a speech at cairo university in june . read more on the elusive quest for peace in the middle east 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obama showed continuity between his first interview and the cairo speech but the cairo speech contained strong language , language we ’ re not accustomed to hearing from a us president , " said o 'donnell .
" he said it was essential that israel stopped settlement building ; he highlighted the unbearable plight of the palestinians and the need to recognize the palestinian state .
what 's key here is the context : that this came at the time of a new hard-line government in israel and yet obama was coming out and showing where he stood on these issues . " netanyahu 's election win complicates situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu and his likud party pulled israel to the right between obama 's inauguration and his speech in cairo , israel had taken a radical swing to the right .
many observers believed that the election victory for benjamin netanyahu of the hard-line likud party was a direct reaction to the rise of hamas , the continued threat of rocket attacks from gaza and the increasing anti-israel rhetoric from a belligerent , nuclear ambitious iran . " even when he was the opposition leader it was very obvious that netanyahu would be a tough person to deal with , " said chebli . " he was very strong and committed to the settlement issue and made it very clear that no one , not even the united states , was going to influence israel 's policy on this .
once netanyahu got into power , the situation on the ground for the obama administration became even more difficult . " palestinians lay down demands for peace with a right-wing hardliner now in power in israel , the palestinians made concrete demands on the new netanyahu government .
before peace talks could resume , president mahmoud abbas demanded that israel should endorse a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , stop all israeli construction in the occupied west bank , and pick up peace talks from where they left off with the previous , centrist israeli government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas made clear the palestinian conditions for peace " the palestinians made it very clear that they would not enter into peace talks with the israelis before israel put a stop to the settlements , " said chebli . " the fact that the israelis would not put a complete stop to the settlements and not remove those already built showed the palestinians how committed the israelis were to a real peace . " then netanyahu made a surprise move in november by imposing a ban on the building of new settlements in the west bank for 10 months .
it was the most far-reaching moratorium ever decreed by an israeli government and it caused outrage among israeli right-wingers . but despite this , netanyahu 's ban on construction fell far short of the full freeze demanded by the palestinians .
the ban did not include settlement building in jerusalem or the continuance of construction of public buildings , as well as a few thousand residential ones , whose construction had already begun in the west bank . the white house had made it clear that it wanted a halt to all settlement building .
" with respect to settlements , the president was very clear when prime minister netanyahu was here .
he wants to see a stop to settlements - not some settlements , not outposts , not natural growth exceptions , " said secretary of state hillary rodham clinton in may .
" we intend to press that point . " us waters down language , angers arab world but in november , the united states was forced to acknowledge that the netanyahu moratorium fell " far short " of its position , but still praised it as " unprecedented " and tried to convince the embattled and bitterly disappointed abbas to drop his preconditions for opening negotiations . " what really shocked the wider middle east and the palestinians was when hillary clinton began to urge abbas to back down on his demands over settlements in a bid to get peace talks restarted , " chebli said . " abbas , of course , refused and so the stalemate resumed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the settlement issue has created problems for the us the apparent inability of the obama administration to get israel to agree to its first condition for resuming peace talks angered the arab world and heaped more pressure on a us president who had promised much when he first came to office . " obama is in a very difficult position now that the us position has shifted to one of calling on israel for restraint rather than pushing for the complete ban on settlements , " chebli said . " obama is now struggling because it is clear that he can not put any pressure on israel .
netanyahu is not going to budge and in fact , obama has failed in his first attempt to get israel to agree to anything , which was the settlement freeze . " the arab world is therefore very disappointed with obama because the arabs really thought that this president would be able to put pressure on israel , not only on the settlement issue but in the wider context of finding a solution to the middle east conflict , " she concluded . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what 's key here is the context : that this came at the time of a new hard-line government in israel and yet obama was coming out and showing where he stood on these issues . " netanyahu 's election win complicates situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu and his likud party pulled israel to the right between obama 's inauguration and his speech in cairo , israel had taken a radical swing to the right .
many observers believed that the election victory for benjamin netanyahu of the hard-line likud party was a direct reaction to the rise of hamas , the continued threat of rocket attacks from gaza and the increasing anti-israel rhetoric from a belligerent , nuclear ambitious iran . " even when he was the opposition leader it was very obvious that netanyahu would be a tough person to deal with , " said chebli . " he was very strong and committed to the settlement issue and made it very clear that no one , not even the united states , was going to influence israel 's policy on this .
once netanyahu got into power , the situation on the ground for the obama administration became even more difficult . " palestinians lay down demands for peace with a right-wing hardliner now in power in israel , the palestinians made concrete demands on the new netanyahu government .
before peace talks could resume , president mahmoud abbas demanded that israel should endorse a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , stop all israeli construction in the occupied west bank , and pick up peace talks from where they left off with the previous , centrist israeli government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas made clear the palestinian conditions for peace " the palestinians made it very clear that they would not enter into peace talks with the israelis before israel put a stop to the settlements , " said chebli . " the fact that the israelis would not put a complete stop to the settlements and not remove those already built showed the palestinians how committed the israelis were to a real peace . " then netanyahu made a surprise move in november by imposing a ban on the building of new settlements in the west bank for 10 months .
it was the most far-reaching moratorium ever decreed by an israeli government and it caused outrage among israeli right-wingers . but despite this , netanyahu 's ban on construction fell far short of the full freeze demanded by the palestinians .
the ban did not include settlement building in jerusalem or the continuance of construction of public buildings , as well as a few thousand residential ones , whose construction had already begun in the west bank . the white house had made it clear that it wanted a halt to all settlement building .
" with respect to settlements , the president was very clear when prime minister netanyahu was here .
he wants to see a stop to settlements - not some settlements , not outposts , not natural growth exceptions , " said secretary of state hillary rodham clinton in may .
" we intend to press that point . " us waters down language , angers arab world but in november , the united states was forced to acknowledge that the netanyahu moratorium fell " far short " of its position , but still praised it as " unprecedented " and tried to convince the embattled and bitterly disappointed abbas to drop his preconditions for opening negotiations . " what really shocked the wider middle east and the palestinians was when hillary clinton began to urge abbas to back down on his demands over settlements in a bid to get peace talks restarted , " chebli said . " abbas , of course , refused and so the stalemate resumed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the settlement issue has created problems for the us the apparent inability of the obama administration to get israel to agree to its first condition for resuming peace talks angered the arab world and heaped more pressure on a us president who had promised much when he first came to office . " obama is in a very difficult position now that the us position has shifted to one of calling on israel for restraint rather than pushing for the complete ban on settlements , " chebli said . " obama is now struggling because it is clear that he can not put any pressure on israel .
netanyahu is not going to budge and in fact , obama has failed in his first attempt to get israel to agree to anything , which was the settlement freeze . " the arab world is therefore very disappointed with obama because the arabs really thought that this president would be able to put pressure on israel , not only on the settlement issue but in the wider context of finding a solution to the middle east conflict , " she concluded . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the scenes of violent bedlam return in 2010 ? iraq had once seemed condemned to a near-endless cycle of slaughter . at their most lethal the heavy years of the gun and the bomb were a brutal combination of terror attacks , internecine sectarian fighting , rampant criminal activity and combat with and military action by coalition forces that collectively , according to the british medical journal the lancet , may have caused between 600,000 to over a million , mostly civilian fatalities .
containing the killing seemed an improbable and daunting task .
trying to forge some sense of post-saddam national unity , cohesion , strength and viability as a nascent , newly democratic iraq , seemed as challenging and as unlikely .
as ever the devil is in the mix , the complex tapestry of iraq 's divisive , sectarian history and the tribal , multicultural , religious , ethnic and regional fault lines that underscore it , a reality the invasion had so poorly prepared for . but the success of the us-led military surge in curbing the epidemic spiral of violence , the steady buildup , confidence and capability of the reborn iraqi army and security forces , an ongoing entente between iraq 's shia and sunni arabs and the kurds and continued political power sharing , showed promise and progress .
the strengthening of a fragile democracy , and significantly where no such tradition had ever existed , the inability of the violence to overturn successive elections , even where they were marred , pointed the way to a better iraq .
can the violence be contained ?
if not an iraq free from violence , then at least an iraq more able to contain the violence , able to change and evolve its own political culture and once more able to focus on reconstruction , growth and stability and a sense of greater security wished for by the bulk of a war-exhausted population .
so can the bombings overturn all that has been gained and stands to be gained , is the fabric of the new iraq so frail still , that it may be torn apart yet again ?
has the terrorist hydra returned undiminished ?
according to a canberra-based islamic world and conflict specialist with over 10 years of experience working on iraq issues , who spoke exclusively to deutsche welle on condition of anonymity , the answer is quite succinct . " not necessarily , al qaeda is symptomatic , not systemic . "
so perhaps al qaeda is just stirring the pot , taking advantage of the political turmoil to try and provoke greater unrest by escalating violence .
political tension gives rise to more violence bildunterschrift : will sunnis and kurds one day march together to achieve change for their country ?
the political tension exacerbating the impact of the bombings revolves over a dispute between sunnis and kurds over the allocation of new parliamentary seats and the handling of the affair by prime minister nouri al-malaki 's shia-led administration .
as it stands now , sunni anger is growing and the newest round of elections set for the new year have been postponed until at least february .
it matters less how it came about and more so that the sunnis , who once ruled supreme , remain fearful and bitter over anything that smacks of their becoming a disenfranchised minority . the now dominant , majority shia and the largely autonomous small but powerful and well-organized kurds , both of whom suffered severely under saddam 's sunni-led baathist regime , are just as eager to secure their preeminence and regional sovereignty .
for the shia it means wielding the greatest power in leading iraq .
for the kurds to retain the quasi-federated status of their would-be statelet in northern iraq and a strong voice in national affairs and not least retention of their military and militia forces , home rule and control of the oil reserves within their sphere .
al qaeda split but still a force to be reckoned with and what is the state of al qaeda , how badly has it been hit , are the attacks indicative of its overall capabilities ?
and it must be remembered that it is not a monolithic and centralized organization , but rather a very diverse , often fractured group , whose strength and effectiveness can ebb and flow . and in iraq the face and shape of al qaeda has changed according to the conflict analyst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda in iraq may not be the force it once was but it remains a disruptive element " it has limited capacity , -lrb- it 's an -rrb- organization broken down into various groups that have lost much of their capacity to strike , including allegedly a syrian wing , iranian wing and an iraqi wing , with various splinters and groups or individuals for hire . "
so if al qaeda remains a pernicious presence in iraq 's internal affairs largely manipulated by outside forces , the greater threat to stability rests in keeping sectarian passions down to a manageable discussion , one that prefers the ballot box and heated political argument to disagreements with rocket launchers , bombs and kalashnikov rifles .
if sunni anger becomes a more open and widespread insurrection again , then the shia-dominated military and security forces will likely take on a more sectarian rather than national identity and certainly will be perceived as such .
as likely would follow the resurgence of shia militias , who remain largely organizationally intact .
watching such a scenario unfold , the kurds would attempt to seal themselves off , but would also face threats from growing arab nationalist sentiment in oil-rich areas where the kurds rule over an ethnically diverse population .
iran , turkey and syria will all be watching closely as well , regarding the de facto kurdish statelet as a potential instigator of kurdish uprising within their own borders .
iraqis hope for political stability the hope of the average men and women on the streets of iraq who simply long for peace and stability , is that al-maliki has to continue to show convincing leadership and deliver genuine security after the expected phased us withdrawal in 2010 through 2011 and fully be master of his own house .
part of the psychological success of the surge was to lower both the presence and profile of american troops largely confined to their bases and show the ground and security increasingly in iraqi hands .
and if the ongoing viability of an iraq fully in iraqi hands is the contingent prerequisite for a us military pullout , then that too may be under reconsideration in washington if the situation worsens . al-malakis soldiers , policemen and government may not be ready .
the reverse may also be true , the new iraq , though still facing test by fire , may well be ready to confront its demons on its own .
the events yet to unfold before the next election will tell us more .
what follows if iraqis alone can not fill the security vacuum left by an expected american withdrawal will further set the stage .
iraq itself , like its president , its government , its military and police , its society and institutions has to muster the strength of its convictions to uphold a national rather than a sectarian ideal .
that also may be too soon to call and the process remains fragile . author : chris kline editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the kurds to retain the quasi-federated status of their would-be statelet in northern iraq and a strong voice in national affairs and not least retention of their military and militia forces , home rule and control of the oil reserves within their sphere .
al qaeda split but still a force to be reckoned with and what is the state of al qaeda , how badly has it been hit , are the attacks indicative of its overall capabilities ?
and it must be remembered that it is not a monolithic and centralized organization , but rather a very diverse , often fractured group , whose strength and effectiveness can ebb and flow . and in iraq the face and shape of al qaeda has changed according to the conflict analyst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda in iraq may not be the force it once was but it remains a disruptive element " it has limited capacity , -lrb- it 's an -rrb- organization broken down into various groups that have lost much of their capacity to strike , including allegedly a syrian wing , iranian wing and an iraqi wing , with various splinters and groups or individuals for hire . "
so if al qaeda remains a pernicious presence in iraq 's internal affairs largely manipulated by outside forces , the greater threat to stability rests in keeping sectarian passions down to a manageable discussion , one that prefers the ballot box and heated political argument to disagreements with rocket launchers , bombs and kalashnikov rifles .
if sunni anger becomes a more open and widespread insurrection again , then the shia-dominated military and security forces will likely take on a more sectarian rather than national identity and certainly will be perceived as such .
as likely would follow the resurgence of shia militias , who remain largely organizationally intact .
watching such a scenario unfold , the kurds would attempt to seal themselves off , but would also face threats from growing arab nationalist sentiment in oil-rich areas where the kurds rule over an ethnically diverse population .
iran , turkey and syria will all be watching closely as well , regarding the de facto kurdish statelet as a potential instigator of kurdish uprising within their own borders .
iraqis hope for political stability the hope of the average men and women on the streets of iraq who simply long for peace and stability , is that al-maliki has to continue to show convincing leadership and deliver genuine security after the expected phased us withdrawal in 2010 through 2011 and fully be master of his own house .
part of the psychological success of the surge was to lower both the presence and profile of american troops largely confined to their bases and show the ground and security increasingly in iraqi hands .
and if the ongoing viability of an iraq fully in iraqi hands is the contingent prerequisite for a us military pullout , then that too may be under reconsideration in washington if the situation worsens . al-malakis soldiers , policemen and government may not be ready .
the reverse may also be true , the new iraq , though still facing test by fire , may well be ready to confront its demons on its own .
the events yet to unfold before the next election will tell us more .
what follows if iraqis alone can not fill the security vacuum left by an expected american withdrawal will further set the stage .
iraq itself , like its president , its government , its military and police , its society and institutions has to muster the strength of its convictions to uphold a national rather than a sectarian ideal .

will the scenes of violent bedlam return in 2010 ? iraq had once seemed condemned to a near-endless cycle of slaughter . at their most lethal the heavy years of the gun and the bomb were a brutal combination of terror attacks , internecine sectarian fighting , rampant criminal activity and combat with and military action by coalition forces that collectively , according to the british medical journal the lancet , may have caused between 600,000 to over a million , mostly civilian fatalities .
containing the killing seemed an improbable and daunting task .
trying to forge some sense of post-saddam national unity , cohesion , strength and viability as a nascent , newly democratic iraq , seemed as challenging and as unlikely .
as ever the devil is in the mix , the complex tapestry of iraq 's divisive , sectarian history and the tribal , multicultural , religious , ethnic and regional fault lines that underscore it , a reality the invasion had so poorly prepared for . but the success of the us-led military surge in curbing the epidemic spiral of violence , the steady buildup , confidence and capability of the reborn iraqi army and security forces , an ongoing entente between iraq 's shia and sunni arabs and the kurds and continued political power sharing , showed promise and progress .
the strengthening of a fragile democracy , and significantly where no such tradition had ever existed , the inability of the violence to overturn successive elections , even where they were marred , pointed the way to a better iraq .
can the violence be contained ?
if not an iraq free from violence , then at least an iraq more able to contain the violence , able to change and evolve its own political culture and once more able to focus on reconstruction , growth and stability and a sense of greater security wished for by the bulk of a war-exhausted population .
so can the bombings overturn all that has been gained and stands to be gained , is the fabric of the new iraq so frail still , that it may be torn apart yet again ?
has the terrorist hydra returned undiminished ?
according to a canberra-based islamic world and conflict specialist with over 10 years of experience working on iraq issues , who spoke exclusively to deutsche welle on condition of anonymity , the answer is quite succinct . " not necessarily , al qaeda is symptomatic , not systemic . "
so perhaps al qaeda is just stirring the pot , taking advantage of the political turmoil to try and provoke greater unrest by escalating violence .
political tension gives rise to more violence bildunterschrift : will sunnis and kurds one day march together to achieve change for their country ?
the political tension exacerbating the impact of the bombings revolves over a dispute between sunnis and kurds over the allocation of new parliamentary seats and the handling of the affair by prime minister nouri al-malaki 's shia-led administration .
as it stands now , sunni anger is growing and the newest round of elections set for the new year have been postponed until at least february .
it matters less how it came about and more so that the sunnis , who once ruled supreme , remain fearful and bitter over anything that smacks of their becoming a disenfranchised minority . the now dominant , majority shia and the largely autonomous small but powerful and well-organized kurds , both of whom suffered severely under saddam 's sunni-led baathist regime , are just as eager to secure their preeminence and regional sovereignty .

and it must be remembered that it is not a monolithic and centralized organization , but rather a very diverse , often fractured group , whose strength and effectiveness can ebb and flow . and in iraq the face and shape of al qaeda has changed according to the conflict analyst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda in iraq may not be the force it once was but it remains a disruptive element " it has limited capacity , -lrb- it 's an -rrb- organization broken down into various groups that have lost much of their capacity to strike , including allegedly a syrian wing , iranian wing and an iraqi wing , with various splinters and groups or individuals for hire . "
so if al qaeda remains a pernicious presence in iraq 's internal affairs largely manipulated by outside forces , the greater threat to stability rests in keeping sectarian passions down to a manageable discussion , one that prefers the ballot box and heated political argument to disagreements with rocket launchers , bombs and kalashnikov rifles .
if sunni anger becomes a more open and widespread insurrection again , then the shia-dominated military and security forces will likely take on a more sectarian rather than national identity and certainly will be perceived as such .
as likely would follow the resurgence of shia militias , who remain largely organizationally intact .
watching such a scenario unfold , the kurds would attempt to seal themselves off , but would also face threats from growing arab nationalist sentiment in oil-rich areas where the kurds rule over an ethnically diverse population .
iran , turkey and syria will all be watching closely as well , regarding the de facto kurdish statelet as a potential instigator of kurdish uprising within their own borders .
iraqis hope for political stability the hope of the average men and women on the streets of iraq who simply long for peace and stability , is that al-maliki has to continue to show convincing leadership and deliver genuine security after the expected phased us withdrawal in 2010 through 2011 and fully be master of his own house .
part of the psychological success of the surge was to lower both the presence and profile of american troops largely confined to their bases and show the ground and security increasingly in iraqi hands .
and if the ongoing viability of an iraq fully in iraqi hands is the contingent prerequisite for a us military pullout , then that too may be under reconsideration in washington if the situation worsens . al-malakis soldiers , policemen and government may not be ready .
the reverse may also be true , the new iraq , though still facing test by fire , may well be ready to confront its demons on its own .
the events yet to unfold before the next election will tell us more .
what follows if iraqis alone can not fill the security vacuum left by an expected american withdrawal will further set the stage .
iraq itself , like its president , its government , its military and police , its society and institutions has to muster the strength of its convictions to uphold a national rather than a sectarian ideal .
that also may be too soon to call and the process remains fragile . author : chris kline editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he proposes an independent ratings agency to alert users to these risks . germany 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information peter schaar has warned that many social networking sites still have n't totally gotten on board with protecting users ' data .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , schaar specifically mentioned facebook , the largest of such sites , and its recent changes to its privacy settings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar wants social networking sites to do more to protect users ' information the default of the new setup puts everyone at the weakest privacy level , making their personal information and uploaded photos public .
while users did have to accept the changes , schaar still considers this to be user protection " unfriendly . "
" you press ' next ' and then suddenly you 've made your information totally available without the original access restrictions , " he said .
privacy advocates in the us have filed complaints with the federal trade commission over the new changes and have called on facebook to restore the old settings .
independent evaluation schaar told dpa he 's not against social networks in general .
" what 's important to me , " he said , " is that people are aware of what they 're doing , what information they 're putting on the internet and the problems associated with certain activities . "
it can be difficult to encourage companies like facebook that are based outside of germany to change their policies , schaar said .
he added that cooperation at the international level will be necessary to combat the problem of lax data protection rules .
in particular , schaar suggested the establishment of an independent consumer protection agency that could evaluate social networks , giving them grades on their privacy policies and let user know which sites protected them the best .
such an agency was part of the coalition agreement between chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and their coalition partners the free democrats. hf / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lasting peace in the war-ravaged country could only be achieved , he added , if moderate taliban members were allowed to participate in afghanistan 's democracy .
" because we are in a country with such regional diversity , " guttenberg told the paper , " we ca n't just leave out an entire ethnic group like the pashtuns if we want sustainable solutions for the future . "
certain conditions would need to be fulfilled , however , and it would be unacceptable for the afghan government to ignore universal human rights .
" we must ask ourselves who from the insurgents poses a serious threat to the international community and who is more concerned with the conditions in afghanistan itself , " he said .
" this issue of human rights must also be taken into account , without ignoring the existing cultures and traditions in afghanistan . "
guttenberg has in the past week indicated a willingness to engage in peace talks with non-terrorist taliban members , marking a change in german policy. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the evolution of piracy in somalia is inextricably linked to the collapse of somalia as a nation state , ravaged by conflict between rebels and government troops . the key pirate enclave is in northeastern somalia , in a region known as puntland where the pirates live as an autonomous presence .
among the five dominant seagoing criminal organizations based in somalia who generate revenues of between $ 100 to 150 million -lrb- 69 million to 104 million euros -rrb- a year , largely in ransom payments , many of the pirates were former clan fighters who discovered a far more lucrative form of armed capitalism .
others were mere humble fishermen who claim their livelihood has been lost to the industrial methods of international fishing fleets that indeed poach an estimated $ 300 million worth of fish a year from somali waters .
poverty , lack of development and hunger as ever are key factors for conflict , violence and brigandage in africa .
then there are the linkages to the outside world , the patrons , allies and benefactors , of what is a transnational business , so pirate arms come from yemen , much of the money is laundered in lebanon and there are other suspected but more opaque linkages in dubai .
however , the international community has not pierced the internal network linked to the pirate trail deeply and is lacking crucial access in terms of its intelligence gathering capacities within the secret structures that partner piracy .
limited military success against pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces managed to disrupt the pirates ' activities but their successes were few and far between where somalia 's pirates once confined themselves to the gulf of aden , they now launch raids and ship boarding as far away as the indian ocean on the kenyan coast .
there is un resolution 1838 in place authorizing lethal military force to curb or counter somalia 's pirates in international waters .
there is a multinational naval flotilla patrolling off the horn , combined task force 151 , that deploys warships , aircraft and naval special forces ship boarding parties , from european , us , and indian , russian and chinese contributors .
there have some successes scored by us and french special operations groups intercepting or eliminating pirates and freeing hostages and hijacked vessels , but with some 2000 miles -lrb- 3,218 km -rrb- of coast to secure , it amounts to a bathtub navy , although the squadron is a powerful one , that seldom can take a proactive approach or deter much .
but when the waterway under threat plays such a crucial strategic and mercantile role , and it is n't merely yachts that are captured or threatened but oil tankers , chemical ships , weapons bearing cargo ships and all manner of large civil vessels that are under threat , why have n't naval efforts been massively increased ?
moreover , when there are only an estimated 1,000 pirates concentrated mostly in a single coastal harbor town , why has n't the international community , as india has suggested , simply mounted a sharp amphibious assault ? to be sure there are some hawks and one former european military and intelligence officer who spoke to deusche welle anonymously said bluntly " what we need now is one short , sharp stroke and just take them out . " bildunterschrift : the un was often found lacking in its attempts to find a solution to the piracy issue the experience of the un peacekeeping mission and the ferocity of the fighting then and now , when somali violence reaches a crescendo , are cautiously remembered by many otherwise perhaps contemplating some sort of lethal strike , direct action in military terms against the pirates .
a combined sea , air and amphibious assault by marines and naval special forces comes to mind , but it would be a delicate and complex affair to orchestrate , plan and execute on a battleground that could draw in international forces into an unwanted quagmire or at least a costly battle .
the potential for large scale civilian casualties would further exacerbate the chance for a disaster .
political will lacking to back use of force and not least political will may be lacking among some of the potential partners for a concerted use of force , where consensus would be necessary .
in short , if a deeper military solution would be attempted to shut down somalia 's pirate problem , it must be on a unified front , on a greater scale than piecemeal efforts and with sufficient , overwhelming force and resources .
but again when so much key intelligence gathering is lacking , any potential decisive campaign against the pirates is hampered by a lack of actionable knowledge .
poor intelligence analysis led to earlier international fiascos in somalia and the question of piracy poses as vexing a question to resolve as all else that ails somalia and its larger , chronic state as a failed nation without the effective rule of law or much hope for far too long .
for the present some of the most dangerous waters in the world off the horn of africa , will remain as treacherous as ever in 2010 precisely because somalia is still a hungry , desperate and violent place .

will the scenes of violent bedlam return in 2010 ? iraq had once seemed condemned to a near-endless cycle of slaughter . at their most lethal the heavy years of the gun and the bomb were a brutal combination of terror attacks , internecine sectarian fighting , rampant criminal activity and combat with and military action by coalition forces that collectively , according to the british medical journal the lancet , may have caused between 600,000 to over a million , mostly civilian fatalities .
containing the killing seemed an improbable and daunting task .
trying to forge some sense of post-saddam national unity , cohesion , strength and viability as a nascent , newly democratic iraq , seemed as challenging and as unlikely .
as ever the devil is in the mix , the complex tapestry of iraq 's divisive , sectarian history and the tribal , multicultural , religious , ethnic and regional fault lines that underscore it , a reality the invasion had so poorly prepared for . but the success of the us-led military surge in curbing the epidemic spiral of violence , the steady buildup , confidence and capability of the reborn iraqi army and security forces , an ongoing entente between iraq 's shia and sunni arabs and the kurds and continued political power sharing , showed promise and progress .
the strengthening of a fragile democracy , and significantly where no such tradition had ever existed , the inability of the violence to overturn successive elections , even where they were marred , pointed the way to a better iraq .
can the violence be contained ?
if not an iraq free from violence , then at least an iraq more able to contain the violence , able to change and evolve its own political culture and once more able to focus on reconstruction , growth and stability and a sense of greater security wished for by the bulk of a war-exhausted population .
so can the bombings overturn all that has been gained and stands to be gained , is the fabric of the new iraq so frail still , that it may be torn apart yet again ?
has the terrorist hydra returned undiminished ?
according to a canberra-based islamic world and conflict specialist with over 10 years of experience working on iraq issues , who spoke exclusively to deutsche welle on condition of anonymity , the answer is quite succinct . " not necessarily , al qaeda is symptomatic , not systemic . "
so perhaps al qaeda is just stirring the pot , taking advantage of the political turmoil to try and provoke greater unrest by escalating violence .
political tension gives rise to more violence bildunterschrift : will sunnis and kurds one day march together to achieve change for their country ?
the political tension exacerbating the impact of the bombings revolves over a dispute between sunnis and kurds over the allocation of new parliamentary seats and the handling of the affair by prime minister nouri al-malaki 's shia-led administration .
as it stands now , sunni anger is growing and the newest round of elections set for the new year have been postponed until at least february .
it matters less how it came about and more so that the sunnis , who once ruled supreme , remain fearful and bitter over anything that smacks of their becoming a disenfranchised minority . the now dominant , majority shia and the largely autonomous small but powerful and well-organized kurds , both of whom suffered severely under saddam 's sunni-led baathist regime , are just as eager to secure their preeminence and regional sovereignty .
for the shia it means wielding the greatest power in leading iraq .
for the kurds to retain the quasi-federated status of their would-be statelet in northern iraq and a strong voice in national affairs and not least retention of their military and militia forces , home rule and control of the oil reserves within their sphere .
al qaeda split but still a force to be reckoned with and what is the state of al qaeda , how badly has it been hit , are the attacks indicative of its overall capabilities ?
and it must be remembered that it is not a monolithic and centralized organization , but rather a very diverse , often fractured group , whose strength and effectiveness can ebb and flow . and in iraq the face and shape of al qaeda has changed according to the conflict analyst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda in iraq may not be the force it once was but it remains a disruptive element " it has limited capacity , -lrb- it 's an -rrb- organization broken down into various groups that have lost much of their capacity to strike , including allegedly a syrian wing , iranian wing and an iraqi wing , with various splinters and groups or individuals for hire . "
so if al qaeda remains a pernicious presence in iraq 's internal affairs largely manipulated by outside forces , the greater threat to stability rests in keeping sectarian passions down to a manageable discussion , one that prefers the ballot box and heated political argument to disagreements with rocket launchers , bombs and kalashnikov rifles .
if sunni anger becomes a more open and widespread insurrection again , then the shia-dominated military and security forces will likely take on a more sectarian rather than national identity and certainly will be perceived as such .
as likely would follow the resurgence of shia militias , who remain largely organizationally intact .
watching such a scenario unfold , the kurds would attempt to seal themselves off , but would also face threats from growing arab nationalist sentiment in oil-rich areas where the kurds rule over an ethnically diverse population .
iran , turkey and syria will all be watching closely as well , regarding the de facto kurdish statelet as a potential instigator of kurdish uprising within their own borders .
iraqis hope for political stability the hope of the average men and women on the streets of iraq who simply long for peace and stability , is that al-maliki has to continue to show convincing leadership and deliver genuine security after the expected phased us withdrawal in 2010 through 2011 and fully be master of his own house .
part of the psychological success of the surge was to lower both the presence and profile of american troops largely confined to their bases and show the ground and security increasingly in iraqi hands .
and if the ongoing viability of an iraq fully in iraqi hands is the contingent prerequisite for a us military pullout , then that too may be under reconsideration in washington if the situation worsens . al-malakis soldiers , policemen and government may not be ready .
the reverse may also be true , the new iraq , though still facing test by fire , may well be ready to confront its demons on its own .
the events yet to unfold before the next election will tell us more .
what follows if iraqis alone can not fill the security vacuum left by an expected american withdrawal will further set the stage .
iraq itself , like its president , its government , its military and police , its society and institutions has to muster the strength of its convictions to uphold a national rather than a sectarian ideal .
that also may be too soon to call and the process remains fragile . author : chris kline editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he proposes an independent ratings agency to alert users to these risks . germany 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information peter schaar has warned that many social networking sites still have n't totally gotten on board with protecting users ' data .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , schaar specifically mentioned facebook , the largest of such sites , and its recent changes to its privacy settings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar wants social networking sites to do more to protect users ' information the default of the new setup puts everyone at the weakest privacy level , making their personal information and uploaded photos public .
while users did have to accept the changes , schaar still considers this to be user protection " unfriendly . "
" you press ' next ' and then suddenly you 've made your information totally available without the original access restrictions , " he said .
privacy advocates in the us have filed complaints with the federal trade commission over the new changes and have called on facebook to restore the old settings .
independent evaluation schaar told dpa he 's not against social networks in general .
" what 's important to me , " he said , " is that people are aware of what they 're doing , what information they 're putting on the internet and the problems associated with certain activities . "
it can be difficult to encourage companies like facebook that are based outside of germany to change their policies , schaar said .
he added that cooperation at the international level will be necessary to combat the problem of lax data protection rules .
in particular , schaar suggested the establishment of an independent consumer protection agency that could evaluate social networks , giving them grades on their privacy policies and let user know which sites protected them the best .
such an agency was part of the coalition agreement between chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and their coalition partners the free democrats. hf / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey says those arrested were suspected of having ties with kurdish separatists . news reports say eight protestors were hurt and a dozen others were arrested after clashes between kurdish protestors and turkish police .
the demonstrations were in response to last week 's arrest of kurdish officials with alleged ties to kurdish separatists .
clashes between masked youths and riot police broke out in the towns of hakkari and yuksekova , in southeastern turkey . two police officers are reported to be among the injured .
alleged ties to separatists last thursday , turkish police rounded up 31 people , including eight kurdish mayors , as part of its investigation into the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and its off-shoots .
earlier this month , the pro-kurdish democratic society party was banned from government for its alleged links to the pkk .
the pkk , which has been fighting an insurgency for kurdish independence since 1984 , is considered a terrorist organization by ankara and much of the international community .
the pkk 's fight with the turkish government has claimed roughly 45,000 lives .
kurdish protests have stepped up since october , first over the prison conditions of pkk founder abdullah ocalan , and more recently over the banning of the democratic society party .
turkey , in its bid to join the eu , has pledged reforms for the kurdish minority in the hope of easing tensions. mk / afp / ap editor : wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here we ask paul chapman , a regular independent soccer analyst for deutsche welle , his opinions on the season so far . dw : what were the best and worst games of the first half of the season in your opinion ?
paul chapman : one thing is virtually certain and that is that we wo n't see a crazier game this season than the one on december 12 which finished borussia moenchengladbach 5 hanover 3 .
what made the fixture amazing was that six of the goals were scored by hanover players .
three went into the borussia net and three into the hannover net .
so from hanover 's point of view at least , this must have been the worst game of the season so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's 4-1 victory in turin was a vintage performance the best for me has to be bayern munich 's qualification for the knockout stages of the champions league this season .
with bayern seemingly going out in the group stages , they managed by a combination of results to give themselves hope going into the final game .
it was clear enough : bayern munich , if they wanted to progress , had to go to turin and beat juventus .
after so much criticism from the fans and the media , bayern munich turned the clock back to treat us to a display equal to anything they 've ever produced in europe .
they beat juventus 4-1 with an outstanding performance and they provided us with a magnificent match featuring all that 's best in football .

the big brazilian has struggled to produce anything like his previous form and what is worrying is that not only have the goals dried up but also he seems short of pace and he 's robbed by defenders too easily .
the big striker still looks a mere shadow of the man who outscored everyone in the bundesliga last season and helped the wolves to the title .
what was the biggest surprise in the first half of the season , in your opinion ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm 's outburst was a surprising break of character philipp lahm being disciplined by his club bayern munich for speaking out about what he saw as the club being run badly because lahm is not a player you would expect to speak out of turn .
however , at the time he spoke out , the state of things at bayern munich suggested he was right .
his comments seemed to suggest a big rift between the players and the new coach louis van gaal .
lahm was fined 25,000 euros by bayern and warned about his future behaviour and the matter was supposedly done and dusted .
lahm was n't dropped but his next two outings for bayern were probably the worst performances he 'd ever given for the club .
what was the least surprising thing you witnessed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a career of madness continues in lehmann 's 40th year jens lehmann still acting the fool !
you 'd think at the ripe old age of 40 , he would have put all his crazy stunts behind him and that he 'd now be a role model for others but sadly he never has been and obviously never will be .
take the recent game against mainz .
stuttgart were on course for a vital 1-0 victory , but after spending the majority of the game provoking the mainz players , lehmann capped an insane performance by deliberately stamped on the foot of mainz striker bance .
unfortunately for lehmann , the referee clearly saw the situation and did n't hesitate to send lehmann off and award mainz a penalty which was duly scored in the 90th minute and so the 1-0 victory that was in stuttgart 's hands was thrown away by lehmann 's moment of madness .
the first half of the 2009/10 season will always be remembered for the tragic death of robert enke .
what are your memories of robert enke and your feelings towards his death ?
i 've been reporting on german football for over 30 years now and two of the saddest stories in that period have involved the enke family .
first there was death of little lara and then the tragic suicide of robert .
enke was the star and the captain at hanover 96 .
he looked certain to be on the plane to south africa this coming summer with the world cup squad .
he had a supportive wife , a lovely home and several dogs which he 'd rescued from the streets .
he was quite simply a top sportsman and a very decent man .
the sad truth though is that he suffered from depression and had done for six years .
at times it had been worse than at others and certainly it must have been the lowest point of robert and wife teresa 's lives when their lovely two year old daughter lara died in september 2006 .
in march of that year , there had been genuine hope that lara might live and who will ever forget the joyous scenes after hannover beat cologne 1-0 in march 2006 at the awd arena and robert enke raced around the pitch after the match with his precious lara in his arms .
they were wonderful scenes and robert , a man who did n't smile too often , was positively beaming that day .
bildunterschrift : it was fear that eventually drove robert enke to suicide .
he was scared that if people discovered he suffered from depression , he 'd be driven out of football and he worried too that the authorities might take away the daughter which robert and teresa had adopted earlier in 2009 and he wanted so badly that they 'd be allowed to keep leila .
robert enke hid the secret that he suffered from depression but the illness tormented him and also his desire to be with his daughter lara again and sure enough he visited her grave before taking the fateful final steps of walking under a speeding train .
the grief and shock within german football was there for all to see and dfb president theo zwanziger hoped that it might bring everybody closer together but it has n't had any lasting affect .
fan violence , bad sportsmanship and coaches losing their jobs are still the order of the day but the passing of robert enke did have an affect in that other people who suffer from depression have found it easier now to talk about their affliction .
robert enke will be remembered as a fine man and an outstanding goalkeeper .

he proposes an independent ratings agency to alert users to these risks . germany 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information peter schaar has warned that many social networking sites still have n't totally gotten on board with protecting users ' data .

he added that cooperation at the international level will be necessary to combat the problem of lax data protection rules .
in particular , schaar suggested the establishment of an independent consumer protection agency that could evaluate social networks , giving them grades on their privacy policies and let user know which sites protected them the best .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : iraq : the rocky road to democracy and stability power struggles at heart of iraq impasse threaten fragile security experts fear integration of former insurgents threatens iraq 's security iraq 's elections will feature less us presence , but more concerns iraq oil auctions cause concerns over stability in gulf hierarchy iraq -pipe- 27.12.2009 iraq at a crossroads : a return to chaos or are better times ahead ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent carnage in iraq has raised fears that 2010 will continue in the same vein the spate of recent bombings in baghdad has evoked memories of the carnage that typified the worst of iraq ’ s insurgency at the height of the country ’ s civil war .
will the scenes of violent bedlam return in 2010 ? iraq had once seemed condemned to a near-endless cycle of slaughter . at their most lethal the heavy years of the gun and the bomb were a brutal combination of terror attacks , internecine sectarian fighting , rampant criminal activity and combat with and military action by coalition forces that collectively , according to the british medical journal the lancet , may have caused between 600,000 to over a million , mostly civilian fatalities .
containing the killing seemed an improbable and daunting task .
trying to forge some sense of post-saddam national unity , cohesion , strength and viability as a nascent , newly democratic iraq , seemed as challenging and as unlikely .
as ever the devil is in the mix , the complex tapestry of iraq 's divisive , sectarian history and the tribal , multicultural , religious , ethnic and regional fault lines that underscore it , a reality the invasion had so poorly prepared for . but the success of the us-led military surge in curbing the epidemic spiral of violence , the steady buildup , confidence and capability of the reborn iraqi army and security forces , an ongoing entente between iraq 's shia and sunni arabs and the kurds and continued political power sharing , showed promise and progress .
the strengthening of a fragile democracy , and significantly where no such tradition had ever existed , the inability of the violence to overturn successive elections , even where they were marred , pointed the way to a better iraq .
can the violence be contained ?
if not an iraq free from violence , then at least an iraq more able to contain the violence , able to change and evolve its own political culture and once more able to focus on reconstruction , growth and stability and a sense of greater security wished for by the bulk of a war-exhausted population .
so can the bombings overturn all that has been gained and stands to be gained , is the fabric of the new iraq so frail still , that it may be torn apart yet again ?
has the terrorist hydra returned undiminished ?
according to a canberra-based islamic world and conflict specialist with over 10 years of experience working on iraq issues , who spoke exclusively to deutsche welle on condition of anonymity , the answer is quite succinct . " not necessarily , al qaeda is symptomatic , not systemic . "
so perhaps al qaeda is just stirring the pot , taking advantage of the political turmoil to try and provoke greater unrest by escalating violence .
political tension gives rise to more violence bildunterschrift : will sunnis and kurds one day march together to achieve change for their country ?
the political tension exacerbating the impact of the bombings revolves over a dispute between sunnis and kurds over the allocation of new parliamentary seats and the handling of the affair by prime minister nouri al-malaki 's shia-led administration .
as it stands now , sunni anger is growing and the newest round of elections set for the new year have been postponed until at least february .
it matters less how it came about and more so that the sunnis , who once ruled supreme , remain fearful and bitter over anything that smacks of their becoming a disenfranchised minority . the now dominant , majority shia and the largely autonomous small but powerful and well-organized kurds , both of whom suffered severely under saddam 's sunni-led baathist regime , are just as eager to secure their preeminence and regional sovereignty .
for the shia it means wielding the greatest power in leading iraq .
for the kurds to retain the quasi-federated status of their would-be statelet in northern iraq and a strong voice in national affairs and not least retention of their military and militia forces , home rule and control of the oil reserves within their sphere .
al qaeda split but still a force to be reckoned with and what is the state of al qaeda , how badly has it been hit , are the attacks indicative of its overall capabilities ?
and it must be remembered that it is not a monolithic and centralized organization , but rather a very diverse , often fractured group , whose strength and effectiveness can ebb and flow . and in iraq the face and shape of al qaeda has changed according to the conflict analyst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda in iraq may not be the force it once was but it remains a disruptive element " it has limited capacity , -lrb- it 's an -rrb- organization broken down into various groups that have lost much of their capacity to strike , including allegedly a syrian wing , iranian wing and an iraqi wing , with various splinters and groups or individuals for hire . "
so if al qaeda remains a pernicious presence in iraq 's internal affairs largely manipulated by outside forces , the greater threat to stability rests in keeping sectarian passions down to a manageable discussion , one that prefers the ballot box and heated political argument to disagreements with rocket launchers , bombs and kalashnikov rifles .
if sunni anger becomes a more open and widespread insurrection again , then the shia-dominated military and security forces will likely take on a more sectarian rather than national identity and certainly will be perceived as such .
as likely would follow the resurgence of shia militias , who remain largely organizationally intact .
watching such a scenario unfold , the kurds would attempt to seal themselves off , but would also face threats from growing arab nationalist sentiment in oil-rich areas where the kurds rule over an ethnically diverse population .
iran , turkey and syria will all be watching closely as well , regarding the de facto kurdish statelet as a potential instigator of kurdish uprising within their own borders .
iraqis hope for political stability the hope of the average men and women on the streets of iraq who simply long for peace and stability , is that al-maliki has to continue to show convincing leadership and deliver genuine security after the expected phased us withdrawal in 2010 through 2011 and fully be master of his own house .
part of the psychological success of the surge was to lower both the presence and profile of american troops largely confined to their bases and show the ground and security increasingly in iraqi hands .
and if the ongoing viability of an iraq fully in iraqi hands is the contingent prerequisite for a us military pullout , then that too may be under reconsideration in washington if the situation worsens . al-malakis soldiers , policemen and government may not be ready .
the reverse may also be true , the new iraq , though still facing test by fire , may well be ready to confront its demons on its own .
the events yet to unfold before the next election will tell us more .
what follows if iraqis alone can not fill the security vacuum left by an expected american withdrawal will further set the stage .
iraq itself , like its president , its government , its military and police , its society and institutions has to muster the strength of its convictions to uphold a national rather than a sectarian ideal .
that also may be too soon to call and the process remains fragile . author : chris kline editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the scenes of violent bedlam return in 2010 ? iraq had once seemed condemned to a near-endless cycle of slaughter . at their most lethal the heavy years of the gun and the bomb were a brutal combination of terror attacks , internecine sectarian fighting , rampant criminal activity and combat with and military action by coalition forces that collectively , according to the british medical journal the lancet , may have caused between 600,000 to over a million , mostly civilian fatalities .
containing the killing seemed an improbable and daunting task .
trying to forge some sense of post-saddam national unity , cohesion , strength and viability as a nascent , newly democratic iraq , seemed as challenging and as unlikely .
as ever the devil is in the mix , the complex tapestry of iraq 's divisive , sectarian history and the tribal , multicultural , religious , ethnic and regional fault lines that underscore it , a reality the invasion had so poorly prepared for . but the success of the us-led military surge in curbing the epidemic spiral of violence , the steady buildup , confidence and capability of the reborn iraqi army and security forces , an ongoing entente between iraq 's shia and sunni arabs and the kurds and continued political power sharing , showed promise and progress .
the strengthening of a fragile democracy , and significantly where no such tradition had ever existed , the inability of the violence to overturn successive elections , even where they were marred , pointed the way to a better iraq .
can the violence be contained ?
if not an iraq free from violence , then at least an iraq more able to contain the violence , able to change and evolve its own political culture and once more able to focus on reconstruction , growth and stability and a sense of greater security wished for by the bulk of a war-exhausted population .
so can the bombings overturn all that has been gained and stands to be gained , is the fabric of the new iraq so frail still , that it may be torn apart yet again ?
has the terrorist hydra returned undiminished ?
according to a canberra-based islamic world and conflict specialist with over 10 years of experience working on iraq issues , who spoke exclusively to deutsche welle on condition of anonymity , the answer is quite succinct . " not necessarily , al qaeda is symptomatic , not systemic . "
so perhaps al qaeda is just stirring the pot , taking advantage of the political turmoil to try and provoke greater unrest by escalating violence .
political tension gives rise to more violence bildunterschrift : will sunnis and kurds one day march together to achieve change for their country ?
the political tension exacerbating the impact of the bombings revolves over a dispute between sunnis and kurds over the allocation of new parliamentary seats and the handling of the affair by prime minister nouri al-malaki 's shia-led administration .
as it stands now , sunni anger is growing and the newest round of elections set for the new year have been postponed until at least february .
it matters less how it came about and more so that the sunnis , who once ruled supreme , remain fearful and bitter over anything that smacks of their becoming a disenfranchised minority . the now dominant , majority shia and the largely autonomous small but powerful and well-organized kurds , both of whom suffered severely under saddam 's sunni-led baathist regime , are just as eager to secure their preeminence and regional sovereignty .
for the shia it means wielding the greatest power in leading iraq .
for the kurds to retain the quasi-federated status of their would-be statelet in northern iraq and a strong voice in national affairs and not least retention of their military and militia forces , home rule and control of the oil reserves within their sphere .
al qaeda split but still a force to be reckoned with and what is the state of al qaeda , how badly has it been hit , are the attacks indicative of its overall capabilities ?
and it must be remembered that it is not a monolithic and centralized organization , but rather a very diverse , often fractured group , whose strength and effectiveness can ebb and flow . and in iraq the face and shape of al qaeda has changed according to the conflict analyst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda in iraq may not be the force it once was but it remains a disruptive element " it has limited capacity , -lrb- it 's an -rrb- organization broken down into various groups that have lost much of their capacity to strike , including allegedly a syrian wing , iranian wing and an iraqi wing , with various splinters and groups or individuals for hire . "
so if al qaeda remains a pernicious presence in iraq 's internal affairs largely manipulated by outside forces , the greater threat to stability rests in keeping sectarian passions down to a manageable discussion , one that prefers the ballot box and heated political argument to disagreements with rocket launchers , bombs and kalashnikov rifles .
if sunni anger becomes a more open and widespread insurrection again , then the shia-dominated military and security forces will likely take on a more sectarian rather than national identity and certainly will be perceived as such .
as likely would follow the resurgence of shia militias , who remain largely organizationally intact .
watching such a scenario unfold , the kurds would attempt to seal themselves off , but would also face threats from growing arab nationalist sentiment in oil-rich areas where the kurds rule over an ethnically diverse population .
iran , turkey and syria will all be watching closely as well , regarding the de facto kurdish statelet as a potential instigator of kurdish uprising within their own borders .
iraqis hope for political stability the hope of the average men and women on the streets of iraq who simply long for peace and stability , is that al-maliki has to continue to show convincing leadership and deliver genuine security after the expected phased us withdrawal in 2010 through 2011 and fully be master of his own house .
part of the psychological success of the surge was to lower both the presence and profile of american troops largely confined to their bases and show the ground and security increasingly in iraqi hands .
and if the ongoing viability of an iraq fully in iraqi hands is the contingent prerequisite for a us military pullout , then that too may be under reconsideration in washington if the situation worsens . al-malakis soldiers , policemen and government may not be ready .
the reverse may also be true , the new iraq , though still facing test by fire , may well be ready to confront its demons on its own .
the events yet to unfold before the next election will tell us more .
what follows if iraqis alone can not fill the security vacuum left by an expected american withdrawal will further set the stage .
iraq itself , like its president , its government , its military and police , its society and institutions has to muster the strength of its convictions to uphold a national rather than a sectarian ideal .
that also may be too soon to call and the process remains fragile . author : chris kline editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey says those arrested were suspected of having ties with kurdish separatists . news reports say eight protestors were hurt and a dozen others were arrested after clashes between kurdish protestors and turkish police .
the demonstrations were in response to last week 's arrest of kurdish officials with alleged ties to kurdish separatists .
clashes between masked youths and riot police broke out in the towns of hakkari and yuksekova , in southeastern turkey . two police officers are reported to be among the injured .
alleged ties to separatists last thursday , turkish police rounded up 31 people , including eight kurdish mayors , as part of its investigation into the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and its off-shoots .
earlier this month , the pro-kurdish democratic society party was banned from government for its alleged links to the pkk .

the evolution of piracy in somalia is inextricably linked to the collapse of somalia as a nation state , ravaged by conflict between rebels and government troops . the key pirate enclave is in northeastern somalia , in a region known as puntland where the pirates live as an autonomous presence .
among the five dominant seagoing criminal organizations based in somalia who generate revenues of between $ 100 to 150 million -lrb- 69 million to 104 million euros -rrb- a year , largely in ransom payments , many of the pirates were former clan fighters who discovered a far more lucrative form of armed capitalism .
others were mere humble fishermen who claim their livelihood has been lost to the industrial methods of international fishing fleets that indeed poach an estimated $ 300 million worth of fish a year from somali waters .
poverty , lack of development and hunger as ever are key factors for conflict , violence and brigandage in africa .
then there are the linkages to the outside world , the patrons , allies and benefactors , of what is a transnational business , so pirate arms come from yemen , much of the money is laundered in lebanon and there are other suspected but more opaque linkages in dubai .
however , the international community has not pierced the internal network linked to the pirate trail deeply and is lacking crucial access in terms of its intelligence gathering capacities within the secret structures that partner piracy .
limited military success against pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces managed to disrupt the pirates ' activities but their successes were few and far between where somalia 's pirates once confined themselves to the gulf of aden , they now launch raids and ship boarding as far away as the indian ocean on the kenyan coast .
there is un resolution 1838 in place authorizing lethal military force to curb or counter somalia 's pirates in international waters .
there is a multinational naval flotilla patrolling off the horn , combined task force 151 , that deploys warships , aircraft and naval special forces ship boarding parties , from european , us , and indian , russian and chinese contributors .
there have some successes scored by us and french special operations groups intercepting or eliminating pirates and freeing hostages and hijacked vessels , but with some 2000 miles -lrb- 3,218 km -rrb- of coast to secure , it amounts to a bathtub navy , although the squadron is a powerful one , that seldom can take a proactive approach or deter much .
but when the waterway under threat plays such a crucial strategic and mercantile role , and it is n't merely yachts that are captured or threatened but oil tankers , chemical ships , weapons bearing cargo ships and all manner of large civil vessels that are under threat , why have n't naval efforts been massively increased ?
moreover , when there are only an estimated 1,000 pirates concentrated mostly in a single coastal harbor town , why has n't the international community , as india has suggested , simply mounted a sharp amphibious assault ? to be sure there are some hawks and one former european military and intelligence officer who spoke to deusche welle anonymously said bluntly " what we need now is one short , sharp stroke and just take them out . " bildunterschrift : the un was often found lacking in its attempts to find a solution to the piracy issue the experience of the un peacekeeping mission and the ferocity of the fighting then and now , when somali violence reaches a crescendo , are cautiously remembered by many otherwise perhaps contemplating some sort of lethal strike , direct action in military terms against the pirates .
a combined sea , air and amphibious assault by marines and naval special forces comes to mind , but it would be a delicate and complex affair to orchestrate , plan and execute on a battleground that could draw in international forces into an unwanted quagmire or at least a costly battle .
the potential for large scale civilian casualties would further exacerbate the chance for a disaster .
political will lacking to back use of force and not least political will may be lacking among some of the potential partners for a concerted use of force , where consensus would be necessary .
in short , if a deeper military solution would be attempted to shut down somalia 's pirate problem , it must be on a unified front , on a greater scale than piecemeal efforts and with sufficient , overwhelming force and resources .
but again when so much key intelligence gathering is lacking , any potential decisive campaign against the pirates is hampered by a lack of actionable knowledge .
poor intelligence analysis led to earlier international fiascos in somalia and the question of piracy poses as vexing a question to resolve as all else that ails somalia and its larger , chronic state as a failed nation without the effective rule of law or much hope for far too long .
for the present some of the most dangerous waters in the world off the horn of africa , will remain as treacherous as ever in 2010 precisely because somalia is still a hungry , desperate and violent place .

the evolution of piracy in somalia is inextricably linked to the collapse of somalia as a nation state , ravaged by conflict between rebels and government troops . the key pirate enclave is in northeastern somalia , in a region known as puntland where the pirates live as an autonomous presence .
among the five dominant seagoing criminal organizations based in somalia who generate revenues of between $ 100 to 150 million -lrb- 69 million to 104 million euros -rrb- a year , largely in ransom payments , many of the pirates were former clan fighters who discovered a far more lucrative form of armed capitalism .
others were mere humble fishermen who claim their livelihood has been lost to the industrial methods of international fishing fleets that indeed poach an estimated $ 300 million worth of fish a year from somali waters .
poverty , lack of development and hunger as ever are key factors for conflict , violence and brigandage in africa .
then there are the linkages to the outside world , the patrons , allies and benefactors , of what is a transnational business , so pirate arms come from yemen , much of the money is laundered in lebanon and there are other suspected but more opaque linkages in dubai .
however , the international community has not pierced the internal network linked to the pirate trail deeply and is lacking crucial access in terms of its intelligence gathering capacities within the secret structures that partner piracy .
limited military success against pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces managed to disrupt the pirates ' activities but their successes were few and far between where somalia 's pirates once confined themselves to the gulf of aden , they now launch raids and ship boarding as far away as the indian ocean on the kenyan coast .
there is un resolution 1838 in place authorizing lethal military force to curb or counter somalia 's pirates in international waters .
there is a multinational naval flotilla patrolling off the horn , combined task force 151 , that deploys warships , aircraft and naval special forces ship boarding parties , from european , us , and indian , russian and chinese contributors .
there have some successes scored by us and french special operations groups intercepting or eliminating pirates and freeing hostages and hijacked vessels , but with some 2000 miles -lrb- 3,218 km -rrb- of coast to secure , it amounts to a bathtub navy , although the squadron is a powerful one , that seldom can take a proactive approach or deter much .
but when the waterway under threat plays such a crucial strategic and mercantile role , and it is n't merely yachts that are captured or threatened but oil tankers , chemical ships , weapons bearing cargo ships and all manner of large civil vessels that are under threat , why have n't naval efforts been massively increased ?
moreover , when there are only an estimated 1,000 pirates concentrated mostly in a single coastal harbor town , why has n't the international community , as india has suggested , simply mounted a sharp amphibious assault ? to be sure there are some hawks and one former european military and intelligence officer who spoke to deusche welle anonymously said bluntly " what we need now is one short , sharp stroke and just take them out . " bildunterschrift : the un was often found lacking in its attempts to find a solution to the piracy issue the experience of the un peacekeeping mission and the ferocity of the fighting then and now , when somali violence reaches a crescendo , are cautiously remembered by many otherwise perhaps contemplating some sort of lethal strike , direct action in military terms against the pirates .
a combined sea , air and amphibious assault by marines and naval special forces comes to mind , but it would be a delicate and complex affair to orchestrate , plan and execute on a battleground that could draw in international forces into an unwanted quagmire or at least a costly battle .
the potential for large scale civilian casualties would further exacerbate the chance for a disaster .
political will lacking to back use of force and not least political will may be lacking among some of the potential partners for a concerted use of force , where consensus would be necessary .
in short , if a deeper military solution would be attempted to shut down somalia 's pirate problem , it must be on a unified front , on a greater scale than piecemeal efforts and with sufficient , overwhelming force and resources .
but again when so much key intelligence gathering is lacking , any potential decisive campaign against the pirates is hampered by a lack of actionable knowledge .
poor intelligence analysis led to earlier international fiascos in somalia and the question of piracy poses as vexing a question to resolve as all else that ails somalia and its larger , chronic state as a failed nation without the effective rule of law or much hope for far too long .
for the present some of the most dangerous waters in the world off the horn of africa , will remain as treacherous as ever in 2010 precisely because somalia is still a hungry , desperate and violent place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2009 somalia-based piracy remains an intractable problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have been a bane to western shipping companies it 's impossible to consider somalia 's pirates in a vacuum .
the evolution of piracy in somalia is inextricably linked to the collapse of somalia as a nation state , ravaged by conflict between rebels and government troops . the key pirate enclave is in northeastern somalia , in a region known as puntland where the pirates live as an autonomous presence .
among the five dominant seagoing criminal organizations based in somalia who generate revenues of between $ 100 to 150 million -lrb- 69 million to 104 million euros -rrb- a year , largely in ransom payments , many of the pirates were former clan fighters who discovered a far more lucrative form of armed capitalism .
others were mere humble fishermen who claim their livelihood has been lost to the industrial methods of international fishing fleets that indeed poach an estimated $ 300 million worth of fish a year from somali waters .
poverty , lack of development and hunger as ever are key factors for conflict , violence and brigandage in africa .
then there are the linkages to the outside world , the patrons , allies and benefactors , of what is a transnational business , so pirate arms come from yemen , much of the money is laundered in lebanon and there are other suspected but more opaque linkages in dubai .
however , the international community has not pierced the internal network linked to the pirate trail deeply and is lacking crucial access in terms of its intelligence gathering capacities within the secret structures that partner piracy .
limited military success against pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces managed to disrupt the pirates ' activities but their successes were few and far between where somalia 's pirates once confined themselves to the gulf of aden , they now launch raids and ship boarding as far away as the indian ocean on the kenyan coast .
there is un resolution 1838 in place authorizing lethal military force to curb or counter somalia 's pirates in international waters .
there is a multinational naval flotilla patrolling off the horn , combined task force 151 , that deploys warships , aircraft and naval special forces ship boarding parties , from european , us , and indian , russian and chinese contributors .
there have some successes scored by us and french special operations groups intercepting or eliminating pirates and freeing hostages and hijacked vessels , but with some 2000 miles -lrb- 3,218 km -rrb- of coast to secure , it amounts to a bathtub navy , although the squadron is a powerful one , that seldom can take a proactive approach or deter much .
but when the waterway under threat plays such a crucial strategic and mercantile role , and it is n't merely yachts that are captured or threatened but oil tankers , chemical ships , weapons bearing cargo ships and all manner of large civil vessels that are under threat , why have n't naval efforts been massively increased ?
moreover , when there are only an estimated 1,000 pirates concentrated mostly in a single coastal harbor town , why has n't the international community , as india has suggested , simply mounted a sharp amphibious assault ? to be sure there are some hawks and one former european military and intelligence officer who spoke to deusche welle anonymously said bluntly " what we need now is one short , sharp stroke and just take them out . " bildunterschrift : the un was often found lacking in its attempts to find a solution to the piracy issue the experience of the un peacekeeping mission and the ferocity of the fighting then and now , when somali violence reaches a crescendo , are cautiously remembered by many otherwise perhaps contemplating some sort of lethal strike , direct action in military terms against the pirates .
a combined sea , air and amphibious assault by marines and naval special forces comes to mind , but it would be a delicate and complex affair to orchestrate , plan and execute on a battleground that could draw in international forces into an unwanted quagmire or at least a costly battle .
the potential for large scale civilian casualties would further exacerbate the chance for a disaster .
political will lacking to back use of force and not least political will may be lacking among some of the potential partners for a concerted use of force , where consensus would be necessary .
in short , if a deeper military solution would be attempted to shut down somalia 's pirate problem , it must be on a unified front , on a greater scale than piecemeal efforts and with sufficient , overwhelming force and resources .
but again when so much key intelligence gathering is lacking , any potential decisive campaign against the pirates is hampered by a lack of actionable knowledge .
poor intelligence analysis led to earlier international fiascos in somalia and the question of piracy poses as vexing a question to resolve as all else that ails somalia and its larger , chronic state as a failed nation without the effective rule of law or much hope for far too long .
for the present some of the most dangerous waters in the world off the horn of africa , will remain as treacherous as ever in 2010 precisely because somalia is still a hungry , desperate and violent place .

it can be difficult to encourage companies like facebook that are based outside of germany to change their policies , schaar said .
he added that cooperation at the international level will be necessary to combat the problem of lax data protection rules .
in particular , schaar suggested the establishment of an independent consumer protection agency that could evaluate social networks , giving them grades on their privacy policies and let user know which sites protected them the best .
such an agency was part of the coalition agreement between chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and their coalition partners the free democrats. hf / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lasting peace in the war-ravaged country could only be achieved , he added , if moderate taliban members were allowed to participate in afghanistan 's democracy .
" because we are in a country with such regional diversity , " guttenberg told the paper , " we ca n't just leave out an entire ethnic group like the pashtuns if we want sustainable solutions for the future . "
certain conditions would need to be fulfilled , however , and it would be unacceptable for the afghan government to ignore universal human rights .
" we must ask ourselves who from the insurgents poses a serious threat to the international community and who is more concerned with the conditions in afghanistan itself , " he said .
" this issue of human rights must also be taken into account , without ignoring the existing cultures and traditions in afghanistan . "
guttenberg has in the past week indicated a willingness to engage in peace talks with non-terrorist taliban members , marking a change in german policy. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : iraq : the rocky road to democracy and stability power struggles at heart of iraq impasse threaten fragile security experts fear integration of former insurgents threatens iraq 's security iraq 's elections will feature less us presence , but more concerns iraq oil auctions cause concerns over stability in gulf hierarchy iraq -pipe- 27.12.2009 iraq at a crossroads : a return to chaos or are better times ahead ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent carnage in iraq has raised fears that 2010 will continue in the same vein the spate of recent bombings in baghdad has evoked memories of the carnage that typified the worst of iraq ’ s insurgency at the height of the country ’ s civil war .
will the scenes of violent bedlam return in 2010 ? iraq had once seemed condemned to a near-endless cycle of slaughter . at their most lethal the heavy years of the gun and the bomb were a brutal combination of terror attacks , internecine sectarian fighting , rampant criminal activity and combat with and military action by coalition forces that collectively , according to the british medical journal the lancet , may have caused between 600,000 to over a million , mostly civilian fatalities .
containing the killing seemed an improbable and daunting task .
trying to forge some sense of post-saddam national unity , cohesion , strength and viability as a nascent , newly democratic iraq , seemed as challenging and as unlikely .
as ever the devil is in the mix , the complex tapestry of iraq 's divisive , sectarian history and the tribal , multicultural , religious , ethnic and regional fault lines that underscore it , a reality the invasion had so poorly prepared for . but the success of the us-led military surge in curbing the epidemic spiral of violence , the steady buildup , confidence and capability of the reborn iraqi army and security forces , an ongoing entente between iraq 's shia and sunni arabs and the kurds and continued political power sharing , showed promise and progress .
the strengthening of a fragile democracy , and significantly where no such tradition had ever existed , the inability of the violence to overturn successive elections , even where they were marred , pointed the way to a better iraq .
can the violence be contained ?
if not an iraq free from violence , then at least an iraq more able to contain the violence , able to change and evolve its own political culture and once more able to focus on reconstruction , growth and stability and a sense of greater security wished for by the bulk of a war-exhausted population .
so can the bombings overturn all that has been gained and stands to be gained , is the fabric of the new iraq so frail still , that it may be torn apart yet again ?
has the terrorist hydra returned undiminished ?
according to a canberra-based islamic world and conflict specialist with over 10 years of experience working on iraq issues , who spoke exclusively to deutsche welle on condition of anonymity , the answer is quite succinct . " not necessarily , al qaeda is symptomatic , not systemic . "
so perhaps al qaeda is just stirring the pot , taking advantage of the political turmoil to try and provoke greater unrest by escalating violence .
political tension gives rise to more violence bildunterschrift : will sunnis and kurds one day march together to achieve change for their country ?
the political tension exacerbating the impact of the bombings revolves over a dispute between sunnis and kurds over the allocation of new parliamentary seats and the handling of the affair by prime minister nouri al-malaki 's shia-led administration .
as it stands now , sunni anger is growing and the newest round of elections set for the new year have been postponed until at least february .
it matters less how it came about and more so that the sunnis , who once ruled supreme , remain fearful and bitter over anything that smacks of their becoming a disenfranchised minority . the now dominant , majority shia and the largely autonomous small but powerful and well-organized kurds , both of whom suffered severely under saddam 's sunni-led baathist regime , are just as eager to secure their preeminence and regional sovereignty .
for the shia it means wielding the greatest power in leading iraq .
for the kurds to retain the quasi-federated status of their would-be statelet in northern iraq and a strong voice in national affairs and not least retention of their military and militia forces , home rule and control of the oil reserves within their sphere .
al qaeda split but still a force to be reckoned with and what is the state of al qaeda , how badly has it been hit , are the attacks indicative of its overall capabilities ?
and it must be remembered that it is not a monolithic and centralized organization , but rather a very diverse , often fractured group , whose strength and effectiveness can ebb and flow . and in iraq the face and shape of al qaeda has changed according to the conflict analyst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda in iraq may not be the force it once was but it remains a disruptive element " it has limited capacity , -lrb- it 's an -rrb- organization broken down into various groups that have lost much of their capacity to strike , including allegedly a syrian wing , iranian wing and an iraqi wing , with various splinters and groups or individuals for hire . "
so if al qaeda remains a pernicious presence in iraq 's internal affairs largely manipulated by outside forces , the greater threat to stability rests in keeping sectarian passions down to a manageable discussion , one that prefers the ballot box and heated political argument to disagreements with rocket launchers , bombs and kalashnikov rifles .
if sunni anger becomes a more open and widespread insurrection again , then the shia-dominated military and security forces will likely take on a more sectarian rather than national identity and certainly will be perceived as such .
as likely would follow the resurgence of shia militias , who remain largely organizationally intact .
watching such a scenario unfold , the kurds would attempt to seal themselves off , but would also face threats from growing arab nationalist sentiment in oil-rich areas where the kurds rule over an ethnically diverse population .
iran , turkey and syria will all be watching closely as well , regarding the de facto kurdish statelet as a potential instigator of kurdish uprising within their own borders .
iraqis hope for political stability the hope of the average men and women on the streets of iraq who simply long for peace and stability , is that al-maliki has to continue to show convincing leadership and deliver genuine security after the expected phased us withdrawal in 2010 through 2011 and fully be master of his own house .
part of the psychological success of the surge was to lower both the presence and profile of american troops largely confined to their bases and show the ground and security increasingly in iraqi hands .
and if the ongoing viability of an iraq fully in iraqi hands is the contingent prerequisite for a us military pullout , then that too may be under reconsideration in washington if the situation worsens . al-malakis soldiers , policemen and government may not be ready .
the reverse may also be true , the new iraq , though still facing test by fire , may well be ready to confront its demons on its own .
the events yet to unfold before the next election will tell us more .
what follows if iraqis alone can not fill the security vacuum left by an expected american withdrawal will further set the stage .
iraq itself , like its president , its government , its military and police , its society and institutions has to muster the strength of its convictions to uphold a national rather than a sectarian ideal .

he proposes an independent ratings agency to alert users to these risks . germany 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information peter schaar has warned that many social networking sites still have n't totally gotten on board with protecting users ' data .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , schaar specifically mentioned facebook , the largest of such sites , and its recent changes to its privacy settings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar wants social networking sites to do more to protect users ' information the default of the new setup puts everyone at the weakest privacy level , making their personal information and uploaded photos public .
while users did have to accept the changes , schaar still considers this to be user protection " unfriendly . "
" you press ' next ' and then suddenly you 've made your information totally available without the original access restrictions , " he said .
privacy advocates in the us have filed complaints with the federal trade commission over the new changes and have called on facebook to restore the old settings .
independent evaluation schaar told dpa he 's not against social networks in general .
" what 's important to me , " he said , " is that people are aware of what they 're doing , what information they 're putting on the internet and the problems associated with certain activities . "
it can be difficult to encourage companies like facebook that are based outside of germany to change their policies , schaar said .
he added that cooperation at the international level will be necessary to combat the problem of lax data protection rules .
in particular , schaar suggested the establishment of an independent consumer protection agency that could evaluate social networks , giving them grades on their privacy policies and let user know which sites protected them the best .
such an agency was part of the coalition agreement between chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and their coalition partners the free democrats. hf / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the evolution of piracy in somalia is inextricably linked to the collapse of somalia as a nation state , ravaged by conflict between rebels and government troops . the key pirate enclave is in northeastern somalia , in a region known as puntland where the pirates live as an autonomous presence .
among the five dominant seagoing criminal organizations based in somalia who generate revenues of between $ 100 to 150 million -lrb- 69 million to 104 million euros -rrb- a year , largely in ransom payments , many of the pirates were former clan fighters who discovered a far more lucrative form of armed capitalism .
others were mere humble fishermen who claim their livelihood has been lost to the industrial methods of international fishing fleets that indeed poach an estimated $ 300 million worth of fish a year from somali waters .
poverty , lack of development and hunger as ever are key factors for conflict , violence and brigandage in africa .
then there are the linkages to the outside world , the patrons , allies and benefactors , of what is a transnational business , so pirate arms come from yemen , much of the money is laundered in lebanon and there are other suspected but more opaque linkages in dubai .
however , the international community has not pierced the internal network linked to the pirate trail deeply and is lacking crucial access in terms of its intelligence gathering capacities within the secret structures that partner piracy .
limited military success against pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces managed to disrupt the pirates ' activities but their successes were few and far between where somalia 's pirates once confined themselves to the gulf of aden , they now launch raids and ship boarding as far away as the indian ocean on the kenyan coast .
there is un resolution 1838 in place authorizing lethal military force to curb or counter somalia 's pirates in international waters .
there is a multinational naval flotilla patrolling off the horn , combined task force 151 , that deploys warships , aircraft and naval special forces ship boarding parties , from european , us , and indian , russian and chinese contributors .
there have some successes scored by us and french special operations groups intercepting or eliminating pirates and freeing hostages and hijacked vessels , but with some 2000 miles -lrb- 3,218 km -rrb- of coast to secure , it amounts to a bathtub navy , although the squadron is a powerful one , that seldom can take a proactive approach or deter much .
but when the waterway under threat plays such a crucial strategic and mercantile role , and it is n't merely yachts that are captured or threatened but oil tankers , chemical ships , weapons bearing cargo ships and all manner of large civil vessels that are under threat , why have n't naval efforts been massively increased ?
moreover , when there are only an estimated 1,000 pirates concentrated mostly in a single coastal harbor town , why has n't the international community , as india has suggested , simply mounted a sharp amphibious assault ? to be sure there are some hawks and one former european military and intelligence officer who spoke to deusche welle anonymously said bluntly " what we need now is one short , sharp stroke and just take them out . " bildunterschrift : the un was often found lacking in its attempts to find a solution to the piracy issue the experience of the un peacekeeping mission and the ferocity of the fighting then and now , when somali violence reaches a crescendo , are cautiously remembered by many otherwise perhaps contemplating some sort of lethal strike , direct action in military terms against the pirates .
a combined sea , air and amphibious assault by marines and naval special forces comes to mind , but it would be a delicate and complex affair to orchestrate , plan and execute on a battleground that could draw in international forces into an unwanted quagmire or at least a costly battle .
the potential for large scale civilian casualties would further exacerbate the chance for a disaster .
political will lacking to back use of force and not least political will may be lacking among some of the potential partners for a concerted use of force , where consensus would be necessary .
in short , if a deeper military solution would be attempted to shut down somalia 's pirate problem , it must be on a unified front , on a greater scale than piecemeal efforts and with sufficient , overwhelming force and resources .
but again when so much key intelligence gathering is lacking , any potential decisive campaign against the pirates is hampered by a lack of actionable knowledge .
poor intelligence analysis led to earlier international fiascos in somalia and the question of piracy poses as vexing a question to resolve as all else that ails somalia and its larger , chronic state as a failed nation without the effective rule of law or much hope for far too long .
for the present some of the most dangerous waters in the world off the horn of africa , will remain as treacherous as ever in 2010 precisely because somalia is still a hungry , desperate and violent place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2009 somalia-based piracy remains an intractable problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have been a bane to western shipping companies it 's impossible to consider somalia 's pirates in a vacuum .
the evolution of piracy in somalia is inextricably linked to the collapse of somalia as a nation state , ravaged by conflict between rebels and government troops . the key pirate enclave is in northeastern somalia , in a region known as puntland where the pirates live as an autonomous presence .
among the five dominant seagoing criminal organizations based in somalia who generate revenues of between $ 100 to 150 million -lrb- 69 million to 104 million euros -rrb- a year , largely in ransom payments , many of the pirates were former clan fighters who discovered a far more lucrative form of armed capitalism .
others were mere humble fishermen who claim their livelihood has been lost to the industrial methods of international fishing fleets that indeed poach an estimated $ 300 million worth of fish a year from somali waters .
poverty , lack of development and hunger as ever are key factors for conflict , violence and brigandage in africa .
then there are the linkages to the outside world , the patrons , allies and benefactors , of what is a transnational business , so pirate arms come from yemen , much of the money is laundered in lebanon and there are other suspected but more opaque linkages in dubai .
however , the international community has not pierced the internal network linked to the pirate trail deeply and is lacking crucial access in terms of its intelligence gathering capacities within the secret structures that partner piracy .
limited military success against pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces managed to disrupt the pirates ' activities but their successes were few and far between where somalia 's pirates once confined themselves to the gulf of aden , they now launch raids and ship boarding as far away as the indian ocean on the kenyan coast .
there is un resolution 1838 in place authorizing lethal military force to curb or counter somalia 's pirates in international waters .
there is a multinational naval flotilla patrolling off the horn , combined task force 151 , that deploys warships , aircraft and naval special forces ship boarding parties , from european , us , and indian , russian and chinese contributors .
there have some successes scored by us and french special operations groups intercepting or eliminating pirates and freeing hostages and hijacked vessels , but with some 2000 miles -lrb- 3,218 km -rrb- of coast to secure , it amounts to a bathtub navy , although the squadron is a powerful one , that seldom can take a proactive approach or deter much .
but when the waterway under threat plays such a crucial strategic and mercantile role , and it is n't merely yachts that are captured or threatened but oil tankers , chemical ships , weapons bearing cargo ships and all manner of large civil vessels that are under threat , why have n't naval efforts been massively increased ?
moreover , when there are only an estimated 1,000 pirates concentrated mostly in a single coastal harbor town , why has n't the international community , as india has suggested , simply mounted a sharp amphibious assault ? to be sure there are some hawks and one former european military and intelligence officer who spoke to deusche welle anonymously said bluntly " what we need now is one short , sharp stroke and just take them out . " bildunterschrift : the un was often found lacking in its attempts to find a solution to the piracy issue the experience of the un peacekeeping mission and the ferocity of the fighting then and now , when somali violence reaches a crescendo , are cautiously remembered by many otherwise perhaps contemplating some sort of lethal strike , direct action in military terms against the pirates .
a combined sea , air and amphibious assault by marines and naval special forces comes to mind , but it would be a delicate and complex affair to orchestrate , plan and execute on a battleground that could draw in international forces into an unwanted quagmire or at least a costly battle .
the potential for large scale civilian casualties would further exacerbate the chance for a disaster .
political will lacking to back use of force and not least political will may be lacking among some of the potential partners for a concerted use of force , where consensus would be necessary .
in short , if a deeper military solution would be attempted to shut down somalia 's pirate problem , it must be on a unified front , on a greater scale than piecemeal efforts and with sufficient , overwhelming force and resources .
but again when so much key intelligence gathering is lacking , any potential decisive campaign against the pirates is hampered by a lack of actionable knowledge .
poor intelligence analysis led to earlier international fiascos in somalia and the question of piracy poses as vexing a question to resolve as all else that ails somalia and its larger , chronic state as a failed nation without the effective rule of law or much hope for far too long .
for the present some of the most dangerous waters in the world off the horn of africa , will remain as treacherous as ever in 2010 precisely because somalia is still a hungry , desperate and violent place .

turkey says those arrested were suspected of having ties with kurdish separatists . news reports say eight protestors were hurt and a dozen others were arrested after clashes between kurdish protestors and turkish police .
the demonstrations were in response to last week 's arrest of kurdish officials with alleged ties to kurdish separatists .
clashes between masked youths and riot police broke out in the towns of hakkari and yuksekova , in southeastern turkey . two police officers are reported to be among the injured .
alleged ties to separatists last thursday , turkish police rounded up 31 people , including eight kurdish mayors , as part of its investigation into the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and its off-shoots .
earlier this month , the pro-kurdish democratic society party was banned from government for its alleged links to the pkk .
the pkk , which has been fighting an insurgency for kurdish independence since 1984 , is considered a terrorist organization by ankara and much of the international community .
the pkk 's fight with the turkish government has claimed roughly 45,000 lives .
kurdish protests have stepped up since october , first over the prison conditions of pkk founder abdullah ocalan , and more recently over the banning of the democratic society party .
turkey , in its bid to join the eu , has pledged reforms for the kurdish minority in the hope of easing tensions. mk / afp / ap editor : wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the evolution of piracy in somalia is inextricably linked to the collapse of somalia as a nation state , ravaged by conflict between rebels and government troops . the key pirate enclave is in northeastern somalia , in a region known as puntland where the pirates live as an autonomous presence .
among the five dominant seagoing criminal organizations based in somalia who generate revenues of between $ 100 to 150 million -lrb- 69 million to 104 million euros -rrb- a year , largely in ransom payments , many of the pirates were former clan fighters who discovered a far more lucrative form of armed capitalism .
others were mere humble fishermen who claim their livelihood has been lost to the industrial methods of international fishing fleets that indeed poach an estimated $ 300 million worth of fish a year from somali waters .
poverty , lack of development and hunger as ever are key factors for conflict , violence and brigandage in africa .
then there are the linkages to the outside world , the patrons , allies and benefactors , of what is a transnational business , so pirate arms come from yemen , much of the money is laundered in lebanon and there are other suspected but more opaque linkages in dubai .
however , the international community has not pierced the internal network linked to the pirate trail deeply and is lacking crucial access in terms of its intelligence gathering capacities within the secret structures that partner piracy .
limited military success against pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces managed to disrupt the pirates ' activities but their successes were few and far between where somalia 's pirates once confined themselves to the gulf of aden , they now launch raids and ship boarding as far away as the indian ocean on the kenyan coast .
there is un resolution 1838 in place authorizing lethal military force to curb or counter somalia 's pirates in international waters .
there is a multinational naval flotilla patrolling off the horn , combined task force 151 , that deploys warships , aircraft and naval special forces ship boarding parties , from european , us , and indian , russian and chinese contributors .
there have some successes scored by us and french special operations groups intercepting or eliminating pirates and freeing hostages and hijacked vessels , but with some 2000 miles -lrb- 3,218 km -rrb- of coast to secure , it amounts to a bathtub navy , although the squadron is a powerful one , that seldom can take a proactive approach or deter much .
but when the waterway under threat plays such a crucial strategic and mercantile role , and it is n't merely yachts that are captured or threatened but oil tankers , chemical ships , weapons bearing cargo ships and all manner of large civil vessels that are under threat , why have n't naval efforts been massively increased ?
moreover , when there are only an estimated 1,000 pirates concentrated mostly in a single coastal harbor town , why has n't the international community , as india has suggested , simply mounted a sharp amphibious assault ? to be sure there are some hawks and one former european military and intelligence officer who spoke to deusche welle anonymously said bluntly " what we need now is one short , sharp stroke and just take them out . " bildunterschrift : the un was often found lacking in its attempts to find a solution to the piracy issue the experience of the un peacekeeping mission and the ferocity of the fighting then and now , when somali violence reaches a crescendo , are cautiously remembered by many otherwise perhaps contemplating some sort of lethal strike , direct action in military terms against the pirates .
a combined sea , air and amphibious assault by marines and naval special forces comes to mind , but it would be a delicate and complex affair to orchestrate , plan and execute on a battleground that could draw in international forces into an unwanted quagmire or at least a costly battle .
the potential for large scale civilian casualties would further exacerbate the chance for a disaster .
political will lacking to back use of force and not least political will may be lacking among some of the potential partners for a concerted use of force , where consensus would be necessary .
in short , if a deeper military solution would be attempted to shut down somalia 's pirate problem , it must be on a unified front , on a greater scale than piecemeal efforts and with sufficient , overwhelming force and resources .
but again when so much key intelligence gathering is lacking , any potential decisive campaign against the pirates is hampered by a lack of actionable knowledge .
poor intelligence analysis led to earlier international fiascos in somalia and the question of piracy poses as vexing a question to resolve as all else that ails somalia and its larger , chronic state as a failed nation without the effective rule of law or much hope for far too long .
for the present some of the most dangerous waters in the world off the horn of africa , will remain as treacherous as ever in 2010 precisely because somalia is still a hungry , desperate and violent place .

in short , if a deeper military solution would be attempted to shut down somalia 's pirate problem , it must be on a unified front , on a greater scale than piecemeal efforts and with sufficient , overwhelming force and resources .
but again when so much key intelligence gathering is lacking , any potential decisive campaign against the pirates is hampered by a lack of actionable knowledge .
poor intelligence analysis led to earlier international fiascos in somalia and the question of piracy poses as vexing a question to resolve as all else that ails somalia and its larger , chronic state as a failed nation without the effective rule of law or much hope for far too long .
for the present some of the most dangerous waters in the world off the horn of africa , will remain as treacherous as ever in 2010 precisely because somalia is still a hungry , desperate and violent place .

he proposes an independent ratings agency to alert users to these risks . germany 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information peter schaar has warned that many social networking sites still have n't totally gotten on board with protecting users ' data .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , schaar specifically mentioned facebook , the largest of such sites , and its recent changes to its privacy settings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar wants social networking sites to do more to protect users ' information the default of the new setup puts everyone at the weakest privacy level , making their personal information and uploaded photos public .
while users did have to accept the changes , schaar still considers this to be user protection " unfriendly . "
" you press ' next ' and then suddenly you 've made your information totally available without the original access restrictions , " he said .
privacy advocates in the us have filed complaints with the federal trade commission over the new changes and have called on facebook to restore the old settings .
independent evaluation schaar told dpa he 's not against social networks in general .
" what 's important to me , " he said , " is that people are aware of what they 're doing , what information they 're putting on the internet and the problems associated with certain activities . "
it can be difficult to encourage companies like facebook that are based outside of germany to change their policies , schaar said .
he added that cooperation at the international level will be necessary to combat the problem of lax data protection rules .
in particular , schaar suggested the establishment of an independent consumer protection agency that could evaluate social networks , giving them grades on their privacy policies and let user know which sites protected them the best .
such an agency was part of the coalition agreement between chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and their coalition partners the free democrats. hf / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 27.12.2009 somalia-based piracy remains an intractable problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have been a bane to western shipping companies it 's impossible to consider somalia 's pirates in a vacuum .
the evolution of piracy in somalia is inextricably linked to the collapse of somalia as a nation state , ravaged by conflict between rebels and government troops . the key pirate enclave is in northeastern somalia , in a region known as puntland where the pirates live as an autonomous presence .
among the five dominant seagoing criminal organizations based in somalia who generate revenues of between $ 100 to 150 million -lrb- 69 million to 104 million euros -rrb- a year , largely in ransom payments , many of the pirates were former clan fighters who discovered a far more lucrative form of armed capitalism .
others were mere humble fishermen who claim their livelihood has been lost to the industrial methods of international fishing fleets that indeed poach an estimated $ 300 million worth of fish a year from somali waters .
poverty , lack of development and hunger as ever are key factors for conflict , violence and brigandage in africa .
then there are the linkages to the outside world , the patrons , allies and benefactors , of what is a transnational business , so pirate arms come from yemen , much of the money is laundered in lebanon and there are other suspected but more opaque linkages in dubai .
however , the international community has not pierced the internal network linked to the pirate trail deeply and is lacking crucial access in terms of its intelligence gathering capacities within the secret structures that partner piracy .
limited military success against pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international forces managed to disrupt the pirates ' activities but their successes were few and far between where somalia 's pirates once confined themselves to the gulf of aden , they now launch raids and ship boarding as far away as the indian ocean on the kenyan coast .
there is un resolution 1838 in place authorizing lethal military force to curb or counter somalia 's pirates in international waters .
there is a multinational naval flotilla patrolling off the horn , combined task force 151 , that deploys warships , aircraft and naval special forces ship boarding parties , from european , us , and indian , russian and chinese contributors .
there have some successes scored by us and french special operations groups intercepting or eliminating pirates and freeing hostages and hijacked vessels , but with some 2000 miles -lrb- 3,218 km -rrb- of coast to secure , it amounts to a bathtub navy , although the squadron is a powerful one , that seldom can take a proactive approach or deter much .
but when the waterway under threat plays such a crucial strategic and mercantile role , and it is n't merely yachts that are captured or threatened but oil tankers , chemical ships , weapons bearing cargo ships and all manner of large civil vessels that are under threat , why have n't naval efforts been massively increased ?
moreover , when there are only an estimated 1,000 pirates concentrated mostly in a single coastal harbor town , why has n't the international community , as india has suggested , simply mounted a sharp amphibious assault ? to be sure there are some hawks and one former european military and intelligence officer who spoke to deusche welle anonymously said bluntly " what we need now is one short , sharp stroke and just take them out . " bildunterschrift : the un was often found lacking in its attempts to find a solution to the piracy issue the experience of the un peacekeeping mission and the ferocity of the fighting then and now , when somali violence reaches a crescendo , are cautiously remembered by many otherwise perhaps contemplating some sort of lethal strike , direct action in military terms against the pirates .
a combined sea , air and amphibious assault by marines and naval special forces comes to mind , but it would be a delicate and complex affair to orchestrate , plan and execute on a battleground that could draw in international forces into an unwanted quagmire or at least a costly battle .
the potential for large scale civilian casualties would further exacerbate the chance for a disaster .
political will lacking to back use of force and not least political will may be lacking among some of the potential partners for a concerted use of force , where consensus would be necessary .
in short , if a deeper military solution would be attempted to shut down somalia 's pirate problem , it must be on a unified front , on a greater scale than piecemeal efforts and with sufficient , overwhelming force and resources .
but again when so much key intelligence gathering is lacking , any potential decisive campaign against the pirates is hampered by a lack of actionable knowledge .

turkey says those arrested were suspected of having ties with kurdish separatists . news reports say eight protestors were hurt and a dozen others were arrested after clashes between kurdish protestors and turkish police .
the demonstrations were in response to last week 's arrest of kurdish officials with alleged ties to kurdish separatists .
clashes between masked youths and riot police broke out in the towns of hakkari and yuksekova , in southeastern turkey . two police officers are reported to be among the injured .
alleged ties to separatists last thursday , turkish police rounded up 31 people , including eight kurdish mayors , as part of its investigation into the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- and its off-shoots .
earlier this month , the pro-kurdish democratic society party was banned from government for its alleged links to the pkk .
the pkk , which has been fighting an insurgency for kurdish independence since 1984 , is considered a terrorist organization by ankara and much of the international community .
the pkk 's fight with the turkish government has claimed roughly 45,000 lives .
kurdish protests have stepped up since october , first over the prison conditions of pkk founder abdullah ocalan , and more recently over the banning of the democratic society party .

the evolution of piracy in somalia is inextricably linked to the collapse of somalia as a nation state , ravaged by conflict between rebels and government troops . the key pirate enclave is in northeastern somalia , in a region known as puntland where the pirates live as an autonomous presence .
among the five dominant seagoing criminal organizations based in somalia who generate revenues of between $ 100 to 150 million -lrb- 69 million to 104 million euros -rrb- a year , largely in ransom payments , many of the pirates were former clan fighters who discovered a far more lucrative form of armed capitalism .

there is a multinational naval flotilla patrolling off the horn , combined task force 151 , that deploys warships , aircraft and naval special forces ship boarding parties , from european , us , and indian , russian and chinese contributors .
there have some successes scored by us and french special operations groups intercepting or eliminating pirates and freeing hostages and hijacked vessels , but with some 2000 miles -lrb- 3,218 km -rrb- of coast to secure , it amounts to a bathtub navy , although the squadron is a powerful one , that seldom can take a proactive approach or deter much .
but when the waterway under threat plays such a crucial strategic and mercantile role , and it is n't merely yachts that are captured or threatened but oil tankers , chemical ships , weapons bearing cargo ships and all manner of large civil vessels that are under threat , why have n't naval efforts been massively increased ?
moreover , when there are only an estimated 1,000 pirates concentrated mostly in a single coastal harbor town , why has n't the international community , as india has suggested , simply mounted a sharp amphibious assault ? to be sure there are some hawks and one former european military and intelligence officer who spoke to deusche welle anonymously said bluntly " what we need now is one short , sharp stroke and just take them out .

he proposes an independent ratings agency to alert users to these risks . germany 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information peter schaar has warned that many social networking sites still have n't totally gotten on board with protecting users ' data .
in an interview with german news agency dpa , schaar specifically mentioned facebook , the largest of such sites , and its recent changes to its privacy settings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaar wants social networking sites to do more to protect users ' information the default of the new setup puts everyone at the weakest privacy level , making their personal information and uploaded photos public .
while users did have to accept the changes , schaar still considers this to be user protection " unfriendly . "
" you press ' next ' and then suddenly you 've made your information totally available without the original access restrictions , " he said .
privacy advocates in the us have filed complaints with the federal trade commission over the new changes and have called on facebook to restore the old settings .
independent evaluation schaar told dpa he 's not against social networks in general .
" what 's important to me , " he said , " is that people are aware of what they 're doing , what information they 're putting on the internet and the problems associated with certain activities . "
it can be difficult to encourage companies like facebook that are based outside of germany to change their policies , schaar said .
he added that cooperation at the international level will be necessary to combat the problem of lax data protection rules .
in particular , schaar suggested the establishment of an independent consumer protection agency that could evaluate social networks , giving them grades on their privacy policies and let user know which sites protected them the best .
such an agency was part of the coalition agreement between chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and their coalition partners the free democrats. hf / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lasting peace in the war-ravaged country could only be achieved , he added , if moderate taliban members were allowed to participate in afghanistan 's democracy .
" because we are in a country with such regional diversity , " guttenberg told the paper , " we ca n't just leave out an entire ethnic group like the pashtuns if we want sustainable solutions for the future . "
certain conditions would need to be fulfilled , however , and it would be unacceptable for the afghan government to ignore universal human rights .
" we must ask ourselves who from the insurgents poses a serious threat to the international community and who is more concerned with the conditions in afghanistan itself , " he said .
" this issue of human rights must also be taken into account , without ignoring the existing cultures and traditions in afghanistan . "
guttenberg has in the past week indicated a willingness to engage in peace talks with non-terrorist taliban members , marking a change in german policy. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
