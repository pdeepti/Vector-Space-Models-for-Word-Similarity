that could mean the withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops from the republic which has suffered two separatist wars in the past 15 years . the cancellation was ordered by russian president dmitry medvedev and took effect thursday morning , according to a statement from the national anti-terrorist committee .
a spokesman for the committee , which has responsibility for the region , said the decision is aimed at further normalizing the situation there , and restoring and developing its economic and social infrastructure .
restrictions such as curfews , roadblocks , spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in chechnya in 1999 when russia sent troops to the region to end the north caucasus republic 's short-lived independence , which it won in an earlier war with moscow . critics say the special regime , which also includes restricted access for journalists , has fostered huge violations of human rights .
over the past 10 years the pro-moscow regional administration led by former rebel ramzan kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance . kadyrov says chechnya today is stable and has put behind it the violence which claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994 .
kadyrov has long wanted to ease both the restrictions and slacken moscow 's grip on the region .
russia has already withdrawn most of its army units from chechnya but tens of thousands of police from other russian regions and scores of special service units still patrol there .
interior ministry spokesman col. vasily panchenkov said last month that ending the regime could lead to the withdrawal of about 20,000 ministry troops from chechnya .
but panchenkov said at least one interior ministry brigade and a division of military troops would remain in the republic . mll / ncy , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its new insignia model is also selling well and has been voted european car of the year for 2009 . news media in the united states are reporting that general motors could file for bankruptcy as early as may .
this means that it would be extremely important for opel to be able to stand alone before gm files for “ chapter 11 ” bankruptcy protection in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel visited opel employees at the end of march moves to save opel have advanced considerably .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said he will travel to the gulf region in may , fueling speculation that one of the gulf emirates may take a stake in the carmaker . guttenberg also said that the us and germany were looking at all the options .
“ in a conversation with the us treasury secretary , " the german minister said " we agreed to set up an informal working group to discuss the next steps to be taken . ” debt for patents according to insiders , those steps could include a swap of opel patents for gm debt .
in an extraordinary meeting last friday , opel 's board of directors reportedly reached an agreement , which german public broadcaster ard described as a " lifeboat " for the ruesselsheim-based company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers are convinced they would be better off without gm opel could demand hundreds of millions of dollars from gm for selling technologies to it in 2005 , analysts say , and that would push the us automaker even closer to the brink . instead , the “ lifeboat ” solution means opel would now get back its patents , which are currently in the hands of the us government , and retract its financial demands . this , in turn , would substantially lower gm ’ s debt , making it more interesting to potential investors , while giving opel the tools it needs to continue building cars on its own . jobs better than unemployment german finance minister peer steinbrueck has argued that it makes more sense to save the company and the jobs than to put people out of work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open arms for abu dhabi ?
finance minister peer steinbrueck is looking for investors “ we ’ re talking about 25,000 or 26,000 employees and the same number with the suppliers , plus their families , " steinbrueck said .
" unemployment benefits for them would cost between two and three billion euros .
so , wouldn ’ t it make more sense to keep these people employed ? ” analysts say that part of a solution to gm 's problems could mean breaking up the automaker into separate " good " and " bad " components .
opel and swedish carmaker saab , as “ good ” components , would become independent with only a minority gm stake .
for the “ bad ” , this means phasing out ailing brands , like oldsmobile , and maintaining more successful ones , like chevrolet . “ all we need now , ” says klaus franz , the head of opel ’ s works council , “ is enough time to create an opel-europe . ” gb / pfd , ard / reuters / afp / glp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its new insignia model is also selling well and has been voted european car of the year for 2009 . news media in the united states are reporting that general motors could file for bankruptcy as early as may .
this means that it would be extremely important for opel to be able to stand alone before gm files for “ chapter 11 ” bankruptcy protection in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel visited opel employees at the end of march moves to save opel have advanced considerably .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said he will travel to the gulf region in may , fueling speculation that one of the gulf emirates may take a stake in the carmaker . guttenberg also said that the us and germany were looking at all the options .
“ in a conversation with the us treasury secretary , " the german minister said " we agreed to set up an informal working group to discuss the next steps to be taken . ” debt for patents according to insiders , those steps could include a swap of opel patents for gm debt .
in an extraordinary meeting last friday , opel 's board of directors reportedly reached an agreement , which german public broadcaster ard described as a " lifeboat " for the ruesselsheim-based company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers are convinced they would be better off without gm opel could demand hundreds of millions of dollars from gm for selling technologies to it in 2005 , analysts say , and that would push the us automaker even closer to the brink . instead , the “ lifeboat ” solution means opel would now get back its patents , which are currently in the hands of the us government , and retract its financial demands . this , in turn , would substantially lower gm ’ s debt , making it more interesting to potential investors , while giving opel the tools it needs to continue building cars on its own . jobs better than unemployment german finance minister peer steinbrueck has argued that it makes more sense to save the company and the jobs than to put people out of work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open arms for abu dhabi ?
finance minister peer steinbrueck is looking for investors “ we ’ re talking about 25,000 or 26,000 employees and the same number with the suppliers , plus their families , " steinbrueck said .
" unemployment benefits for them would cost between two and three billion euros .
so , wouldn ’ t it make more sense to keep these people employed ? ” analysts say that part of a solution to gm 's problems could mean breaking up the automaker into separate " good " and " bad " components .
opel and swedish carmaker saab , as “ good ” components , would become independent with only a minority gm stake .
for the “ bad ” , this means phasing out ailing brands , like oldsmobile , and maintaining more successful ones , like chevrolet . “ all we need now , ” says klaus franz , the head of opel ’ s works council , “ is enough time to create an opel-europe . ” gb / pfd , ard / reuters / afp / glp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move will delay his deportation to germany for trial by at least one week . the appeals court asked the justice department to detail its plans to transport the 89-year-old retired auto worker .
the court also demanded the state provide " the report of the doctor which forms the basis for its conclusion that the petitioner 's medical condition is such that he is stable enough to travel safely . "
german authorities allege that the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , then 23 , worked for seven months in 1943 as a guard at the sobibor concentration camp in poland .
at least 29,000 jews died at the camp during that time .
prosecutors in munich issued an arrest warrant for him three weeks ago .
however the us court of appeals in cincinnati , ohio , granted demjanjuk a stay on his deportation order on tuesday , april 14 , hours after federal agents removed him from his home in the cleveland suburb of seven hills in anticipation of sending him to germany .
demjanjuk has maintained his innocence of all charges .
he says he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
german resignation the stayed deportation has thrown a spotlight on the deference of many germans towards the case .
more than 60 years since the end of world war ii , which few alive lived through , the desire to see nazi era war criminals face justice is still present .
but according to bernd wagner from berlin 's center for democratic culture , demjanjuk is largely viewed as just one cog in a complex machine that spread horror throughout europe , and which is slowly fading to the recesses of german public consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 89-year-old is alleged to have worked in a nazi concentration camp wagner said the current generation of young germans were less emotional about world war ii than their parents and felt the country needed to move on from its troubled history .
" there 's a widely held view we should draw a line under this chapter of the past , " wagner told news agency reuters .
trial questioned demjanjuk 's lawyers are arguing that he is too ill to stand trial and that his medical condition would worsen in incarceration .
this has led many in germany to question the purpose his trial would serve , klaus-peter schoeppner , head of pollsters emnid , told reuters .
" the share of germans who , in the third generation , want to draw a line under the past and not deal with the guilt question all the time has increased massively over past years , " schoeppner said .
however , this has not swayed german authorities , who feel that if demjanjuk is judged fit to stand trial then he should be made to do so .
" this is not about revenge but about clearing things up and justice , " a spokesman for the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats said .

the move will delay his deportation to germany for trial by at least one week . the appeals court asked the justice department to detail its plans to transport the 89-year-old retired auto worker .
the court also demanded the state provide " the report of the doctor which forms the basis for its conclusion that the petitioner 's medical condition is such that he is stable enough to travel safely . "
german authorities allege that the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , then 23 , worked for seven months in 1943 as a guard at the sobibor concentration camp in poland .
at least 29,000 jews died at the camp during that time .
prosecutors in munich issued an arrest warrant for him three weeks ago .
however the us court of appeals in cincinnati , ohio , granted demjanjuk a stay on his deportation order on tuesday , april 14 , hours after federal agents removed him from his home in the cleveland suburb of seven hills in anticipation of sending him to germany .
demjanjuk has maintained his innocence of all charges .
he says he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
german resignation the stayed deportation has thrown a spotlight on the deference of many germans towards the case .
more than 60 years since the end of world war ii , which few alive lived through , the desire to see nazi era war criminals face justice is still present .
but according to bernd wagner from berlin 's center for democratic culture , demjanjuk is largely viewed as just one cog in a complex machine that spread horror throughout europe , and which is slowly fading to the recesses of german public consciousness .

the organization went to great lengths to explain that the loss did not arise from exposure to toxic assets .
in 2007 it recorded a net profit of 2.49 billion euros .
" we have no toxic assets , " cdc 's chief executive officer , augustin de romanet , told reporters on thursday , adding that " the auditors have confirmed that . "
when asked about the influence of the new government sovereign wealth fund fsi on his company , de romanet said : " the fsi was n't imposed upon us ; it subscribed to the expansion of the mission " of cdc , which is to support the french economy .
the cdc receives regulatory deposits from the french government and acts as an investment arm for long-term policy .
the bank said it had set aside 2.082 billion euros for its 17.6-percent holding in franco-belgian financial house dexia and for its 20.1-percent interest in french civil engineering group eiffage .
it also said it had laid out 921 million euros for its portfolio of shares .
the belgian and french governments , as well as cdc , contributed to a 6.4 billion-euro bailout of dexia late last year .
de romanet said he was " very confident " about dexia 's prospects . dfm / pfd , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report also said that couples would be entitled to a 600-euro bonus and that all 30 million german taxpayers would be eligible for the payment .
around three billion euros - to be taken from a new stock exchange tax - would be made available for the bonus scheme .
an spd spokesman described the reports on thursday as speculation and said that no firm decisions had been taken on the matter .
plan hosed down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen trittin has labeled the plan an expensive gift but the plan has already been talked down by opposition politicians keen to snuff out early spd campaigning for the upcoming federal election .
fdp general-secretary dirk niebel labeled the scheme as typically socialist , while his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said it would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the chairman of the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would only complicate people 's taxes , labeling it " the worst form of rip off . "
the green party 's leading candidate for the bundestag elections , juergen trittin , criticized the plan for being what he described as an expensive gift .
" the money would be more sensibly used to reduce social security contributions , " he said .
the bundestag elections are to be held in september .

the report also said that couples would be entitled to a 600-euro bonus and that all 30 million german taxpayers would be eligible for the payment .
around three billion euros - to be taken from a new stock exchange tax - would be made available for the bonus scheme .
an spd spokesman described the reports on thursday as speculation and said that no firm decisions had been taken on the matter .
plan hosed down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen trittin has labeled the plan an expensive gift but the plan has already been talked down by opposition politicians keen to snuff out early spd campaigning for the upcoming federal election .
fdp general-secretary dirk niebel labeled the scheme as typically socialist , while his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said it would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the chairman of the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would only complicate people 's taxes , labeling it " the worst form of rip off . "
the green party 's leading candidate for the bundestag elections , juergen trittin , criticized the plan for being what he described as an expensive gift .

the call was made during his meeting with the visiting us special envoy to the middle east , george mitchell . similar demands have been made of the palestinian authority in the past , but the body says it will only recognize israel as it existed before 1967 , prior to the jewish state seizing control of the west bank and gaza strip in the six day war .
meanwhile , stark differences between us and israeli policies emerged during the first meeting between president barack obama 's middle east envoy and the new israeli leadership which took office in late march .
special envoy george mitchell made it clear washington is aiming for the creation of a palestinian state .
" us policy favors , with respect to the israeli-palestinian conflict , a two-state solution , " mitchell told reporters in jerusalem on thursday .
new tack needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli president shimon peres also met with envoy george mitchell in contrast , israeli officials steered clear of the question of palestinian statehood .
netanyahu said only that the west bank 's economy must first improve before any other steps towards peace can be taken .
new israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman observed that past israeli concessions have led to violence , not peace .
lieberman told reporters that the peace process with the palestinians " had reached a dead end " and that new ideas must be found .
" the traditional approach has so far led to no solutions or results , " lieberman said .
mitchell is expected to travel to the west bank for talks with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas of the fatah party and other officials on friday .
more rocket fire israeli aircraft bombed a house in the gaza strip on thursday - the first strike in more than a month on the densely populated area .
no casualties were reported .
the raid came one day after gaza militants fired a rocket into southern israel .
both israel and the palestinian militant group hamas have failed to observe the ceasefires they announced in mid january to end a deadly 22-day war .
according to a palestinian rights group , nearly 1 , 500 palestinians , including 926 civilians , were killed in the fighting .
israel , however , disputes those figures . cg / pfd , dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organization went to great lengths to explain that the loss did not arise from exposure to toxic assets .
in 2007 it recorded a net profit of 2.49 billion euros .
" we have no toxic assets , " cdc 's chief executive officer , augustin de romanet , told reporters on thursday , adding that " the auditors have confirmed that . "
when asked about the influence of the new government sovereign wealth fund fsi on his company , de romanet said : " the fsi was n't imposed upon us ; it subscribed to the expansion of the mission " of cdc , which is to support the french economy .
the cdc receives regulatory deposits from the french government and acts as an investment arm for long-term policy .
the bank said it had set aside 2.082 billion euros for its 17.6-percent holding in franco-belgian financial house dexia and for its 20.1-percent interest in french civil engineering group eiffage .
it also said it had laid out 921 million euros for its portfolio of shares .
the belgian and french governments , as well as cdc , contributed to a 6.4 billion-euro bailout of dexia late last year .
de romanet said he was " very confident " about dexia 's prospects . dfm / pfd , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
that 's when a designer in germany discovered a booming market for modern , urban clothes and accessories with a muslim message . people from many different cultures are likely to agree : slippers are rather uncool .
but in styleislam 's fashion design office , everyone walks around in them .
here , in the small german town of witten in the middle of the industrial ruhr region , chic clothes and accessories are designed for fashion-conscious but devout young muslims . styleislam was the brainchild of melih kesmen , a stocky man with a ponytail and goatee . " here are a few examples of our designs , like one about the hijab - the headscarf , " he said , pulling a black handbag out of a cupboard in the company 's small stockroom . " hijab , my right , my choice , my life , " is written on the bag in big white letters . " if a woman wants to wear a headscarf , then she should be allowed to , " said kesmen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if women want to wear headscarves , they should , says kesmen the motto on the bag could provoke hours of discussion , and so could plenty of other motifs on the entrepreneur 's shelves , such as baby bibs printed with the word " minimuslim " or a call to prayer : " salah , always get connected . " a different kind of response the project began three years ago , as the scandal raged over caricatures of the prophet muhammad printed in a danish newspaper .
at the time , kesmen was living in london with his wife yeliz . " the publication of the drawings bothered me , but i was also really annoyed by the reaction from our side , the muslim side , " said kesmen .
in many muslim countries around the world , violent demonstrations were held and danish flags were burned . " so i thought , there must be a way to respond creatively and productively , in a peaceful way , " added kesmen .

while team obama is officially on a mission to create a new dialogue between the northern and southern parts of the american continent , one issue in particular is likely to dominate proceedings : cuba .
when it comes to us relations with latin america , cuba is always the elephant in the room .
despite not actually being in the room – cuba has not been invited to friday 's gathering – ending the long-standing enmity between washington and havana and the 47-year-old us economic embargo is expected to be the issue on everyone 's lips .
this is true before the summit has even started .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , who has developed close personal ties with cuba 's ruling castro brothers and has long sought to limit us influence in latin america , made it clear he would push cuba 's case at the summit .
" why is cuba not at the summit of the americas ? " he asked on monday .
" this is one of the main questions that from now on will resonate in trinidad . "
chavez said he would " demand that the empire -lrb- the united states -rrb- run by obama lift the blockade on cuba . "
ecuadorian president rafael correa also indicated that he would use part of his five-minute speech at the summit to blast the embargo .
cuba , he said , " can not continue to be excluded from the inter-american system – that 's barbaric . "
white house officials expect a certain amount of dialogue on cuba but they hope that more time at the summit will be devoted to their own aim of setting a new tone for relations between the united states and latin america .
washington would much rather concentrate on economic reforms , renewable energy , public safety and the fight against drug trafficking – not to mention measures to tackle the global economic crisis .
but if obama and his team arrive hoping that the summit is not distracted by the cuban issue , they are likely to have those hopes dashed .
traditional enmity over us power and influence while it remains to be seen whether this summit will produce the kind of clashes provoked during george w. bush 's tenure , many observers believe that obama is about to find out just how far his enormous goodwill and popularity in most of latin america will stretch – and cuba may just be the snapping point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castros have the support of the majority of latin america " the cuba issue is very important to latin american societies , " tom carothers , the vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , told deutsche welle .
" it 's a symbolic issue , which represents the continuation of the traditional image of the us standing on the neck of some latin american governments .
so it sets a tone that inhibits the united states ' position in the region . "
the cuba issue was high on the agenda when latin american and caribbean nations met at a summit in brazil in december where they agreed the ongoing embargo against cuba was unjust and unnecessary , and should go .
this is a regional attitude that has not been lost on the new president .
obama attempted to defuse tensions on cuba and moved to calm the region in general by announcing earlier this week that he was lifting curbs on travel and money transfers by cuban-americans to the communist-ruled island .
" i think the obama administration correctly perceived that by making an announcement a week before the summit that they 're really starting a process of positive change in us relations with cuba , " carothers said .
" the americans hope to send a signal to governments and people in latin america that they would like to reposition the us much more generally in the region .
us will only go so far without cuban incentives , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing travel to cuba is a first step in the new us policy " i think the us is ready to go quite far if it gets some positive response from cuba , " carothers added .
" already they have , to some extent , put the ball in the court of the castros , although the cuban government might not feel that way yet .
but the region is now curious , turning its attention to the cuban government and saying ' now you have a positive signal from the united states , what 's your reaction ? '
so this is a change after 50 years of the region waiting for the united states to make a move . "
but while the new administration may have extended a hand , experts believe a full embrace is still some distance away .
washington remains unmoved on the issue of the embargo as long as cuba remains undemocratic and imprisons political dissidents .
on thursday , obama called on havana to send a signal that there will be " changes in how cuba operates " to prompt a thaw in relations , ahead of the summit .
he called for political prisoners to be released and free speech to be allowed in order to " see a further thawing of relations " between the us and its long-time communist foe .
" if the obama administration feels that it can get some positive reaction back from the cuban government , they could engage in a direct discussion , which might allow further steps , " carothers said .
" however , i think the administration is unlikely to take a further unilateral step to ease sanctions without getting at least something back from the other side . "
obama hoping to reverse eight years of perceived neglect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has already reached out to leaders like brazil 's lula whether obama 's step-by-step policy towards cuba will be enough to satisfy his critics in latin america remains to be seen .
the us president may have to offer concrete assurances on a number of other pressing issues if he is to convince his neighbors he 's offering ' change they can believe in . '
" this summit has a lot of economic and social issues to deal with , " tom carothers said .
" there is the global financial crisis which is both a common issue and also an issue of division , as the latin americans blame the us ; then there is the on-going desire to improve and deepen free trade in the region as well as the hope for more us involvement in the war on drugs and some us movement on immigration reform .
" but we should see this summit in a broader context , " he added .
" we have a new american president trying to change the tone of relations and also change the impression in latin america that the united states has been neglecting the region for the last eight years . "

" the americans hope to send a signal to governments and people in latin america that they would like to reposition the us much more generally in the region .
us will only go so far without cuban incentives , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing travel to cuba is a first step in the new us policy " i think the us is ready to go quite far if it gets some positive response from cuba , " carothers added .
" already they have , to some extent , put the ball in the court of the castros , although the cuban government might not feel that way yet .
but the region is now curious , turning its attention to the cuban government and saying ' now you have a positive signal from the united states , what 's your reaction ? '
so this is a change after 50 years of the region waiting for the united states to make a move . "
but while the new administration may have extended a hand , experts believe a full embrace is still some distance away .
washington remains unmoved on the issue of the embargo as long as cuba remains undemocratic and imprisons political dissidents .
on thursday , obama called on havana to send a signal that there will be " changes in how cuba operates " to prompt a thaw in relations , ahead of the summit .
he called for political prisoners to be released and free speech to be allowed in order to " see a further thawing of relations " between the us and its long-time communist foe .
" if the obama administration feels that it can get some positive reaction back from the cuban government , they could engage in a direct discussion , which might allow further steps , " carothers said .
" however , i think the administration is unlikely to take a further unilateral step to ease sanctions without getting at least something back from the other side . "
obama hoping to reverse eight years of perceived neglect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has already reached out to leaders like brazil 's lula whether obama 's step-by-step policy towards cuba will be enough to satisfy his critics in latin america remains to be seen .
the us president may have to offer concrete assurances on a number of other pressing issues if he is to convince his neighbors he 's offering ' change they can believe in . '
" this summit has a lot of economic and social issues to deal with , " tom carothers said .
" there is the global financial crisis which is both a common issue and also an issue of division , as the latin americans blame the us ; then there is the on-going desire to improve and deepen free trade in the region as well as the hope for more us involvement in the war on drugs and some us movement on immigration reform .
" but we should see this summit in a broader context , " he added .
" we have a new american president trying to change the tone of relations and also change the impression in latin america that the united states has been neglecting the region for the last eight years . "

while team obama is officially on a mission to create a new dialogue between the northern and southern parts of the american continent , one issue in particular is likely to dominate proceedings : cuba .
when it comes to us relations with latin america , cuba is always the elephant in the room .
despite not actually being in the room – cuba has not been invited to friday 's gathering – ending the long-standing enmity between washington and havana and the 47-year-old us economic embargo is expected to be the issue on everyone 's lips .
this is true before the summit has even started .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , who has developed close personal ties with cuba 's ruling castro brothers and has long sought to limit us influence in latin america , made it clear he would push cuba 's case at the summit .
" why is cuba not at the summit of the americas ? " he asked on monday .
" this is one of the main questions that from now on will resonate in trinidad . "
chavez said he would " demand that the empire -lrb- the united states -rrb- run by obama lift the blockade on cuba . "
ecuadorian president rafael correa also indicated that he would use part of his five-minute speech at the summit to blast the embargo .
cuba , he said , " can not continue to be excluded from the inter-american system – that 's barbaric . "
white house officials expect a certain amount of dialogue on cuba but they hope that more time at the summit will be devoted to their own aim of setting a new tone for relations between the united states and latin america .
washington would much rather concentrate on economic reforms , renewable energy , public safety and the fight against drug trafficking – not to mention measures to tackle the global economic crisis .
but if obama and his team arrive hoping that the summit is not distracted by the cuban issue , they are likely to have those hopes dashed .
traditional enmity over us power and influence while it remains to be seen whether this summit will produce the kind of clashes provoked during george w. bush 's tenure , many observers believe that obama is about to find out just how far his enormous goodwill and popularity in most of latin america will stretch – and cuba may just be the snapping point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castros have the support of the majority of latin america " the cuba issue is very important to latin american societies , " tom carothers , the vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , told deutsche welle .
" it 's a symbolic issue , which represents the continuation of the traditional image of the us standing on the neck of some latin american governments .
so it sets a tone that inhibits the united states ' position in the region . "
the cuba issue was high on the agenda when latin american and caribbean nations met at a summit in brazil in december where they agreed the ongoing embargo against cuba was unjust and unnecessary , and should go .
this is a regional attitude that has not been lost on the new president .
obama attempted to defuse tensions on cuba and moved to calm the region in general by announcing earlier this week that he was lifting curbs on travel and money transfers by cuban-americans to the communist-ruled island .

" this summit has a lot of economic and social issues to deal with , " tom carothers said .
" there is the global financial crisis which is both a common issue and also an issue of division , as the latin americans blame the us ; then there is the on-going desire to improve and deepen free trade in the region as well as the hope for more us involvement in the war on drugs and some us movement on immigration reform .

the organization went to great lengths to explain that the loss did not arise from exposure to toxic assets .
in 2007 it recorded a net profit of 2.49 billion euros .
" we have no toxic assets , " cdc 's chief executive officer , augustin de romanet , told reporters on thursday , adding that " the auditors have confirmed that . "
when asked about the influence of the new government sovereign wealth fund fsi on his company , de romanet said : " the fsi was n't imposed upon us ; it subscribed to the expansion of the mission " of cdc , which is to support the french economy .
the cdc receives regulatory deposits from the french government and acts as an investment arm for long-term policy .
the bank said it had set aside 2.082 billion euros for its 17.6-percent holding in franco-belgian financial house dexia and for its 20.1-percent interest in french civil engineering group eiffage .
it also said it had laid out 921 million euros for its portfolio of shares .
the belgian and french governments , as well as cdc , contributed to a 6.4 billion-euro bailout of dexia late last year .

germany 's two remaining international sides have excellent chances in thursday 's uefa cup matches , having both won their first-leg games .
but if they progress , they 'll meet each other . if the two teams both do advance to the semifinals , it will mean germany is guaranteed a spot in the uefa cup final in istanbul on may 20 .
and such a match-up would be all the more of a treat since the two northern german sides are also local rivals with no love lost .
but for that scenario to come to pass , both teams need to close the deal on the road - hamburg against english premier side manchester city , and bremen versus italian serie a competitors udinese .
bremen should be fairly confident , as their italian opponents are languishing in 12th place in their domestic league .
but werder are only tenth in the bundesliga , and their talented brazilian playmaker diego is touch-and-go ahead of the clash in italy .
what 's more , coach thomas schaaf will have to hope that his inconsistent defense has one of its better evenings .

still , the northern germans have been difficult to score against in all competitions this season so there 's no reason why they should n't prevail in manchester .

the two rivals meet for a league match next week and clash again in the semifinals of the german cup on may 10 .

germany 's two remaining international sides have excellent chances in thursday 's uefa cup matches , having both won their first-leg games .
but if they progress , they 'll meet each other . if the two teams both do advance to the semifinals , it will mean germany is guaranteed a spot in the uefa cup final in istanbul on may 20 .
and such a match-up would be all the more of a treat since the two northern german sides are also local rivals with no love lost .
but for that scenario to come to pass , both teams need to close the deal on the road - hamburg against english premier side manchester city , and bremen versus italian serie a competitors udinese .
bremen should be fairly confident , as their italian opponents are languishing in 12th place in their domestic league .
but werder are only tenth in the bundesliga , and their talented brazilian playmaker diego is touch-and-go ahead of the clash in italy .
what 's more , coach thomas schaaf will have to hope that his inconsistent defense has one of its better evenings .
getting to know you bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... and werder bremen in the uefa cup hamburg , with the third-best record in the germany , will also fancy their chances against man city , who are currently in eleventh place in the premier league .
coach martin jol has no serious injury worries , although hamburg should be aware that city do have a very good home record .
still , the northern germans have been difficult to score against in all competitions this season so there 's no reason why they should n't prevail in manchester .
and even if bremen or hamburg or both should falter on thursday evening , they 'll still be seeing a bit of one another in the coming weeks .
the two rivals meet for a league match next week and clash again in the semifinals of the german cup on may 10 .

the patent would protect the breeding of pigs that possess a naturally occurring gene linked to rapid growth .
some 400 protesters parked tractors and herded pigs outside the european patent office in the german city of munich on wednesday .
they also filed an appeal seeking to overturn a 2005 patent application -lrb- patent ep 1651777 -rrb- filed by us biotech giant monsanto , and now owned by newsham choice genetics .
the patent aims to protect a pig breeding process based on genetic analysis .
but critics warn that the patent could be extended to cover the animals ' genes themselves , and farmers fear that they could one day be forced to pay royalties for their traditional livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european patent office is under to pressure to ban animal breeding patents the german states of bavaria and hesse also oppose the patent application and have already signaled their intention to introduce a general ban on all patents covering animals and plants .
the head of the german farming association , gerd sonnleitner , told the passauer neue presse newspaper that the patent was a " threat to free breeding . "
" patents on animals and plants should be generally banned , because it contradicts every basic understanding of farming , that individuals should have monopoly rights on genetic material , " sonnleitner said .
" corporations are always trying to bypass the regulations to achieve access to animals and plants .
for this reason all legal loopholes should be closed at the eu level so large companies do not dictate what is bred and what lands up on consumers ' plates , " he added .
the farmers ' association president also called for more research into so-called green biotechnologies to investigate the risks and opportunities involved . nt / nw , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says germany must have known of the unsatisfactory prison conditions in kenya . ali mohamed a.d. was captured by the german navy patrolling the gulf of aden last month when he allegedly tried to seize a freighter , the mv courier .
he was transferred to kenya along with eight other somali suspects for prosecution in the port city of mombasa under an eu agreement with kenya .
his lawyer , oliver wallasch , said his client , who denies involvement in piracy , was seeking 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,300 -rrb- from the german government before the berlin regional court for damages incurred after his " unlawful " transfer to kenya .
the lawsuit contends that the interior , defense , justice and foreign ministries must have been aware that a suspect would likely have no access to medical treatment , sanitary facilities or privacy in a kenyan jail .
according to wallasch 's application to the court , as quoted by the website of german newspaper bild , " the plaintiff finds himself in a cell designed for four men .
however , he shares the cell with nine others . "
it said there was no privacy , and no account was taken of muslim dietary restrictions .
" vegetarian food is only available for medical reasons , so that the plaintiff is forced to eat pork if he is not to starve . "
the german foreign ministry denied that germany took no account of the human rights of alleged pirates . a spokesman said the government checked that standards were maintained .
meanwhile a second suspect , mohamud mohamed h. , has filed an injunction with the berlin administrative court aiming to force the german foreign ministry to cover the costs of a public defender in kenya .
his lawyer , andreas schulz , said his trial was to begin in mombasa on april 22 and he currently has no defense attorney there .
wallasch said another three suspected pirates had hired german lawyers .
kenya and the eu have signed an agreement under which suspected somali pirates who are detained in the course of the eu anti-piracy naval mission off the somali coast are transferred to kenya . a german ship , the hansa stavanger , is currently one of at least 18 ships held by somali pirates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.04.2009 international community mulls response to somalia 's piracy problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on the us maersk alabama brought the issue to a head with the escalation of piracy off the coast of somalia , the international community is pondering what action to take .
but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .
" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .

" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .

but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .

that could mean the withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops from the republic which has suffered two separatist wars in the past 15 years . the cancellation was ordered by russian president dmitry medvedev and took effect thursday morning , according to a statement from the national anti-terrorist committee .
a spokesman for the committee , which has responsibility for the region , said the decision is aimed at further normalizing the situation there , and restoring and developing its economic and social infrastructure .
restrictions such as curfews , roadblocks , spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in chechnya in 1999 when russia sent troops to the region to end the north caucasus republic 's short-lived independence , which it won in an earlier war with moscow . critics say the special regime , which also includes restricted access for journalists , has fostered huge violations of human rights .
over the past 10 years the pro-moscow regional administration led by former rebel ramzan kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance . kadyrov says chechnya today is stable and has put behind it the violence which claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994 .
kadyrov has long wanted to ease both the restrictions and slacken moscow 's grip on the region .
russia has already withdrawn most of its army units from chechnya but tens of thousands of police from other russian regions and scores of special service units still patrol there .
interior ministry spokesman col. vasily panchenkov said last month that ending the regime could lead to the withdrawal of about 20,000 ministry troops from chechnya .
but panchenkov said at least one interior ministry brigade and a division of military troops would remain in the republic . mll / ncy , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that could mean the withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops from the republic which has suffered two separatist wars in the past 15 years . the cancellation was ordered by russian president dmitry medvedev and took effect thursday morning , according to a statement from the national anti-terrorist committee .
a spokesman for the committee , which has responsibility for the region , said the decision is aimed at further normalizing the situation there , and restoring and developing its economic and social infrastructure .
restrictions such as curfews , roadblocks , spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in chechnya in 1999 when russia sent troops to the region to end the north caucasus republic 's short-lived independence , which it won in an earlier war with moscow . critics say the special regime , which also includes restricted access for journalists , has fostered huge violations of human rights .
over the past 10 years the pro-moscow regional administration led by former rebel ramzan kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance . kadyrov says chechnya today is stable and has put behind it the violence which claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994 .

the call was made during his meeting with the visiting us special envoy to the middle east , george mitchell . similar demands have been made of the palestinian authority in the past , but the body says it will only recognize israel as it existed before 1967 , prior to the jewish state seizing control of the west bank and gaza strip in the six day war .
meanwhile , stark differences between us and israeli policies emerged during the first meeting between president barack obama 's middle east envoy and the new israeli leadership which took office in late march .
special envoy george mitchell made it clear washington is aiming for the creation of a palestinian state .
" us policy favors , with respect to the israeli-palestinian conflict , a two-state solution , " mitchell told reporters in jerusalem on thursday .
new tack needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli president shimon peres also met with envoy george mitchell in contrast , israeli officials steered clear of the question of palestinian statehood .
netanyahu said only that the west bank 's economy must first improve before any other steps towards peace can be taken .
new israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman observed that past israeli concessions have led to violence , not peace .
lieberman told reporters that the peace process with the palestinians " had reached a dead end " and that new ideas must be found .
" the traditional approach has so far led to no solutions or results , " lieberman said .
mitchell is expected to travel to the west bank for talks with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas of the fatah party and other officials on friday .
more rocket fire israeli aircraft bombed a house in the gaza strip on thursday - the first strike in more than a month on the densely populated area .
no casualties were reported .
the raid came one day after gaza militants fired a rocket into southern israel .
both israel and the palestinian militant group hamas have failed to observe the ceasefires they announced in mid january to end a deadly 22-day war .
according to a palestinian rights group , nearly 1 , 500 palestinians , including 926 civilians , were killed in the fighting .
israel , however , disputes those figures . cg / pfd , dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the call was made during his meeting with the visiting us special envoy to the middle east , george mitchell . similar demands have been made of the palestinian authority in the past , but the body says it will only recognize israel as it existed before 1967 , prior to the jewish state seizing control of the west bank and gaza strip in the six day war .
meanwhile , stark differences between us and israeli policies emerged during the first meeting between president barack obama 's middle east envoy and the new israeli leadership which took office in late march .
special envoy george mitchell made it clear washington is aiming for the creation of a palestinian state .
" us policy favors , with respect to the israeli-palestinian conflict , a two-state solution , " mitchell told reporters in jerusalem on thursday .
new tack needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli president shimon peres also met with envoy george mitchell in contrast , israeli officials steered clear of the question of palestinian statehood .
netanyahu said only that the west bank 's economy must first improve before any other steps towards peace can be taken .
new israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman observed that past israeli concessions have led to violence , not peace .
lieberman told reporters that the peace process with the palestinians " had reached a dead end " and that new ideas must be found .
" the traditional approach has so far led to no solutions or results , " lieberman said .
mitchell is expected to travel to the west bank for talks with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas of the fatah party and other officials on friday .
more rocket fire israeli aircraft bombed a house in the gaza strip on thursday - the first strike in more than a month on the densely populated area .
no casualties were reported .
the raid came one day after gaza militants fired a rocket into southern israel .
both israel and the palestinian militant group hamas have failed to observe the ceasefires they announced in mid january to end a deadly 22-day war .
according to a palestinian rights group , nearly 1 , 500 palestinians , including 926 civilians , were killed in the fighting .
israel , however , disputes those figures . cg / pfd , dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 16.04.2009 deportation of alleged nazi death camp guard demjanjuk delayed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's deportation is eagerly anticipated by german prosecutors a us court has asked for a medical report on alleged nazi death camp guard john demjanjuk .
the move will delay his deportation to germany for trial by at least one week . the appeals court asked the justice department to detail its plans to transport the 89-year-old retired auto worker .
the court also demanded the state provide " the report of the doctor which forms the basis for its conclusion that the petitioner 's medical condition is such that he is stable enough to travel safely . "
german authorities allege that the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , then 23 , worked for seven months in 1943 as a guard at the sobibor concentration camp in poland .
at least 29,000 jews died at the camp during that time .
prosecutors in munich issued an arrest warrant for him three weeks ago .
however the us court of appeals in cincinnati , ohio , granted demjanjuk a stay on his deportation order on tuesday , april 14 , hours after federal agents removed him from his home in the cleveland suburb of seven hills in anticipation of sending him to germany .
demjanjuk has maintained his innocence of all charges .
he says he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
german resignation the stayed deportation has thrown a spotlight on the deference of many germans towards the case .
more than 60 years since the end of world war ii , which few alive lived through , the desire to see nazi era war criminals face justice is still present .
but according to bernd wagner from berlin 's center for democratic culture , demjanjuk is largely viewed as just one cog in a complex machine that spread horror throughout europe , and which is slowly fading to the recesses of german public consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 89-year-old is alleged to have worked in a nazi concentration camp wagner said the current generation of young germans were less emotional about world war ii than their parents and felt the country needed to move on from its troubled history .
" there 's a widely held view we should draw a line under this chapter of the past , " wagner told news agency reuters .
trial questioned demjanjuk 's lawyers are arguing that he is too ill to stand trial and that his medical condition would worsen in incarceration .
this has led many in germany to question the purpose his trial would serve , klaus-peter schoeppner , head of pollsters emnid , told reuters .
" the share of germans who , in the third generation , want to draw a line under the past and not deal with the guilt question all the time has increased massively over past years , " schoeppner said .
however , this has not swayed german authorities , who feel that if demjanjuk is judged fit to stand trial then he should be made to do so .
" this is not about revenge but about clearing things up and justice , " a spokesman for the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats said .
" it is also a matter of working through our history . "
joerg van essen of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- said germany was still obligated to ensure that nazi era war criminals were brought to justice .
" if someone is fit , then age is no protection from punishment … every case makes clear our responsibility to make sure that something like this must never happen again , " he said . dfm / mrh , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move will delay his deportation to germany for trial by at least one week . the appeals court asked the justice department to detail its plans to transport the 89-year-old retired auto worker .
the court also demanded the state provide " the report of the doctor which forms the basis for its conclusion that the petitioner 's medical condition is such that he is stable enough to travel safely . "
german authorities allege that the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , then 23 , worked for seven months in 1943 as a guard at the sobibor concentration camp in poland .
at least 29,000 jews died at the camp during that time .
prosecutors in munich issued an arrest warrant for him three weeks ago .
however the us court of appeals in cincinnati , ohio , granted demjanjuk a stay on his deportation order on tuesday , april 14 , hours after federal agents removed him from his home in the cleveland suburb of seven hills in anticipation of sending him to germany .
demjanjuk has maintained his innocence of all charges .
he says he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
german resignation the stayed deportation has thrown a spotlight on the deference of many germans towards the case .
more than 60 years since the end of world war ii , which few alive lived through , the desire to see nazi era war criminals face justice is still present .
but according to bernd wagner from berlin 's center for democratic culture , demjanjuk is largely viewed as just one cog in a complex machine that spread horror throughout europe , and which is slowly fading to the recesses of german public consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 89-year-old is alleged to have worked in a nazi concentration camp wagner said the current generation of young germans were less emotional about world war ii than their parents and felt the country needed to move on from its troubled history .
" there 's a widely held view we should draw a line under this chapter of the past , " wagner told news agency reuters .
trial questioned demjanjuk 's lawyers are arguing that he is too ill to stand trial and that his medical condition would worsen in incarceration .
this has led many in germany to question the purpose his trial would serve , klaus-peter schoeppner , head of pollsters emnid , told reuters .
" the share of germans who , in the third generation , want to draw a line under the past and not deal with the guilt question all the time has increased massively over past years , " schoeppner said .
however , this has not swayed german authorities , who feel that if demjanjuk is judged fit to stand trial then he should be made to do so .
" this is not about revenge but about clearing things up and justice , " a spokesman for the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats said .

both teams sewed up uefa cup quarter-final wins , setting up an all-german semi-final tie .
the two sides will meet in the german cup semi-final , as well as once more in the league .
bremen carried a 3-1 first-leg lead into their match in udine , and were put on their heels in the 15th minute when turkish international gokhan inler put the home side ahead 1-0 .
bremen 's talismanic brazilian number ten diego evened the scoreline in the 28th minute , but fabio quagliarella added two more for the italians before half-time , meaning the tie was on a knife 's edge at the break .
quagliarella nearly made it three in the early stages of the second half , turning a shot just wide of the post .
diego , though , turned the match in the 60th minute when he headed in a rebound off the post from a hugo almeida shot .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored another for bremen in the 73rd minute , putting the match on ice – and bremen through .
tested in manchester bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dennis aogo and hamburg are still standing like bremen , hamburg went into its away leg at the city of manchester stadium with a 3-1 lead .
and they too were made to work before booking their passage for the semi-finals .
it was a dream start for hamburg as paulo guerrero fired his team in front in the 12th minute .
but the peruvian 's strike was cancelled out just five minutes later as city 's brazil midfielder elano scored from the penalty spot .
italian referee nicola rizzoli had adjudged , rather questionably to many viewers , that piotr trochowski had handled an elano cross .
from then on city went on the attack , and they very nearly took the lead through a elano free kick in the 42nd minute that hit the crossbar .
five minutes into the second half , city were up 2-1 as beefy ecuadorian striker felipe caicedo beat hamburg keeper frank rost from close range .
hamburg fans then spent 40 very long minutes watching their team do little but defend their slim aggregate lead .
in one of their few forward forays , however , hamburg caught a big break .
with 15 minutes to go , city captain richard dunne committed a rash late challenge on hamburg 's dennis aogo .
he had been booked early on , and thus was sent off .
from then on it was a more equal affair , but neither team scored . renewing acquaintances hamburg and bremen 's wins mean the two sides will square off four more times in the next three and a half weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll be getting to know each other even better this coming wednesday , hamburg hosts bremen in the semifinal of the german cup , the dfb pokal .
the two teams then play home and away to each other on the 30th of april and the 7th of may .
and just three days later , on may 10th , they play again , this time in bremen .
the other half in the other two uefa cup quarterfinals , ukrainian sides polished off french opponents .
niether dynamo kyiv nor paris saint-germain had scored in their encounter last week in paris , and thus both had all to play for in the ukrainian capital .
but only one team showed up – dynamo , who were 2-0 up after just over a quarter of an hour and cruised to a 3-0 win .
meanwhile in marseille , shakhtar donetsk took down olympique 2-1 , winning the tie 4-1 on aggregate . mrh / nt , uefa / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 dw-tv europe live global 3000 - the globalization program we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

both teams sewed up uefa cup quarter-final wins , setting up an all-german semi-final tie .
the two sides will meet in the german cup semi-final , as well as once more in the league .
bremen carried a 3-1 first-leg lead into their match in udine , and were put on their heels in the 15th minute when turkish international gokhan inler put the home side ahead 1-0 .
bremen 's talismanic brazilian number ten diego evened the scoreline in the 28th minute , but fabio quagliarella added two more for the italians before half-time , meaning the tie was on a knife 's edge at the break .
quagliarella nearly made it three in the early stages of the second half , turning a shot just wide of the post .
diego , though , turned the match in the 60th minute when he headed in a rebound off the post from a hugo almeida shot .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored another for bremen in the 73rd minute , putting the match on ice – and bremen through .

five minutes into the second half , city were up 2-1 as beefy ecuadorian striker felipe caicedo beat hamburg keeper frank rost from close range .
hamburg fans then spent 40 very long minutes watching their team do little but defend their slim aggregate lead .
in one of their few forward forays , however , hamburg caught a big break .
with 15 minutes to go , city captain richard dunne committed a rash late challenge on hamburg 's dennis aogo .
he had been booked early on , and thus was sent off .
from then on it was a more equal affair , but neither team scored . renewing acquaintances hamburg and bremen 's wins mean the two sides will square off four more times in the next three and a half weeks .

both teams sewed up uefa cup quarter-final wins , setting up an all-german semi-final tie .
the two sides will meet in the german cup semi-final , as well as once more in the league .
bremen carried a 3-1 first-leg lead into their match in udine , and were put on their heels in the 15th minute when turkish international gokhan inler put the home side ahead 1-0 .
bremen 's talismanic brazilian number ten diego evened the scoreline in the 28th minute , but fabio quagliarella added two more for the italians before half-time , meaning the tie was on a knife 's edge at the break .
quagliarella nearly made it three in the early stages of the second half , turning a shot just wide of the post .
diego , though , turned the match in the 60th minute when he headed in a rebound off the post from a hugo almeida shot .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored another for bremen in the 73rd minute , putting the match on ice – and bremen through .
tested in manchester bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dennis aogo and hamburg are still standing like bremen , hamburg went into its away leg at the city of manchester stadium with a 3-1 lead .
and they too were made to work before booking their passage for the semi-finals .
it was a dream start for hamburg as paulo guerrero fired his team in front in the 12th minute .
but the peruvian 's strike was cancelled out just five minutes later as city 's brazil midfielder elano scored from the penalty spot .
italian referee nicola rizzoli had adjudged , rather questionably to many viewers , that piotr trochowski had handled an elano cross .
from then on city went on the attack , and they very nearly took the lead through a elano free kick in the 42nd minute that hit the crossbar .
five minutes into the second half , city were up 2-1 as beefy ecuadorian striker felipe caicedo beat hamburg keeper frank rost from close range .
hamburg fans then spent 40 very long minutes watching their team do little but defend their slim aggregate lead .
in one of their few forward forays , however , hamburg caught a big break .
with 15 minutes to go , city captain richard dunne committed a rash late challenge on hamburg 's dennis aogo .
he had been booked early on , and thus was sent off .
from then on it was a more equal affair , but neither team scored . renewing acquaintances hamburg and bremen 's wins mean the two sides will square off four more times in the next three and a half weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll be getting to know each other even better this coming wednesday , hamburg hosts bremen in the semifinal of the german cup , the dfb pokal .
the two teams then play home and away to each other on the 30th of april and the 7th of may .
and just three days later , on may 10th , they play again , this time in bremen .
the other half in the other two uefa cup quarterfinals , ukrainian sides polished off french opponents .
niether dynamo kyiv nor paris saint-germain had scored in their encounter last week in paris , and thus both had all to play for in the ukrainian capital .
but only one team showed up – dynamo , who were 2-0 up after just over a quarter of an hour and cruised to a 3-0 win .
meanwhile in marseille , shakhtar donetsk took down olympique 2-1 , winning the tie 4-1 on aggregate . mrh / nt , uefa / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's two remaining international sides have excellent chances in thursday 's uefa cup matches , having both won their first-leg games .
but if they progress , they 'll meet each other . if the two teams both do advance to the semifinals , it will mean germany is guaranteed a spot in the uefa cup final in istanbul on may 20 .
and such a match-up would be all the more of a treat since the two northern german sides are also local rivals with no love lost .
but for that scenario to come to pass , both teams need to close the deal on the road - hamburg against english premier side manchester city , and bremen versus italian serie a competitors udinese .
bremen should be fairly confident , as their italian opponents are languishing in 12th place in their domestic league .
but werder are only tenth in the bundesliga , and their talented brazilian playmaker diego is touch-and-go ahead of the clash in italy .
what 's more , coach thomas schaaf will have to hope that his inconsistent defense has one of its better evenings .

still , the northern germans have been difficult to score against in all competitions this season so there 's no reason why they should n't prevail in manchester .
and even if bremen or hamburg or both should falter on thursday evening , they 'll still be seeing a bit of one another in the coming weeks .
the two rivals meet for a league match next week and clash again in the semifinals of the german cup on may 10 .

germany 's two remaining international sides have excellent chances in thursday 's uefa cup matches , having both won their first-leg games .
but if they progress , they 'll meet each other . if the two teams both do advance to the semifinals , it will mean germany is guaranteed a spot in the uefa cup final in istanbul on may 20 .
and such a match-up would be all the more of a treat since the two northern german sides are also local rivals with no love lost .
but for that scenario to come to pass , both teams need to close the deal on the road - hamburg against english premier side manchester city , and bremen versus italian serie a competitors udinese .
bremen should be fairly confident , as their italian opponents are languishing in 12th place in their domestic league .
but werder are only tenth in the bundesliga , and their talented brazilian playmaker diego is touch-and-go ahead of the clash in italy .
what 's more , coach thomas schaaf will have to hope that his inconsistent defense has one of its better evenings .

coach martin jol has no serious injury worries , although hamburg should be aware that city do have a very good home record .
still , the northern germans have been difficult to score against in all competitions this season so there 's no reason why they should n't prevail in manchester .
and even if bremen or hamburg or both should falter on thursday evening , they 'll still be seeing a bit of one another in the coming weeks .
the two rivals meet for a league match next week and clash again in the semifinals of the german cup on may 10 .

they also filed an appeal seeking to overturn a 2005 patent application -lrb- patent ep 1651777 -rrb- filed by us biotech giant monsanto , and now owned by newsham choice genetics .
the patent aims to protect a pig breeding process based on genetic analysis .
but critics warn that the patent could be extended to cover the animals ' genes themselves , and farmers fear that they could one day be forced to pay royalties for their traditional livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european patent office is under to pressure to ban animal breeding patents the german states of bavaria and hesse also oppose the patent application and have already signaled their intention to introduce a general ban on all patents covering animals and plants .
the head of the german farming association , gerd sonnleitner , told the passauer neue presse newspaper that the patent was a " threat to free breeding . "
" patents on animals and plants should be generally banned , because it contradicts every basic understanding of farming , that individuals should have monopoly rights on genetic material , " sonnleitner said .
" corporations are always trying to bypass the regulations to achieve access to animals and plants .
for this reason all legal loopholes should be closed at the eu level so large companies do not dictate what is bred and what lands up on consumers ' plates , " he added .

but they also asked the government for a new pause to allow civilians to leave the area . in a joint statement on wednesday , british foreign secretary david miliband and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , welcomed the sri lankan government 's original announcement on april 12 of a two-day pause in its military offensive in order to protect civilians , but they said they were concerned that the tamil tiger rebels had not allowed civilians to leave the conflict area .
the sri lankan military has announced that it is now free to begin a final assault to end the 25-year war against the rebels . it says only 1,000 rebels remain , and it accuses the fighters of holding around 100,000 civilians as human shields .
the british and french foreign ministers called on the government to announce a new pause , saying that " democratic governments are rightly held to higher standards for civilian protection than terrorist organizations .

"
that 's when a designer in germany discovered a booming market for modern , urban clothes and accessories with a muslim message . people from many different cultures are likely to agree : slippers are rather uncool .
but in styleislam 's fashion design office , everyone walks around in them .
here , in the small german town of witten in the middle of the industrial ruhr region , chic clothes and accessories are designed for fashion-conscious but devout young muslims . styleislam was the brainchild of melih kesmen , a stocky man with a ponytail and goatee . " here are a few examples of our designs , like one about the hijab - the headscarf , " he said , pulling a black handbag out of a cupboard in the company 's small stockroom . " hijab , my right , my choice , my life , " is written on the bag in big white letters . " if a woman wants to wear a headscarf , then she should be allowed to , " said kesmen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if women want to wear headscarves , they should , says kesmen the motto on the bag could provoke hours of discussion , and so could plenty of other motifs on the entrepreneur 's shelves , such as baby bibs printed with the word " minimuslim " or a call to prayer : " salah , always get connected . " a different kind of response the project began three years ago , as the scandal raged over caricatures of the prophet muhammad printed in a danish newspaper .
at the time , kesmen was living in london with his wife yeliz . " the publication of the drawings bothered me , but i was also really annoyed by the reaction from our side , the muslim side , " said kesmen .
in many muslim countries around the world , violent demonstrations were held and danish flags were burned . " so i thought , there must be a way to respond creatively and productively , in a peaceful way , " added kesmen .
and he found one : he had a t-shirt printed with the slogan " i love my prophet . " so many people literally wanted to buy the shirt off of his back that kesmen , who is trained as a graphic designer , recognized the untapped market for trendy clothes with a muslim message . welcome to the ummah after moving back to his hometown , witten , he took action and the young company 's product line and profit have been growing ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muhammad cartoons , which were republished in 2008 , caused a stir in the muslim world " the label pays for itself now , " said kesmen , who advertizes that one euro per shirt sold is donated to an orphanage in africa . kesmen does n't just encourage religious faithfulness among his customers , but also in the workplace .
when hiring women , he prefers those who wear a headscarf .
and regular prayer breaks are taken in the office - which is why everyone wears slippers instead of shoes . germany 's most well-known muslim rapper , ammar 114 , advertizes for styleislam , which has boosted the labels popularity among young believers . one of them is salman sagir of berlin , whose parents are from pakistan .
his shirt , with the slogan " ummah - be part of it , " was tight across his muscular shoulders .
he did n't seem bothered that curious passersby examined his chest bearing the invitation to join the ummah , the muslim community . " hopefully styleislam will come out with more sizes soon , " said sagir . t-shirts to get people talking though many of styleislam 's slogans are designed to show positive sides to islam , they are n't necessarily accessible to non-muslims , as some of the phrases include islamic concepts or are written in turkish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : styleislam 's slogans are meant to spark conversation " if someone does n't understand , maybe it 'll make them curious and it will spark a conversation about the phrase , " said kesmen .
the company also has an explanation for each slogan on its website , styleislam.com. sometimes explanations are necessary - styleislam 's slogans can be ironic , cheeky or even downright provocative . kesmen got threatening phone calls over the slogan " jesus was a muslim . "
he defends it , saying : " jesus was one of the greatest prophets in islam and his message was n't actually any different than the prophet muhammad 's . " while opinions may differ on the matter , kesmen 's aim is to give young muslims a way to combine fashion with their faith and be confident about who they are .

he says germany must have known of the unsatisfactory prison conditions in kenya . ali mohamed a.d. was captured by the german navy patrolling the gulf of aden last month when he allegedly tried to seize a freighter , the mv courier .
he was transferred to kenya along with eight other somali suspects for prosecution in the port city of mombasa under an eu agreement with kenya .
his lawyer , oliver wallasch , said his client , who denies involvement in piracy , was seeking 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,300 -rrb- from the german government before the berlin regional court for damages incurred after his " unlawful " transfer to kenya .
the lawsuit contends that the interior , defense , justice and foreign ministries must have been aware that a suspect would likely have no access to medical treatment , sanitary facilities or privacy in a kenyan jail .
according to wallasch 's application to the court , as quoted by the website of german newspaper bild , " the plaintiff finds himself in a cell designed for four men .
however , he shares the cell with nine others . "
it said there was no privacy , and no account was taken of muslim dietary restrictions .
" vegetarian food is only available for medical reasons , so that the plaintiff is forced to eat pork if he is not to starve . "
the german foreign ministry denied that germany took no account of the human rights of alleged pirates . a spokesman said the government checked that standards were maintained .
meanwhile a second suspect , mohamud mohamed h. , has filed an injunction with the berlin administrative court aiming to force the german foreign ministry to cover the costs of a public defender in kenya .
his lawyer , andreas schulz , said his trial was to begin in mombasa on april 22 and he currently has no defense attorney there .
wallasch said another three suspected pirates had hired german lawyers .
kenya and the eu have signed an agreement under which suspected somali pirates who are detained in the course of the eu anti-piracy naval mission off the somali coast are transferred to kenya . a german ship , the hansa stavanger , is currently one of at least 18 ships held by somali pirates .

he says germany must have known of the unsatisfactory prison conditions in kenya . ali mohamed a.d. was captured by the german navy patrolling the gulf of aden last month when he allegedly tried to seize a freighter , the mv courier .
he was transferred to kenya along with eight other somali suspects for prosecution in the port city of mombasa under an eu agreement with kenya .
his lawyer , oliver wallasch , said his client , who denies involvement in piracy , was seeking 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,300 -rrb- from the german government before the berlin regional court for damages incurred after his " unlawful " transfer to kenya .
the lawsuit contends that the interior , defense , justice and foreign ministries must have been aware that a suspect would likely have no access to medical treatment , sanitary facilities or privacy in a kenyan jail .
according to wallasch 's application to the court , as quoted by the website of german newspaper bild , " the plaintiff finds himself in a cell designed for four men .
however , he shares the cell with nine others . "
it said there was no privacy , and no account was taken of muslim dietary restrictions .
" vegetarian food is only available for medical reasons , so that the plaintiff is forced to eat pork if he is not to starve . "
the german foreign ministry denied that germany took no account of the human rights of alleged pirates . a spokesman said the government checked that standards were maintained .
meanwhile a second suspect , mohamud mohamed h. , has filed an injunction with the berlin administrative court aiming to force the german foreign ministry to cover the costs of a public defender in kenya .
his lawyer , andreas schulz , said his trial was to begin in mombasa on april 22 and he currently has no defense attorney there .
wallasch said another three suspected pirates had hired german lawyers .
kenya and the eu have signed an agreement under which suspected somali pirates who are detained in the course of the eu anti-piracy naval mission off the somali coast are transferred to kenya . a german ship , the hansa stavanger , is currently one of at least 18 ships held by somali pirates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.04.2009 international community mulls response to somalia 's piracy problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on the us maersk alabama brought the issue to a head with the escalation of piracy off the coast of somalia , the international community is pondering what action to take .
but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .
" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.04.2009 international community mulls response to somalia 's piracy problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on the us maersk alabama brought the issue to a head with the escalation of piracy off the coast of somalia , the international community is pondering what action to take .
but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .
" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .
" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .

that could mean the withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops from the republic which has suffered two separatist wars in the past 15 years . the cancellation was ordered by russian president dmitry medvedev and took effect thursday morning , according to a statement from the national anti-terrorist committee .
a spokesman for the committee , which has responsibility for the region , said the decision is aimed at further normalizing the situation there , and restoring and developing its economic and social infrastructure .
restrictions such as curfews , roadblocks , spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in chechnya in 1999 when russia sent troops to the region to end the north caucasus republic 's short-lived independence , which it won in an earlier war with moscow . critics say the special regime , which also includes restricted access for journalists , has fostered huge violations of human rights .
over the past 10 years the pro-moscow regional administration led by former rebel ramzan kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance . kadyrov says chechnya today is stable and has put behind it the violence which claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994 .
kadyrov has long wanted to ease both the restrictions and slacken moscow 's grip on the region .
russia has already withdrawn most of its army units from chechnya but tens of thousands of police from other russian regions and scores of special service units still patrol there .
interior ministry spokesman col. vasily panchenkov said last month that ending the regime could lead to the withdrawal of about 20,000 ministry troops from chechnya .

that could mean the withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops from the republic which has suffered two separatist wars in the past 15 years . the cancellation was ordered by russian president dmitry medvedev and took effect thursday morning , according to a statement from the national anti-terrorist committee .
a spokesman for the committee , which has responsibility for the region , said the decision is aimed at further normalizing the situation there , and restoring and developing its economic and social infrastructure .
restrictions such as curfews , roadblocks , spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in chechnya in 1999 when russia sent troops to the region to end the north caucasus republic 's short-lived independence , which it won in an earlier war with moscow . critics say the special regime , which also includes restricted access for journalists , has fostered huge violations of human rights .
over the past 10 years the pro-moscow regional administration led by former rebel ramzan kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance . kadyrov says chechnya today is stable and has put behind it the violence which claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994 .
kadyrov has long wanted to ease both the restrictions and slacken moscow 's grip on the region .
russia has already withdrawn most of its army units from chechnya but tens of thousands of police from other russian regions and scores of special service units still patrol there .
interior ministry spokesman col. vasily panchenkov said last month that ending the regime could lead to the withdrawal of about 20,000 ministry troops from chechnya .
but panchenkov said at least one interior ministry brigade and a division of military troops would remain in the republic . mll / ncy , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.04.2009 german designer makes edgy urban fashion for young muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion label founder melih kesmen was looking for a way to express his faith it all started with a t-shirt bearing the slogan " i love my prophet . "
that 's when a designer in germany discovered a booming market for modern , urban clothes and accessories with a muslim message . people from many different cultures are likely to agree : slippers are rather uncool .
but in styleislam 's fashion design office , everyone walks around in them .
here , in the small german town of witten in the middle of the industrial ruhr region , chic clothes and accessories are designed for fashion-conscious but devout young muslims . styleislam was the brainchild of melih kesmen , a stocky man with a ponytail and goatee . " here are a few examples of our designs , like one about the hijab - the headscarf , " he said , pulling a black handbag out of a cupboard in the company 's small stockroom . " hijab , my right , my choice , my life , " is written on the bag in big white letters . " if a woman wants to wear a headscarf , then she should be allowed to , " said kesmen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if women want to wear headscarves , they should , says kesmen the motto on the bag could provoke hours of discussion , and so could plenty of other motifs on the entrepreneur 's shelves , such as baby bibs printed with the word " minimuslim " or a call to prayer : " salah , always get connected . " a different kind of response the project began three years ago , as the scandal raged over caricatures of the prophet muhammad printed in a danish newspaper .
at the time , kesmen was living in london with his wife yeliz . " the publication of the drawings bothered me , but i was also really annoyed by the reaction from our side , the muslim side , " said kesmen .
in many muslim countries around the world , violent demonstrations were held and danish flags were burned . " so i thought , there must be a way to respond creatively and productively , in a peaceful way , " added kesmen .
and he found one : he had a t-shirt printed with the slogan " i love my prophet . " so many people literally wanted to buy the shirt off of his back that kesmen , who is trained as a graphic designer , recognized the untapped market for trendy clothes with a muslim message . welcome to the ummah after moving back to his hometown , witten , he took action and the young company 's product line and profit have been growing ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muhammad cartoons , which were republished in 2008 , caused a stir in the muslim world " the label pays for itself now , " said kesmen , who advertizes that one euro per shirt sold is donated to an orphanage in africa . kesmen does n't just encourage religious faithfulness among his customers , but also in the workplace .
when hiring women , he prefers those who wear a headscarf .
and regular prayer breaks are taken in the office - which is why everyone wears slippers instead of shoes . germany 's most well-known muslim rapper , ammar 114 , advertizes for styleislam , which has boosted the labels popularity among young believers . one of them is salman sagir of berlin , whose parents are from pakistan .

"
that 's when a designer in germany discovered a booming market for modern , urban clothes and accessories with a muslim message . people from many different cultures are likely to agree : slippers are rather uncool .
but in styleislam 's fashion design office , everyone walks around in them .
here , in the small german town of witten in the middle of the industrial ruhr region , chic clothes and accessories are designed for fashion-conscious but devout young muslims . styleislam was the brainchild of melih kesmen , a stocky man with a ponytail and goatee . " here are a few examples of our designs , like one about the hijab - the headscarf , " he said , pulling a black handbag out of a cupboard in the company 's small stockroom . " hijab , my right , my choice , my life , " is written on the bag in big white letters . " if a woman wants to wear a headscarf , then she should be allowed to , " said kesmen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if women want to wear headscarves , they should , says kesmen the motto on the bag could provoke hours of discussion , and so could plenty of other motifs on the entrepreneur 's shelves , such as baby bibs printed with the word " minimuslim " or a call to prayer : " salah , always get connected . " a different kind of response the project began three years ago , as the scandal raged over caricatures of the prophet muhammad printed in a danish newspaper .
at the time , kesmen was living in london with his wife yeliz . " the publication of the drawings bothered me , but i was also really annoyed by the reaction from our side , the muslim side , " said kesmen .
in many muslim countries around the world , violent demonstrations were held and danish flags were burned . " so i thought , there must be a way to respond creatively and productively , in a peaceful way , " added kesmen .
and he found one : he had a t-shirt printed with the slogan " i love my prophet . " so many people literally wanted to buy the shirt off of his back that kesmen , who is trained as a graphic designer , recognized the untapped market for trendy clothes with a muslim message . welcome to the ummah after moving back to his hometown , witten , he took action and the young company 's product line and profit have been growing ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muhammad cartoons , which were republished in 2008 , caused a stir in the muslim world " the label pays for itself now , " said kesmen , who advertizes that one euro per shirt sold is donated to an orphanage in africa . kesmen does n't just encourage religious faithfulness among his customers , but also in the workplace .

the report also said that couples would be entitled to a 600-euro bonus and that all 30 million german taxpayers would be eligible for the payment .
around three billion euros - to be taken from a new stock exchange tax - would be made available for the bonus scheme .
an spd spokesman described the reports on thursday as speculation and said that no firm decisions had been taken on the matter .

fdp general-secretary dirk niebel labeled the scheme as typically socialist , while his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said it would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the chairman of the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would only complicate people 's taxes , labeling it " the worst form of rip off . "
the green party 's leading candidate for the bundestag elections , juergen trittin , criticized the plan for being what he described as an expensive gift .

the report also said that couples would be entitled to a 600-euro bonus and that all 30 million german taxpayers would be eligible for the payment .
around three billion euros - to be taken from a new stock exchange tax - would be made available for the bonus scheme .
an spd spokesman described the reports on thursday as speculation and said that no firm decisions had been taken on the matter .
plan hosed down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen trittin has labeled the plan an expensive gift but the plan has already been talked down by opposition politicians keen to snuff out early spd campaigning for the upcoming federal election .
fdp general-secretary dirk niebel labeled the scheme as typically socialist , while his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said it would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the chairman of the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would only complicate people 's taxes , labeling it " the worst form of rip off . "
the green party 's leading candidate for the bundestag elections , juergen trittin , criticized the plan for being what he described as an expensive gift .

while team obama is officially on a mission to create a new dialogue between the northern and southern parts of the american continent , one issue in particular is likely to dominate proceedings : cuba .
when it comes to us relations with latin america , cuba is always the elephant in the room .
despite not actually being in the room – cuba has not been invited to friday 's gathering – ending the long-standing enmity between washington and havana and the 47-year-old us economic embargo is expected to be the issue on everyone 's lips .
this is true before the summit has even started .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , who has developed close personal ties with cuba 's ruling castro brothers and has long sought to limit us influence in latin america , made it clear he would push cuba 's case at the summit .
" why is cuba not at the summit of the americas ? " he asked on monday .
" this is one of the main questions that from now on will resonate in trinidad . "
chavez said he would " demand that the empire -lrb- the united states -rrb- run by obama lift the blockade on cuba . "
ecuadorian president rafael correa also indicated that he would use part of his five-minute speech at the summit to blast the embargo .
cuba , he said , " can not continue to be excluded from the inter-american system – that 's barbaric . "
white house officials expect a certain amount of dialogue on cuba but they hope that more time at the summit will be devoted to their own aim of setting a new tone for relations between the united states and latin america .
washington would much rather concentrate on economic reforms , renewable energy , public safety and the fight against drug trafficking – not to mention measures to tackle the global economic crisis .
but if obama and his team arrive hoping that the summit is not distracted by the cuban issue , they are likely to have those hopes dashed .
traditional enmity over us power and influence while it remains to be seen whether this summit will produce the kind of clashes provoked during george w. bush 's tenure , many observers believe that obama is about to find out just how far his enormous goodwill and popularity in most of latin america will stretch – and cuba may just be the snapping point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castros have the support of the majority of latin america " the cuba issue is very important to latin american societies , " tom carothers , the vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , told deutsche welle .
" it 's a symbolic issue , which represents the continuation of the traditional image of the us standing on the neck of some latin american governments .
so it sets a tone that inhibits the united states ' position in the region . "
the cuba issue was high on the agenda when latin american and caribbean nations met at a summit in brazil in december where they agreed the ongoing embargo against cuba was unjust and unnecessary , and should go .
this is a regional attitude that has not been lost on the new president .
obama attempted to defuse tensions on cuba and moved to calm the region in general by announcing earlier this week that he was lifting curbs on travel and money transfers by cuban-americans to the communist-ruled island .
" i think the obama administration correctly perceived that by making an announcement a week before the summit that they 're really starting a process of positive change in us relations with cuba , " carothers said .
" the americans hope to send a signal to governments and people in latin america that they would like to reposition the us much more generally in the region .
us will only go so far without cuban incentives , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing travel to cuba is a first step in the new us policy " i think the us is ready to go quite far if it gets some positive response from cuba , " carothers added .

but the region is now curious , turning its attention to the cuban government and saying ' now you have a positive signal from the united states , what 's your reaction ? '
so this is a change after 50 years of the region waiting for the united states to make a move . "
but while the new administration may have extended a hand , experts believe a full embrace is still some distance away .
washington remains unmoved on the issue of the embargo as long as cuba remains undemocratic and imprisons political dissidents .
on thursday , obama called on havana to send a signal that there will be " changes in how cuba operates " to prompt a thaw in relations , ahead of the summit .
he called for political prisoners to be released and free speech to be allowed in order to " see a further thawing of relations " between the us and its long-time communist foe .
" if the obama administration feels that it can get some positive reaction back from the cuban government , they could engage in a direct discussion , which might allow further steps , " carothers said .
" however , i think the administration is unlikely to take a further unilateral step to ease sanctions without getting at least something back from the other side . "

" this summit has a lot of economic and social issues to deal with , " tom carothers said .
" there is the global financial crisis which is both a common issue and also an issue of division , as the latin americans blame the us ; then there is the on-going desire to improve and deepen free trade in the region as well as the hope for more us involvement in the war on drugs and some us movement on immigration reform .
" but we should see this summit in a broader context , " he added .
" we have a new american president trying to change the tone of relations and also change the impression in latin america that the united states has been neglecting the region for the last eight years . "

while team obama is officially on a mission to create a new dialogue between the northern and southern parts of the american continent , one issue in particular is likely to dominate proceedings : cuba .
when it comes to us relations with latin america , cuba is always the elephant in the room .
despite not actually being in the room – cuba has not been invited to friday 's gathering – ending the long-standing enmity between washington and havana and the 47-year-old us economic embargo is expected to be the issue on everyone 's lips .
this is true before the summit has even started .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , who has developed close personal ties with cuba 's ruling castro brothers and has long sought to limit us influence in latin america , made it clear he would push cuba 's case at the summit .
" why is cuba not at the summit of the americas ? " he asked on monday .
" this is one of the main questions that from now on will resonate in trinidad . "
chavez said he would " demand that the empire -lrb- the united states -rrb- run by obama lift the blockade on cuba . "
ecuadorian president rafael correa also indicated that he would use part of his five-minute speech at the summit to blast the embargo .
cuba , he said , " can not continue to be excluded from the inter-american system – that 's barbaric . "
white house officials expect a certain amount of dialogue on cuba but they hope that more time at the summit will be devoted to their own aim of setting a new tone for relations between the united states and latin america .
washington would much rather concentrate on economic reforms , renewable energy , public safety and the fight against drug trafficking – not to mention measures to tackle the global economic crisis .
but if obama and his team arrive hoping that the summit is not distracted by the cuban issue , they are likely to have those hopes dashed .
traditional enmity over us power and influence while it remains to be seen whether this summit will produce the kind of clashes provoked during george w. bush 's tenure , many observers believe that obama is about to find out just how far his enormous goodwill and popularity in most of latin america will stretch – and cuba may just be the snapping point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castros have the support of the majority of latin america " the cuba issue is very important to latin american societies , " tom carothers , the vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , told deutsche welle .
" it 's a symbolic issue , which represents the continuation of the traditional image of the us standing on the neck of some latin american governments .
so it sets a tone that inhibits the united states ' position in the region . "
the cuba issue was high on the agenda when latin american and caribbean nations met at a summit in brazil in december where they agreed the ongoing embargo against cuba was unjust and unnecessary , and should go .
this is a regional attitude that has not been lost on the new president .
obama attempted to defuse tensions on cuba and moved to calm the region in general by announcing earlier this week that he was lifting curbs on travel and money transfers by cuban-americans to the communist-ruled island .
" i think the obama administration correctly perceived that by making an announcement a week before the summit that they 're really starting a process of positive change in us relations with cuba , " carothers said .
" the americans hope to send a signal to governments and people in latin america that they would like to reposition the us much more generally in the region .
us will only go so far without cuban incentives , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing travel to cuba is a first step in the new us policy " i think the us is ready to go quite far if it gets some positive response from cuba , " carothers added .
" already they have , to some extent , put the ball in the court of the castros , although the cuban government might not feel that way yet .
but the region is now curious , turning its attention to the cuban government and saying ' now you have a positive signal from the united states , what 's your reaction ? '
so this is a change after 50 years of the region waiting for the united states to make a move . "
but while the new administration may have extended a hand , experts believe a full embrace is still some distance away .
washington remains unmoved on the issue of the embargo as long as cuba remains undemocratic and imprisons political dissidents .
on thursday , obama called on havana to send a signal that there will be " changes in how cuba operates " to prompt a thaw in relations , ahead of the summit .
he called for political prisoners to be released and free speech to be allowed in order to " see a further thawing of relations " between the us and its long-time communist foe .
" if the obama administration feels that it can get some positive reaction back from the cuban government , they could engage in a direct discussion , which might allow further steps , " carothers said .
" however , i think the administration is unlikely to take a further unilateral step to ease sanctions without getting at least something back from the other side . "
obama hoping to reverse eight years of perceived neglect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has already reached out to leaders like brazil 's lula whether obama 's step-by-step policy towards cuba will be enough to satisfy his critics in latin america remains to be seen .
the us president may have to offer concrete assurances on a number of other pressing issues if he is to convince his neighbors he 's offering ' change they can believe in . '
" this summit has a lot of economic and social issues to deal with , " tom carothers said .
" there is the global financial crisis which is both a common issue and also an issue of division , as the latin americans blame the us ; then there is the on-going desire to improve and deepen free trade in the region as well as the hope for more us involvement in the war on drugs and some us movement on immigration reform .
" but we should see this summit in a broader context , " he added .
" we have a new american president trying to change the tone of relations and also change the impression in latin america that the united states has been neglecting the region for the last eight years . "

he said the situation would change only if producers received low-interest grants from the german government or advance payments from the european union .
in addition , sonnleitner demanded that supermarkets stop gagging milk producers and assume greater social responsibility .
" german consumers are shopping more economically , " sonnleitner said .
in addition , agriculture exports have decreased dramatically .
his calls are being echoed by bavarian agriculture minister helmut brunner , who has said that chancellor angela merkel needs to give the issue " top priority . "
" with the price of butter lower than it was after the war , surely consumers must also realize that something is not right , " brunner said .

the report also said that couples would be entitled to a 600-euro bonus and that all 30 million german taxpayers would be eligible for the payment .
around three billion euros - to be taken from a new stock exchange tax - would be made available for the bonus scheme .
an spd spokesman described the reports on thursday as speculation and said that no firm decisions had been taken on the matter .
plan hosed down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen trittin has labeled the plan an expensive gift but the plan has already been talked down by opposition politicians keen to snuff out early spd campaigning for the upcoming federal election .
fdp general-secretary dirk niebel labeled the scheme as typically socialist , while his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said it would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the chairman of the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would only complicate people 's taxes , labeling it " the worst form of rip off . "
the green party 's leading candidate for the bundestag elections , juergen trittin , criticized the plan for being what he described as an expensive gift .
" the money would be more sensibly used to reduce social security contributions , " he said .

the report also said that couples would be entitled to a 600-euro bonus and that all 30 million german taxpayers would be eligible for the payment .
around three billion euros - to be taken from a new stock exchange tax - would be made available for the bonus scheme .
an spd spokesman described the reports on thursday as speculation and said that no firm decisions had been taken on the matter .
plan hosed down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen trittin has labeled the plan an expensive gift but the plan has already been talked down by opposition politicians keen to snuff out early spd campaigning for the upcoming federal election .
fdp general-secretary dirk niebel labeled the scheme as typically socialist , while his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said it would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the chairman of the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would only complicate people 's taxes , labeling it " the worst form of rip off . "
the green party 's leading candidate for the bundestag elections , juergen trittin , criticized the plan for being what he described as an expensive gift .
" the money would be more sensibly used to reduce social security contributions , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 16.04.2009 latin americans to challenge obama on his new cuban policy shift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has extended a hand to cuba but latin america wants more us president barack obama heads to the summit of the americas friday expecting to face calls from his latin american counterparts to relax the economic embargo on cuba and improve relations . barely a week after his first , frenetic overseas trip , us president barack obama is to fly into trinidad and tobago for the 34-leader summit of the americas on friday .
while team obama is officially on a mission to create a new dialogue between the northern and southern parts of the american continent , one issue in particular is likely to dominate proceedings : cuba .
when it comes to us relations with latin america , cuba is always the elephant in the room .
despite not actually being in the room – cuba has not been invited to friday 's gathering – ending the long-standing enmity between washington and havana and the 47-year-old us economic embargo is expected to be the issue on everyone 's lips .
this is true before the summit has even started .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , who has developed close personal ties with cuba 's ruling castro brothers and has long sought to limit us influence in latin america , made it clear he would push cuba 's case at the summit .
" why is cuba not at the summit of the americas ? " he asked on monday .
" this is one of the main questions that from now on will resonate in trinidad . "
chavez said he would " demand that the empire -lrb- the united states -rrb- run by obama lift the blockade on cuba . "
ecuadorian president rafael correa also indicated that he would use part of his five-minute speech at the summit to blast the embargo .
cuba , he said , " can not continue to be excluded from the inter-american system – that 's barbaric . "
white house officials expect a certain amount of dialogue on cuba but they hope that more time at the summit will be devoted to their own aim of setting a new tone for relations between the united states and latin america .
washington would much rather concentrate on economic reforms , renewable energy , public safety and the fight against drug trafficking – not to mention measures to tackle the global economic crisis .
but if obama and his team arrive hoping that the summit is not distracted by the cuban issue , they are likely to have those hopes dashed .
traditional enmity over us power and influence while it remains to be seen whether this summit will produce the kind of clashes provoked during george w. bush 's tenure , many observers believe that obama is about to find out just how far his enormous goodwill and popularity in most of latin america will stretch – and cuba may just be the snapping point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castros have the support of the majority of latin america " the cuba issue is very important to latin american societies , " tom carothers , the vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , told deutsche welle .
" it 's a symbolic issue , which represents the continuation of the traditional image of the us standing on the neck of some latin american governments .
so it sets a tone that inhibits the united states ' position in the region . "
the cuba issue was high on the agenda when latin american and caribbean nations met at a summit in brazil in december where they agreed the ongoing embargo against cuba was unjust and unnecessary , and should go .
this is a regional attitude that has not been lost on the new president .
obama attempted to defuse tensions on cuba and moved to calm the region in general by announcing earlier this week that he was lifting curbs on travel and money transfers by cuban-americans to the communist-ruled island .
" i think the obama administration correctly perceived that by making an announcement a week before the summit that they 're really starting a process of positive change in us relations with cuba , " carothers said .
" the americans hope to send a signal to governments and people in latin america that they would like to reposition the us much more generally in the region .
us will only go so far without cuban incentives , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing travel to cuba is a first step in the new us policy " i think the us is ready to go quite far if it gets some positive response from cuba , " carothers added .
" already they have , to some extent , put the ball in the court of the castros , although the cuban government might not feel that way yet .
but the region is now curious , turning its attention to the cuban government and saying ' now you have a positive signal from the united states , what 's your reaction ? '
so this is a change after 50 years of the region waiting for the united states to make a move . "
but while the new administration may have extended a hand , experts believe a full embrace is still some distance away .
washington remains unmoved on the issue of the embargo as long as cuba remains undemocratic and imprisons political dissidents .
on thursday , obama called on havana to send a signal that there will be " changes in how cuba operates " to prompt a thaw in relations , ahead of the summit .
he called for political prisoners to be released and free speech to be allowed in order to " see a further thawing of relations " between the us and its long-time communist foe .
" if the obama administration feels that it can get some positive reaction back from the cuban government , they could engage in a direct discussion , which might allow further steps , " carothers said .
" however , i think the administration is unlikely to take a further unilateral step to ease sanctions without getting at least something back from the other side . "
obama hoping to reverse eight years of perceived neglect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has already reached out to leaders like brazil 's lula whether obama 's step-by-step policy towards cuba will be enough to satisfy his critics in latin america remains to be seen .
the us president may have to offer concrete assurances on a number of other pressing issues if he is to convince his neighbors he 's offering ' change they can believe in . '
" this summit has a lot of economic and social issues to deal with , " tom carothers said .
" there is the global financial crisis which is both a common issue and also an issue of division , as the latin americans blame the us ; then there is the on-going desire to improve and deepen free trade in the region as well as the hope for more us involvement in the war on drugs and some us movement on immigration reform .
" but we should see this summit in a broader context , " he added .
" we have a new american president trying to change the tone of relations and also change the impression in latin america that the united states has been neglecting the region for the last eight years . "

while team obama is officially on a mission to create a new dialogue between the northern and southern parts of the american continent , one issue in particular is likely to dominate proceedings : cuba .
when it comes to us relations with latin america , cuba is always the elephant in the room .
despite not actually being in the room – cuba has not been invited to friday 's gathering – ending the long-standing enmity between washington and havana and the 47-year-old us economic embargo is expected to be the issue on everyone 's lips .
this is true before the summit has even started .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , who has developed close personal ties with cuba 's ruling castro brothers and has long sought to limit us influence in latin america , made it clear he would push cuba 's case at the summit .
" why is cuba not at the summit of the americas ? " he asked on monday .
" this is one of the main questions that from now on will resonate in trinidad . "
chavez said he would " demand that the empire -lrb- the united states -rrb- run by obama lift the blockade on cuba . "
ecuadorian president rafael correa also indicated that he would use part of his five-minute speech at the summit to blast the embargo .
cuba , he said , " can not continue to be excluded from the inter-american system – that 's barbaric . "
white house officials expect a certain amount of dialogue on cuba but they hope that more time at the summit will be devoted to their own aim of setting a new tone for relations between the united states and latin america .
washington would much rather concentrate on economic reforms , renewable energy , public safety and the fight against drug trafficking – not to mention measures to tackle the global economic crisis .
but if obama and his team arrive hoping that the summit is not distracted by the cuban issue , they are likely to have those hopes dashed .
traditional enmity over us power and influence while it remains to be seen whether this summit will produce the kind of clashes provoked during george w. bush 's tenure , many observers believe that obama is about to find out just how far his enormous goodwill and popularity in most of latin america will stretch – and cuba may just be the snapping point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castros have the support of the majority of latin america " the cuba issue is very important to latin american societies , " tom carothers , the vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , told deutsche welle .

while team obama is officially on a mission to create a new dialogue between the northern and southern parts of the american continent , one issue in particular is likely to dominate proceedings : cuba .
when it comes to us relations with latin america , cuba is always the elephant in the room .
despite not actually being in the room – cuba has not been invited to friday 's gathering – ending the long-standing enmity between washington and havana and the 47-year-old us economic embargo is expected to be the issue on everyone 's lips .
this is true before the summit has even started .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , who has developed close personal ties with cuba 's ruling castro brothers and has long sought to limit us influence in latin america , made it clear he would push cuba 's case at the summit .
" why is cuba not at the summit of the americas ? " he asked on monday .
" this is one of the main questions that from now on will resonate in trinidad . "
chavez said he would " demand that the empire -lrb- the united states -rrb- run by obama lift the blockade on cuba . "
ecuadorian president rafael correa also indicated that he would use part of his five-minute speech at the summit to blast the embargo .
cuba , he said , " can not continue to be excluded from the inter-american system – that 's barbaric . "
white house officials expect a certain amount of dialogue on cuba but they hope that more time at the summit will be devoted to their own aim of setting a new tone for relations between the united states and latin america .
washington would much rather concentrate on economic reforms , renewable energy , public safety and the fight against drug trafficking – not to mention measures to tackle the global economic crisis .
but if obama and his team arrive hoping that the summit is not distracted by the cuban issue , they are likely to have those hopes dashed .
traditional enmity over us power and influence while it remains to be seen whether this summit will produce the kind of clashes provoked during george w. bush 's tenure , many observers believe that obama is about to find out just how far his enormous goodwill and popularity in most of latin america will stretch – and cuba may just be the snapping point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castros have the support of the majority of latin america " the cuba issue is very important to latin american societies , " tom carothers , the vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , told deutsche welle .
" it 's a symbolic issue , which represents the continuation of the traditional image of the us standing on the neck of some latin american governments .
so it sets a tone that inhibits the united states ' position in the region . "
the cuba issue was high on the agenda when latin american and caribbean nations met at a summit in brazil in december where they agreed the ongoing embargo against cuba was unjust and unnecessary , and should go .
this is a regional attitude that has not been lost on the new president .
obama attempted to defuse tensions on cuba and moved to calm the region in general by announcing earlier this week that he was lifting curbs on travel and money transfers by cuban-americans to the communist-ruled island .
" i think the obama administration correctly perceived that by making an announcement a week before the summit that they 're really starting a process of positive change in us relations with cuba , " carothers said .
" the americans hope to send a signal to governments and people in latin america that they would like to reposition the us much more generally in the region .
us will only go so far without cuban incentives , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing travel to cuba is a first step in the new us policy " i think the us is ready to go quite far if it gets some positive response from cuba , " carothers added .
" already they have , to some extent , put the ball in the court of the castros , although the cuban government might not feel that way yet .
but the region is now curious , turning its attention to the cuban government and saying ' now you have a positive signal from the united states , what 's your reaction ? '
so this is a change after 50 years of the region waiting for the united states to make a move . "
but while the new administration may have extended a hand , experts believe a full embrace is still some distance away .
washington remains unmoved on the issue of the embargo as long as cuba remains undemocratic and imprisons political dissidents .
on thursday , obama called on havana to send a signal that there will be " changes in how cuba operates " to prompt a thaw in relations , ahead of the summit .
he called for political prisoners to be released and free speech to be allowed in order to " see a further thawing of relations " between the us and its long-time communist foe .
" if the obama administration feels that it can get some positive reaction back from the cuban government , they could engage in a direct discussion , which might allow further steps , " carothers said .
" however , i think the administration is unlikely to take a further unilateral step to ease sanctions without getting at least something back from the other side . "
obama hoping to reverse eight years of perceived neglect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has already reached out to leaders like brazil 's lula whether obama 's step-by-step policy towards cuba will be enough to satisfy his critics in latin america remains to be seen .
the us president may have to offer concrete assurances on a number of other pressing issues if he is to convince his neighbors he 's offering ' change they can believe in . '
" this summit has a lot of economic and social issues to deal with , " tom carothers said .
" there is the global financial crisis which is both a common issue and also an issue of division , as the latin americans blame the us ; then there is the on-going desire to improve and deepen free trade in the region as well as the hope for more us involvement in the war on drugs and some us movement on immigration reform .
" but we should see this summit in a broader context , " he added .
" we have a new american president trying to change the tone of relations and also change the impression in latin america that the united states has been neglecting the region for the last eight years . "

the organization went to great lengths to explain that the loss did not arise from exposure to toxic assets .

the cdc receives regulatory deposits from the french government and acts as an investment arm for long-term policy .
the bank said it had set aside 2.082 billion euros for its 17.6-percent holding in franco-belgian financial house dexia and for its 20.1-percent interest in french civil engineering group eiffage .
it also said it had laid out 921 million euros for its portfolio of shares .
the belgian and french governments , as well as cdc , contributed to a 6.4 billion-euro bailout of dexia late last year .

an insider at opel told ard that a " lifeboat " for the ruesselsheim-based company had been found . the board of directors is reported to have focused on patents and the debts that gm has with opel . analysts say that part of a solution to gm 's problems could mean breaking up the automaker into separate " good " and " bad " components .
this would likely lead to the phasing out of ailing branches , such as unsellable brands and factories , and the continuation of successful brands . rainer einenkel , head of opel 's work council , told ard that there are continuing discussions .

opel currently has enough cash to continue operation independently for the next four months , the newspaper bild reported wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.04.2009 international community mulls response to somalia 's piracy problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on the us maersk alabama brought the issue to a head with the escalation of piracy off the coast of somalia , the international community is pondering what action to take .
but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .
" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "

" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

he says germany must have known of the unsatisfactory prison conditions in kenya . ali mohamed a.d. was captured by the german navy patrolling the gulf of aden last month when he allegedly tried to seize a freighter , the mv courier .
he was transferred to kenya along with eight other somali suspects for prosecution in the port city of mombasa under an eu agreement with kenya .
his lawyer , oliver wallasch , said his client , who denies involvement in piracy , was seeking 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,300 -rrb- from the german government before the berlin regional court for damages incurred after his " unlawful " transfer to kenya .
the lawsuit contends that the interior , defense , justice and foreign ministries must have been aware that a suspect would likely have no access to medical treatment , sanitary facilities or privacy in a kenyan jail .
according to wallasch 's application to the court , as quoted by the website of german newspaper bild , " the plaintiff finds himself in a cell designed for four men .
however , he shares the cell with nine others . "
it said there was no privacy , and no account was taken of muslim dietary restrictions .
" vegetarian food is only available for medical reasons , so that the plaintiff is forced to eat pork if he is not to starve . "
the german foreign ministry denied that germany took no account of the human rights of alleged pirates . a spokesman said the government checked that standards were maintained .
meanwhile a second suspect , mohamud mohamed h. , has filed an injunction with the berlin administrative court aiming to force the german foreign ministry to cover the costs of a public defender in kenya .
his lawyer , andreas schulz , said his trial was to begin in mombasa on april 22 and he currently has no defense attorney there .
wallasch said another three suspected pirates had hired german lawyers .

he says germany must have known of the unsatisfactory prison conditions in kenya . ali mohamed a.d. was captured by the german navy patrolling the gulf of aden last month when he allegedly tried to seize a freighter , the mv courier .
he was transferred to kenya along with eight other somali suspects for prosecution in the port city of mombasa under an eu agreement with kenya .
his lawyer , oliver wallasch , said his client , who denies involvement in piracy , was seeking 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,300 -rrb- from the german government before the berlin regional court for damages incurred after his " unlawful " transfer to kenya .
the lawsuit contends that the interior , defense , justice and foreign ministries must have been aware that a suspect would likely have no access to medical treatment , sanitary facilities or privacy in a kenyan jail .
according to wallasch 's application to the court , as quoted by the website of german newspaper bild , " the plaintiff finds himself in a cell designed for four men .
however , he shares the cell with nine others . "
it said there was no privacy , and no account was taken of muslim dietary restrictions .
" vegetarian food is only available for medical reasons , so that the plaintiff is forced to eat pork if he is not to starve . "
the german foreign ministry denied that germany took no account of the human rights of alleged pirates . a spokesman said the government checked that standards were maintained .
meanwhile a second suspect , mohamud mohamed h. , has filed an injunction with the berlin administrative court aiming to force the german foreign ministry to cover the costs of a public defender in kenya .
his lawyer , andreas schulz , said his trial was to begin in mombasa on april 22 and he currently has no defense attorney there .
wallasch said another three suspected pirates had hired german lawyers .
kenya and the eu have signed an agreement under which suspected somali pirates who are detained in the course of the eu anti-piracy naval mission off the somali coast are transferred to kenya . a german ship , the hansa stavanger , is currently one of at least 18 ships held by somali pirates .
the german navy has contributed four ships to the eu fleet . mll / nw , ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organization went to great lengths to explain that the loss did not arise from exposure to toxic assets .
in 2007 it recorded a net profit of 2.49 billion euros .
" we have no toxic assets , " cdc 's chief executive officer , augustin de romanet , told reporters on thursday , adding that " the auditors have confirmed that . "
when asked about the influence of the new government sovereign wealth fund fsi on his company , de romanet said : " the fsi was n't imposed upon us ; it subscribed to the expansion of the mission " of cdc , which is to support the french economy .
the cdc receives regulatory deposits from the french government and acts as an investment arm for long-term policy .
the bank said it had set aside 2.082 billion euros for its 17.6-percent holding in franco-belgian financial house dexia and for its 20.1-percent interest in french civil engineering group eiffage .
it also said it had laid out 921 million euros for its portfolio of shares .
the belgian and french governments , as well as cdc , contributed to a 6.4 billion-euro bailout of dexia late last year .
de romanet said he was " very confident " about dexia 's prospects . dfm / pfd , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.04.2009 international community mulls response to somalia 's piracy problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on the us maersk alabama brought the issue to a head with the escalation of piracy off the coast of somalia , the international community is pondering what action to take .
but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .
" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

germany 's two remaining international sides have excellent chances in thursday 's uefa cup matches , having both won their first-leg games .
but if they progress , they 'll meet each other . if the two teams both do advance to the semifinals , it will mean germany is guaranteed a spot in the uefa cup final in istanbul on may 20 .
and such a match-up would be all the more of a treat since the two northern german sides are also local rivals with no love lost .
but for that scenario to come to pass , both teams need to close the deal on the road - hamburg against english premier side manchester city , and bremen versus italian serie a competitors udinese .
bremen should be fairly confident , as their italian opponents are languishing in 12th place in their domestic league .
but werder are only tenth in the bundesliga , and their talented brazilian playmaker diego is touch-and-go ahead of the clash in italy .
what 's more , coach thomas schaaf will have to hope that his inconsistent defense has one of its better evenings .

coach martin jol has no serious injury worries , although hamburg should be aware that city do have a very good home record .
still , the northern germans have been difficult to score against in all competitions this season so there 's no reason why they should n't prevail in manchester .
and even if bremen or hamburg or both should falter on thursday evening , they 'll still be seeing a bit of one another in the coming weeks .
the two rivals meet for a league match next week and clash again in the semifinals of the german cup on may 10 .

germany 's two remaining international sides have excellent chances in thursday 's uefa cup matches , having both won their first-leg games .
but if they progress , they 'll meet each other . if the two teams both do advance to the semifinals , it will mean germany is guaranteed a spot in the uefa cup final in istanbul on may 20 .
and such a match-up would be all the more of a treat since the two northern german sides are also local rivals with no love lost .
but for that scenario to come to pass , both teams need to close the deal on the road - hamburg against english premier side manchester city , and bremen versus italian serie a competitors udinese .
bremen should be fairly confident , as their italian opponents are languishing in 12th place in their domestic league .
but werder are only tenth in the bundesliga , and their talented brazilian playmaker diego is touch-and-go ahead of the clash in italy .
what 's more , coach thomas schaaf will have to hope that his inconsistent defense has one of its better evenings .

coach martin jol has no serious injury worries , although hamburg should be aware that city do have a very good home record .
still , the northern germans have been difficult to score against in all competitions this season so there 's no reason why they should n't prevail in manchester .
and even if bremen or hamburg or both should falter on thursday evening , they 'll still be seeing a bit of one another in the coming weeks .
the two rivals meet for a league match next week and clash again in the semifinals of the german cup on may 10 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.04.2009 international community mulls response to somalia 's piracy problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on the us maersk alabama brought the issue to a head with the escalation of piracy off the coast of somalia , the international community is pondering what action to take .
but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .
" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

that could mean the withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops from the republic which has suffered two separatist wars in the past 15 years . the cancellation was ordered by russian president dmitry medvedev and took effect thursday morning , according to a statement from the national anti-terrorist committee .
a spokesman for the committee , which has responsibility for the region , said the decision is aimed at further normalizing the situation there , and restoring and developing its economic and social infrastructure .
restrictions such as curfews , roadblocks , spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in chechnya in 1999 when russia sent troops to the region to end the north caucasus republic 's short-lived independence , which it won in an earlier war with moscow . critics say the special regime , which also includes restricted access for journalists , has fostered huge violations of human rights .
over the past 10 years the pro-moscow regional administration led by former rebel ramzan kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance . kadyrov says chechnya today is stable and has put behind it the violence which claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994 .
kadyrov has long wanted to ease both the restrictions and slacken moscow 's grip on the region .
russia has already withdrawn most of its army units from chechnya but tens of thousands of police from other russian regions and scores of special service units still patrol there .
interior ministry spokesman col. vasily panchenkov said last month that ending the regime could lead to the withdrawal of about 20,000 ministry troops from chechnya .
but panchenkov said at least one interior ministry brigade and a division of military troops would remain in the republic . mll / ncy , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

restrictions such as curfews , roadblocks , spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in chechnya in 1999 when russia sent troops to the region to end the north caucasus republic 's short-lived independence , which it won in an earlier war with moscow . critics say the special regime , which also includes restricted access for journalists , has fostered huge violations of human rights .
over the past 10 years the pro-moscow regional administration led by former rebel ramzan kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance . kadyrov says chechnya today is stable and has put behind it the violence which claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994 .
kadyrov has long wanted to ease both the restrictions and slacken moscow 's grip on the region .
russia has already withdrawn most of its army units from chechnya but tens of thousands of police from other russian regions and scores of special service units still patrol there .
interior ministry spokesman col. vasily panchenkov said last month that ending the regime could lead to the withdrawal of about 20,000 ministry troops from chechnya .
but panchenkov said at least one interior ministry brigade and a division of military troops would remain in the republic . mll / ncy , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the call was made during his meeting with the visiting us special envoy to the middle east , george mitchell . similar demands have been made of the palestinian authority in the past , but the body says it will only recognize israel as it existed before 1967 , prior to the jewish state seizing control of the west bank and gaza strip in the six day war .
meanwhile , stark differences between us and israeli policies emerged during the first meeting between president barack obama 's middle east envoy and the new israeli leadership which took office in late march .
special envoy george mitchell made it clear washington is aiming for the creation of a palestinian state .
" us policy favors , with respect to the israeli-palestinian conflict , a two-state solution , " mitchell told reporters in jerusalem on thursday .
new tack needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli president shimon peres also met with envoy george mitchell in contrast , israeli officials steered clear of the question of palestinian statehood .
netanyahu said only that the west bank 's economy must first improve before any other steps towards peace can be taken .
new israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman observed that past israeli concessions have led to violence , not peace .
lieberman told reporters that the peace process with the palestinians " had reached a dead end " and that new ideas must be found .
" the traditional approach has so far led to no solutions or results , " lieberman said .
mitchell is expected to travel to the west bank for talks with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas of the fatah party and other officials on friday .

no casualties were reported .
the raid came one day after gaza militants fired a rocket into southern israel .
both israel and the palestinian militant group hamas have failed to observe the ceasefires they announced in mid january to end a deadly 22-day war .
according to a palestinian rights group , nearly 1 , 500 palestinians , including 926 civilians , were killed in the fighting .

that could mean the withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops from the republic which has suffered two separatist wars in the past 15 years . the cancellation was ordered by russian president dmitry medvedev and took effect thursday morning , according to a statement from the national anti-terrorist committee .
a spokesman for the committee , which has responsibility for the region , said the decision is aimed at further normalizing the situation there , and restoring and developing its economic and social infrastructure .
restrictions such as curfews , roadblocks , spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in chechnya in 1999 when russia sent troops to the region to end the north caucasus republic 's short-lived independence , which it won in an earlier war with moscow . critics say the special regime , which also includes restricted access for journalists , has fostered huge violations of human rights .
over the past 10 years the pro-moscow regional administration led by former rebel ramzan kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance . kadyrov says chechnya today is stable and has put behind it the violence which claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994 .
kadyrov has long wanted to ease both the restrictions and slacken moscow 's grip on the region .
russia has already withdrawn most of its army units from chechnya but tens of thousands of police from other russian regions and scores of special service units still patrol there .
interior ministry spokesman col. vasily panchenkov said last month that ending the regime could lead to the withdrawal of about 20,000 ministry troops from chechnya .
but panchenkov said at least one interior ministry brigade and a division of military troops would remain in the republic . mll / ncy , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move will delay his deportation to germany for trial by at least one week . the appeals court asked the justice department to detail its plans to transport the 89-year-old retired auto worker .
the court also demanded the state provide " the report of the doctor which forms the basis for its conclusion that the petitioner 's medical condition is such that he is stable enough to travel safely . "
german authorities allege that the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , then 23 , worked for seven months in 1943 as a guard at the sobibor concentration camp in poland .
at least 29,000 jews died at the camp during that time .
prosecutors in munich issued an arrest warrant for him three weeks ago .
however the us court of appeals in cincinnati , ohio , granted demjanjuk a stay on his deportation order on tuesday , april 14 , hours after federal agents removed him from his home in the cleveland suburb of seven hills in anticipation of sending him to germany .
demjanjuk has maintained his innocence of all charges .
he says he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
german resignation the stayed deportation has thrown a spotlight on the deference of many germans towards the case .
more than 60 years since the end of world war ii , which few alive lived through , the desire to see nazi era war criminals face justice is still present .
but according to bernd wagner from berlin 's center for democratic culture , demjanjuk is largely viewed as just one cog in a complex machine that spread horror throughout europe , and which is slowly fading to the recesses of german public consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 89-year-old is alleged to have worked in a nazi concentration camp wagner said the current generation of young germans were less emotional about world war ii than their parents and felt the country needed to move on from its troubled history .
" there 's a widely held view we should draw a line under this chapter of the past , " wagner told news agency reuters .
trial questioned demjanjuk 's lawyers are arguing that he is too ill to stand trial and that his medical condition would worsen in incarceration .
this has led many in germany to question the purpose his trial would serve , klaus-peter schoeppner , head of pollsters emnid , told reuters .
" the share of germans who , in the third generation , want to draw a line under the past and not deal with the guilt question all the time has increased massively over past years , " schoeppner said .
however , this has not swayed german authorities , who feel that if demjanjuk is judged fit to stand trial then he should be made to do so .
" this is not about revenge but about clearing things up and justice , " a spokesman for the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats said .
" it is also a matter of working through our history . "
joerg van essen of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- said germany was still obligated to ensure that nazi era war criminals were brought to justice .

he says he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
german resignation the stayed deportation has thrown a spotlight on the deference of many germans towards the case .
more than 60 years since the end of world war ii , which few alive lived through , the desire to see nazi era war criminals face justice is still present .
but according to bernd wagner from berlin 's center for democratic culture , demjanjuk is largely viewed as just one cog in a complex machine that spread horror throughout europe , and which is slowly fading to the recesses of german public consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 89-year-old is alleged to have worked in a nazi concentration camp wagner said the current generation of young germans were less emotional about world war ii than their parents and felt the country needed to move on from its troubled history .
" there 's a widely held view we should draw a line under this chapter of the past , " wagner told news agency reuters .
trial questioned demjanjuk 's lawyers are arguing that he is too ill to stand trial and that his medical condition would worsen in incarceration .
this has led many in germany to question the purpose his trial would serve , klaus-peter schoeppner , head of pollsters emnid , told reuters .
" the share of germans who , in the third generation , want to draw a line under the past and not deal with the guilt question all the time has increased massively over past years , " schoeppner said .
however , this has not swayed german authorities , who feel that if demjanjuk is judged fit to stand trial then he should be made to do so .
" this is not about revenge but about clearing things up and justice , " a spokesman for the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats said .
" it is also a matter of working through our history . "

the move will delay his deportation to germany for trial by at least one week . the appeals court asked the justice department to detail its plans to transport the 89-year-old retired auto worker .
the court also demanded the state provide " the report of the doctor which forms the basis for its conclusion that the petitioner 's medical condition is such that he is stable enough to travel safely . "
german authorities allege that the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , then 23 , worked for seven months in 1943 as a guard at the sobibor concentration camp in poland .
at least 29,000 jews died at the camp during that time .
prosecutors in munich issued an arrest warrant for him three weeks ago .

he said the situation would change only if producers received low-interest grants from the german government or advance payments from the european union .
in addition , sonnleitner demanded that supermarkets stop gagging milk producers and assume greater social responsibility .
" german consumers are shopping more economically , " sonnleitner said .
in addition , agriculture exports have decreased dramatically .
his calls are being echoed by bavarian agriculture minister helmut brunner , who has said that chancellor angela merkel needs to give the issue " top priority . "
" with the price of butter lower than it was after the war , surely consumers must also realize that something is not right , " brunner said .
current milk prices stand at about 25 cents per liter , which is 13 cents less than this time last year .
germany 's milk producers ' union , bdm , estimates that it costs approximately 40 cents to produce one liter of milk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers say the price they get is below the cost of producing a liter of milk nationwide protests the calls came as dairy farmers across germany were gearing up for a series of protests .
" the milk producers ' demonstrations show what an emergency this is .
in the long run , no business can live on 24 cents or less for a liter of milk , " said kirsten tackmann , agriculture spokeswoman for the left party .
" a new summit focused on milk prices only makes sense if it really truly leads to effective , binding prices changes , " she said .
dairy producer johann burfeind said he is seeking dialogue .
" it 's about safeguarding our future … we need an arrangement that restricts overproduction , which causes prices to fall , " burfeind said .
earlier this month , dairy farmers from several nations rallied in prague against low milk prices and eu rates .
cut quotas the german farmers ' association is demanding that the eu milk quota be reduced by two to three percent .
just this month though , the eu voted to increase the quota by one percent , and plans to have production limits completely abolished from 2015 .
meanwhile , german agriculture minister ilse aigner told the rheinische post newspaper that round table discussions would be held on april 28 to discuss the nation 's milk prices . cg / pfd , afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.04.2009 german designer makes edgy urban fashion for young muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion label founder melih kesmen was looking for a way to express his faith it all started with a t-shirt bearing the slogan " i love my prophet . "
that 's when a designer in germany discovered a booming market for modern , urban clothes and accessories with a muslim message . people from many different cultures are likely to agree : slippers are rather uncool .
but in styleislam 's fashion design office , everyone walks around in them .
here , in the small german town of witten in the middle of the industrial ruhr region , chic clothes and accessories are designed for fashion-conscious but devout young muslims . styleislam was the brainchild of melih kesmen , a stocky man with a ponytail and goatee . " here are a few examples of our designs , like one about the hijab - the headscarf , " he said , pulling a black handbag out of a cupboard in the company 's small stockroom . " hijab , my right , my choice , my life , " is written on the bag in big white letters . " if a woman wants to wear a headscarf , then she should be allowed to , " said kesmen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if women want to wear headscarves , they should , says kesmen the motto on the bag could provoke hours of discussion , and so could plenty of other motifs on the entrepreneur 's shelves , such as baby bibs printed with the word " minimuslim " or a call to prayer : " salah , always get connected . " a different kind of response the project began three years ago , as the scandal raged over caricatures of the prophet muhammad printed in a danish newspaper .
at the time , kesmen was living in london with his wife yeliz . " the publication of the drawings bothered me , but i was also really annoyed by the reaction from our side , the muslim side , " said kesmen .
in many muslim countries around the world , violent demonstrations were held and danish flags were burned . " so i thought , there must be a way to respond creatively and productively , in a peaceful way , " added kesmen .
and he found one : he had a t-shirt printed with the slogan " i love my prophet . " so many people literally wanted to buy the shirt off of his back that kesmen , who is trained as a graphic designer , recognized the untapped market for trendy clothes with a muslim message . welcome to the ummah after moving back to his hometown , witten , he took action and the young company 's product line and profit have been growing ever since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muhammad cartoons , which were republished in 2008 , caused a stir in the muslim world " the label pays for itself now , " said kesmen , who advertizes that one euro per shirt sold is donated to an orphanage in africa . kesmen does n't just encourage religious faithfulness among his customers , but also in the workplace .
when hiring women , he prefers those who wear a headscarf .
and regular prayer breaks are taken in the office - which is why everyone wears slippers instead of shoes . germany 's most well-known muslim rapper , ammar 114 , advertizes for styleislam , which has boosted the labels popularity among young believers . one of them is salman sagir of berlin , whose parents are from pakistan .
his shirt , with the slogan " ummah - be part of it , " was tight across his muscular shoulders .
he did n't seem bothered that curious passersby examined his chest bearing the invitation to join the ummah , the muslim community . " hopefully styleislam will come out with more sizes soon , " said sagir . t-shirts to get people talking though many of styleislam 's slogans are designed to show positive sides to islam , they are n't necessarily accessible to non-muslims , as some of the phrases include islamic concepts or are written in turkish . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : styleislam 's slogans are meant to spark conversation " if someone does n't understand , maybe it 'll make them curious and it will spark a conversation about the phrase , " said kesmen .
the company also has an explanation for each slogan on its website , styleislam.com. sometimes explanations are necessary - styleislam 's slogans can be ironic , cheeky or even downright provocative . kesmen got threatening phone calls over the slogan " jesus was a muslim . "
he defends it , saying : " jesus was one of the greatest prophets in islam and his message was n't actually any different than the prophet muhammad 's .

the move will delay his deportation to germany for trial by at least one week . the appeals court asked the justice department to detail its plans to transport the 89-year-old retired auto worker .
the court also demanded the state provide " the report of the doctor which forms the basis for its conclusion that the petitioner 's medical condition is such that he is stable enough to travel safely . "
german authorities allege that the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , then 23 , worked for seven months in 1943 as a guard at the sobibor concentration camp in poland .
at least 29,000 jews died at the camp during that time .
prosecutors in munich issued an arrest warrant for him three weeks ago .
however the us court of appeals in cincinnati , ohio , granted demjanjuk a stay on his deportation order on tuesday , april 14 , hours after federal agents removed him from his home in the cleveland suburb of seven hills in anticipation of sending him to germany .
demjanjuk has maintained his innocence of all charges .
he says he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
german resignation the stayed deportation has thrown a spotlight on the deference of many germans towards the case .
more than 60 years since the end of world war ii , which few alive lived through , the desire to see nazi era war criminals face justice is still present .
but according to bernd wagner from berlin 's center for democratic culture , demjanjuk is largely viewed as just one cog in a complex machine that spread horror throughout europe , and which is slowly fading to the recesses of german public consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 89-year-old is alleged to have worked in a nazi concentration camp wagner said the current generation of young germans were less emotional about world war ii than their parents and felt the country needed to move on from its troubled history .
" there 's a widely held view we should draw a line under this chapter of the past , " wagner told news agency reuters .
trial questioned demjanjuk 's lawyers are arguing that he is too ill to stand trial and that his medical condition would worsen in incarceration .
this has led many in germany to question the purpose his trial would serve , klaus-peter schoeppner , head of pollsters emnid , told reuters .
" the share of germans who , in the third generation , want to draw a line under the past and not deal with the guilt question all the time has increased massively over past years , " schoeppner said .
however , this has not swayed german authorities , who feel that if demjanjuk is judged fit to stand trial then he should be made to do so .
" this is not about revenge but about clearing things up and justice , " a spokesman for the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats said .
" it is also a matter of working through our history . "
joerg van essen of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- said germany was still obligated to ensure that nazi era war criminals were brought to justice .

both teams sewed up uefa cup quarter-final wins , setting up an all-german semi-final tie .
the two sides will meet in the german cup semi-final , as well as once more in the league .
bremen carried a 3-1 first-leg lead into their match in udine , and were put on their heels in the 15th minute when turkish international gokhan inler put the home side ahead 1-0 .
bremen 's talismanic brazilian number ten diego evened the scoreline in the 28th minute , but fabio quagliarella added two more for the italians before half-time , meaning the tie was on a knife 's edge at the break .
quagliarella nearly made it three in the early stages of the second half , turning a shot just wide of the post .
diego , though , turned the match in the 60th minute when he headed in a rebound off the post from a hugo almeida shot .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored another for bremen in the 73rd minute , putting the match on ice – and bremen through .

italian referee nicola rizzoli had adjudged , rather questionably to many viewers , that piotr trochowski had handled an elano cross .
from then on city went on the attack , and they very nearly took the lead through a elano free kick in the 42nd minute that hit the crossbar .
five minutes into the second half , city were up 2-1 as beefy ecuadorian striker felipe caicedo beat hamburg keeper frank rost from close range .
hamburg fans then spent 40 very long minutes watching their team do little but defend their slim aggregate lead .
in one of their few forward forays , however , hamburg caught a big break .
with 15 minutes to go , city captain richard dunne committed a rash late challenge on hamburg 's dennis aogo .
he had been booked early on , and thus was sent off .

both teams sewed up uefa cup quarter-final wins , setting up an all-german semi-final tie .
the two sides will meet in the german cup semi-final , as well as once more in the league .
bremen carried a 3-1 first-leg lead into their match in udine , and were put on their heels in the 15th minute when turkish international gokhan inler put the home side ahead 1-0 .
bremen 's talismanic brazilian number ten diego evened the scoreline in the 28th minute , but fabio quagliarella added two more for the italians before half-time , meaning the tie was on a knife 's edge at the break .
quagliarella nearly made it three in the early stages of the second half , turning a shot just wide of the post .
diego , though , turned the match in the 60th minute when he headed in a rebound off the post from a hugo almeida shot .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored another for bremen in the 73rd minute , putting the match on ice – and bremen through .
tested in manchester bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dennis aogo and hamburg are still standing like bremen , hamburg went into its away leg at the city of manchester stadium with a 3-1 lead .
and they too were made to work before booking their passage for the semi-finals .
it was a dream start for hamburg as paulo guerrero fired his team in front in the 12th minute .
but the peruvian 's strike was cancelled out just five minutes later as city 's brazil midfielder elano scored from the penalty spot .
italian referee nicola rizzoli had adjudged , rather questionably to many viewers , that piotr trochowski had handled an elano cross .
from then on city went on the attack , and they very nearly took the lead through a elano free kick in the 42nd minute that hit the crossbar .
five minutes into the second half , city were up 2-1 as beefy ecuadorian striker felipe caicedo beat hamburg keeper frank rost from close range .
hamburg fans then spent 40 very long minutes watching their team do little but defend their slim aggregate lead .
in one of their few forward forays , however , hamburg caught a big break .
with 15 minutes to go , city captain richard dunne committed a rash late challenge on hamburg 's dennis aogo .
he had been booked early on , and thus was sent off .
from then on it was a more equal affair , but neither team scored . renewing acquaintances hamburg and bremen 's wins mean the two sides will square off four more times in the next three and a half weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll be getting to know each other even better this coming wednesday , hamburg hosts bremen in the semifinal of the german cup , the dfb pokal .
the two teams then play home and away to each other on the 30th of april and the 7th of may .
and just three days later , on may 10th , they play again , this time in bremen .
the other half in the other two uefa cup quarterfinals , ukrainian sides polished off french opponents .
niether dynamo kyiv nor paris saint-germain had scored in their encounter last week in paris , and thus both had all to play for in the ukrainian capital .
but only one team showed up – dynamo , who were 2-0 up after just over a quarter of an hour and cruised to a 3-0 win .
meanwhile in marseille , shakhtar donetsk took down olympique 2-1 , winning the tie 4-1 on aggregate . mrh / nt , uefa / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organization went to great lengths to explain that the loss did not arise from exposure to toxic assets .
in 2007 it recorded a net profit of 2.49 billion euros .
" we have no toxic assets , " cdc 's chief executive officer , augustin de romanet , told reporters on thursday , adding that " the auditors have confirmed that . "
when asked about the influence of the new government sovereign wealth fund fsi on his company , de romanet said : " the fsi was n't imposed upon us ; it subscribed to the expansion of the mission " of cdc , which is to support the french economy .
the cdc receives regulatory deposits from the french government and acts as an investment arm for long-term policy .
the bank said it had set aside 2.082 billion euros for its 17.6-percent holding in franco-belgian financial house dexia and for its 20.1-percent interest in french civil engineering group eiffage .
it also said it had laid out 921 million euros for its portfolio of shares .
the belgian and french governments , as well as cdc , contributed to a 6.4 billion-euro bailout of dexia late last year .
de romanet said he was " very confident " about dexia 's prospects . dfm / pfd , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report also said that couples would be entitled to a 600-euro bonus and that all 30 million german taxpayers would be eligible for the payment .
around three billion euros - to be taken from a new stock exchange tax - would be made available for the bonus scheme .

the chairman of the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would only complicate people 's taxes , labeling it " the worst form of rip off . "

while team obama is officially on a mission to create a new dialogue between the northern and southern parts of the american continent , one issue in particular is likely to dominate proceedings : cuba .
when it comes to us relations with latin america , cuba is always the elephant in the room .
despite not actually being in the room – cuba has not been invited to friday 's gathering – ending the long-standing enmity between washington and havana and the 47-year-old us economic embargo is expected to be the issue on everyone 's lips .
this is true before the summit has even started .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , who has developed close personal ties with cuba 's ruling castro brothers and has long sought to limit us influence in latin america , made it clear he would push cuba 's case at the summit .
" why is cuba not at the summit of the americas ? " he asked on monday .
" this is one of the main questions that from now on will resonate in trinidad . "
chavez said he would " demand that the empire -lrb- the united states -rrb- run by obama lift the blockade on cuba . "
ecuadorian president rafael correa also indicated that he would use part of his five-minute speech at the summit to blast the embargo .
cuba , he said , " can not continue to be excluded from the inter-american system – that 's barbaric . "
white house officials expect a certain amount of dialogue on cuba but they hope that more time at the summit will be devoted to their own aim of setting a new tone for relations between the united states and latin america .
washington would much rather concentrate on economic reforms , renewable energy , public safety and the fight against drug trafficking – not to mention measures to tackle the global economic crisis .
but if obama and his team arrive hoping that the summit is not distracted by the cuban issue , they are likely to have those hopes dashed .
traditional enmity over us power and influence while it remains to be seen whether this summit will produce the kind of clashes provoked during george w. bush 's tenure , many observers believe that obama is about to find out just how far his enormous goodwill and popularity in most of latin america will stretch – and cuba may just be the snapping point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castros have the support of the majority of latin america " the cuba issue is very important to latin american societies , " tom carothers , the vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , told deutsche welle .
" it 's a symbolic issue , which represents the continuation of the traditional image of the us standing on the neck of some latin american governments .
so it sets a tone that inhibits the united states ' position in the region . "
the cuba issue was high on the agenda when latin american and caribbean nations met at a summit in brazil in december where they agreed the ongoing embargo against cuba was unjust and unnecessary , and should go .
this is a regional attitude that has not been lost on the new president .
obama attempted to defuse tensions on cuba and moved to calm the region in general by announcing earlier this week that he was lifting curbs on travel and money transfers by cuban-americans to the communist-ruled island .
" i think the obama administration correctly perceived that by making an announcement a week before the summit that they 're really starting a process of positive change in us relations with cuba , " carothers said .
" the americans hope to send a signal to governments and people in latin america that they would like to reposition the us much more generally in the region .
us will only go so far without cuban incentives , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing travel to cuba is a first step in the new us policy " i think the us is ready to go quite far if it gets some positive response from cuba , " carothers added .
" already they have , to some extent , put the ball in the court of the castros , although the cuban government might not feel that way yet .
but the region is now curious , turning its attention to the cuban government and saying ' now you have a positive signal from the united states , what 's your reaction ? '
so this is a change after 50 years of the region waiting for the united states to make a move . "
but while the new administration may have extended a hand , experts believe a full embrace is still some distance away .
washington remains unmoved on the issue of the embargo as long as cuba remains undemocratic and imprisons political dissidents .
on thursday , obama called on havana to send a signal that there will be " changes in how cuba operates " to prompt a thaw in relations , ahead of the summit .
he called for political prisoners to be released and free speech to be allowed in order to " see a further thawing of relations " between the us and its long-time communist foe .
" if the obama administration feels that it can get some positive reaction back from the cuban government , they could engage in a direct discussion , which might allow further steps , " carothers said .
" however , i think the administration is unlikely to take a further unilateral step to ease sanctions without getting at least something back from the other side . "
obama hoping to reverse eight years of perceived neglect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has already reached out to leaders like brazil 's lula whether obama 's step-by-step policy towards cuba will be enough to satisfy his critics in latin america remains to be seen .
the us president may have to offer concrete assurances on a number of other pressing issues if he is to convince his neighbors he 's offering ' change they can believe in . '
" this summit has a lot of economic and social issues to deal with , " tom carothers said .
" there is the global financial crisis which is both a common issue and also an issue of division , as the latin americans blame the us ; then there is the on-going desire to improve and deepen free trade in the region as well as the hope for more us involvement in the war on drugs and some us movement on immigration reform .
" but we should see this summit in a broader context , " he added .
" we have a new american president trying to change the tone of relations and also change the impression in latin america that the united states has been neglecting the region for the last eight years . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 16.04.2009 latin americans to challenge obama on his new cuban policy shift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has extended a hand to cuba but latin america wants more us president barack obama heads to the summit of the americas friday expecting to face calls from his latin american counterparts to relax the economic embargo on cuba and improve relations . barely a week after his first , frenetic overseas trip , us president barack obama is to fly into trinidad and tobago for the 34-leader summit of the americas on friday .
while team obama is officially on a mission to create a new dialogue between the northern and southern parts of the american continent , one issue in particular is likely to dominate proceedings : cuba .
when it comes to us relations with latin america , cuba is always the elephant in the room .
despite not actually being in the room – cuba has not been invited to friday 's gathering – ending the long-standing enmity between washington and havana and the 47-year-old us economic embargo is expected to be the issue on everyone 's lips .
this is true before the summit has even started .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , who has developed close personal ties with cuba 's ruling castro brothers and has long sought to limit us influence in latin america , made it clear he would push cuba 's case at the summit .
" why is cuba not at the summit of the americas ? " he asked on monday .
" this is one of the main questions that from now on will resonate in trinidad . "
chavez said he would " demand that the empire -lrb- the united states -rrb- run by obama lift the blockade on cuba . "
ecuadorian president rafael correa also indicated that he would use part of his five-minute speech at the summit to blast the embargo .
cuba , he said , " can not continue to be excluded from the inter-american system – that 's barbaric . "
white house officials expect a certain amount of dialogue on cuba but they hope that more time at the summit will be devoted to their own aim of setting a new tone for relations between the united states and latin america .
washington would much rather concentrate on economic reforms , renewable energy , public safety and the fight against drug trafficking – not to mention measures to tackle the global economic crisis .
but if obama and his team arrive hoping that the summit is not distracted by the cuban issue , they are likely to have those hopes dashed .
traditional enmity over us power and influence while it remains to be seen whether this summit will produce the kind of clashes provoked during george w. bush 's tenure , many observers believe that obama is about to find out just how far his enormous goodwill and popularity in most of latin america will stretch – and cuba may just be the snapping point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castros have the support of the majority of latin america " the cuba issue is very important to latin american societies , " tom carothers , the vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , told deutsche welle .
" it 's a symbolic issue , which represents the continuation of the traditional image of the us standing on the neck of some latin american governments .
so it sets a tone that inhibits the united states ' position in the region . "
the cuba issue was high on the agenda when latin american and caribbean nations met at a summit in brazil in december where they agreed the ongoing embargo against cuba was unjust and unnecessary , and should go .
this is a regional attitude that has not been lost on the new president .
obama attempted to defuse tensions on cuba and moved to calm the region in general by announcing earlier this week that he was lifting curbs on travel and money transfers by cuban-americans to the communist-ruled island .
" i think the obama administration correctly perceived that by making an announcement a week before the summit that they 're really starting a process of positive change in us relations with cuba , " carothers said .
" the americans hope to send a signal to governments and people in latin america that they would like to reposition the us much more generally in the region .
us will only go so far without cuban incentives , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing travel to cuba is a first step in the new us policy " i think the us is ready to go quite far if it gets some positive response from cuba , " carothers added .
" already they have , to some extent , put the ball in the court of the castros , although the cuban government might not feel that way yet .
but the region is now curious , turning its attention to the cuban government and saying ' now you have a positive signal from the united states , what 's your reaction ? '
so this is a change after 50 years of the region waiting for the united states to make a move . "
but while the new administration may have extended a hand , experts believe a full embrace is still some distance away .
washington remains unmoved on the issue of the embargo as long as cuba remains undemocratic and imprisons political dissidents .
on thursday , obama called on havana to send a signal that there will be " changes in how cuba operates " to prompt a thaw in relations , ahead of the summit .
he called for political prisoners to be released and free speech to be allowed in order to " see a further thawing of relations " between the us and its long-time communist foe .
" if the obama administration feels that it can get some positive reaction back from the cuban government , they could engage in a direct discussion , which might allow further steps , " carothers said .
" however , i think the administration is unlikely to take a further unilateral step to ease sanctions without getting at least something back from the other side . "
obama hoping to reverse eight years of perceived neglect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has already reached out to leaders like brazil 's lula whether obama 's step-by-step policy towards cuba will be enough to satisfy his critics in latin america remains to be seen .
the us president may have to offer concrete assurances on a number of other pressing issues if he is to convince his neighbors he 's offering ' change they can believe in . '
" this summit has a lot of economic and social issues to deal with , " tom carothers said .
" there is the global financial crisis which is both a common issue and also an issue of division , as the latin americans blame the us ; then there is the on-going desire to improve and deepen free trade in the region as well as the hope for more us involvement in the war on drugs and some us movement on immigration reform .
" but we should see this summit in a broader context , " he added .
" we have a new american president trying to change the tone of relations and also change the impression in latin america that the united states has been neglecting the region for the last eight years . "

he said the situation would change only if producers received low-interest grants from the german government or advance payments from the european union .
in addition , sonnleitner demanded that supermarkets stop gagging milk producers and assume greater social responsibility .
" german consumers are shopping more economically , " sonnleitner said .
in addition , agriculture exports have decreased dramatically .
his calls are being echoed by bavarian agriculture minister helmut brunner , who has said that chancellor angela merkel needs to give the issue " top priority . "
" with the price of butter lower than it was after the war , surely consumers must also realize that something is not right , " brunner said .
current milk prices stand at about 25 cents per liter , which is 13 cents less than this time last year .
germany 's milk producers ' union , bdm , estimates that it costs approximately 40 cents to produce one liter of milk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers say the price they get is below the cost of producing a liter of milk nationwide protests the calls came as dairy farmers across germany were gearing up for a series of protests .
" the milk producers ' demonstrations show what an emergency this is .
in the long run , no business can live on 24 cents or less for a liter of milk , " said kirsten tackmann , agriculture spokeswoman for the left party .
" a new summit focused on milk prices only makes sense if it really truly leads to effective , binding prices changes , " she said .
dairy producer johann burfeind said he is seeking dialogue .
" it 's about safeguarding our future … we need an arrangement that restricts overproduction , which causes prices to fall , " burfeind said .
earlier this month , dairy farmers from several nations rallied in prague against low milk prices and eu rates .
cut quotas the german farmers ' association is demanding that the eu milk quota be reduced by two to three percent .
just this month though , the eu voted to increase the quota by one percent , and plans to have production limits completely abolished from 2015 .
meanwhile , german agriculture minister ilse aigner told the rheinische post newspaper that round table discussions would be held on april 28 to discuss the nation 's milk prices . cg / pfd , afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany urges eu action to halt plunging milk prices last summer , german farmers launched a series of " milk strikes " to protest falling prices .

the call was made during his meeting with the visiting us special envoy to the middle east , george mitchell . similar demands have been made of the palestinian authority in the past , but the body says it will only recognize israel as it existed before 1967 , prior to the jewish state seizing control of the west bank and gaza strip in the six day war .
meanwhile , stark differences between us and israeli policies emerged during the first meeting between president barack obama 's middle east envoy and the new israeli leadership which took office in late march .
special envoy george mitchell made it clear washington is aiming for the creation of a palestinian state .
" us policy favors , with respect to the israeli-palestinian conflict , a two-state solution , " mitchell told reporters in jerusalem on thursday .
new tack needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli president shimon peres also met with envoy george mitchell in contrast , israeli officials steered clear of the question of palestinian statehood .
netanyahu said only that the west bank 's economy must first improve before any other steps towards peace can be taken .
new israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman observed that past israeli concessions have led to violence , not peace .
lieberman told reporters that the peace process with the palestinians " had reached a dead end " and that new ideas must be found .
" the traditional approach has so far led to no solutions or results , " lieberman said .
mitchell is expected to travel to the west bank for talks with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas of the fatah party and other officials on friday .
more rocket fire israeli aircraft bombed a house in the gaza strip on thursday - the first strike in more than a month on the densely populated area .
no casualties were reported .
the raid came one day after gaza militants fired a rocket into southern israel .
both israel and the palestinian militant group hamas have failed to observe the ceasefires they announced in mid january to end a deadly 22-day war .
according to a palestinian rights group , nearly 1 , 500 palestinians , including 926 civilians , were killed in the fighting .
israel , however , disputes those figures . cg / pfd , dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the call was made during his meeting with the visiting us special envoy to the middle east , george mitchell . similar demands have been made of the palestinian authority in the past , but the body says it will only recognize israel as it existed before 1967 , prior to the jewish state seizing control of the west bank and gaza strip in the six day war .

the organization went to great lengths to explain that the loss did not arise from exposure to toxic assets .

the cdc receives regulatory deposits from the french government and acts as an investment arm for long-term policy .
the bank said it had set aside 2.082 billion euros for its 17.6-percent holding in franco-belgian financial house dexia and for its 20.1-percent interest in french civil engineering group eiffage .
it also said it had laid out 921 million euros for its portfolio of shares .

the organization went to great lengths to explain that the loss did not arise from exposure to toxic assets .
in 2007 it recorded a net profit of 2.49 billion euros .
" we have no toxic assets , " cdc 's chief executive officer , augustin de romanet , told reporters on thursday , adding that " the auditors have confirmed that . "
when asked about the influence of the new government sovereign wealth fund fsi on his company , de romanet said : " the fsi was n't imposed upon us ; it subscribed to the expansion of the mission " of cdc , which is to support the french economy .
the cdc receives regulatory deposits from the french government and acts as an investment arm for long-term policy .
the bank said it had set aside 2.082 billion euros for its 17.6-percent holding in franco-belgian financial house dexia and for its 20.1-percent interest in french civil engineering group eiffage .
it also said it had laid out 921 million euros for its portfolio of shares .
the belgian and french governments , as well as cdc , contributed to a 6.4 billion-euro bailout of dexia late last year .

that 's when a designer in germany discovered a booming market for modern , urban clothes and accessories with a muslim message . people from many different cultures are likely to agree : slippers are rather uncool .
but in styleislam 's fashion design office , everyone walks around in them .
here , in the small german town of witten in the middle of the industrial ruhr region , chic clothes and accessories are designed for fashion-conscious but devout young muslims . styleislam was the brainchild of melih kesmen , a stocky man with a ponytail and goatee . " here are a few examples of our designs , like one about the hijab - the headscarf , " he said , pulling a black handbag out of a cupboard in the company 's small stockroom .

" if a woman wants to wear a headscarf , then she should be allowed to , " said kesmen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if women want to wear headscarves , they should , says kesmen the motto on the bag could provoke hours of discussion , and so could plenty of other motifs on the entrepreneur 's shelves , such as baby bibs printed with the word " minimuslim " or a call to prayer : " salah , always get connected .

"
that 's when a designer in germany discovered a booming market for modern , urban clothes and accessories with a muslim message . people from many different cultures are likely to agree : slippers are rather uncool .
but in styleislam 's fashion design office , everyone walks around in them .
here , in the small german town of witten in the middle of the industrial ruhr region , chic clothes and accessories are designed for fashion-conscious but devout young muslims . styleislam was the brainchild of melih kesmen , a stocky man with a ponytail and goatee . " here are a few examples of our designs , like one about the hijab - the headscarf , " he said , pulling a black handbag out of a cupboard in the company 's small stockroom . " hijab , my right , my choice , my life , " is written on the bag in big white letters . " if a woman wants to wear a headscarf , then she should be allowed to , " said kesmen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if women want to wear headscarves , they should , says kesmen the motto on the bag could provoke hours of discussion , and so could plenty of other motifs on the entrepreneur 's shelves , such as baby bibs printed with the word " minimuslim " or a call to prayer : " salah , always get connected . " a different kind of response the project began three years ago , as the scandal raged over caricatures of the prophet muhammad printed in a danish newspaper .
at the time , kesmen was living in london with his wife yeliz . " the publication of the drawings bothered me , but i was also really annoyed by the reaction from our side , the muslim side , " said kesmen .
in many muslim countries around the world , violent demonstrations were held and danish flags were burned . " so i thought , there must be a way to respond creatively and productively , in a peaceful way , " added kesmen .

the company also has an explanation for each slogan on its website , styleislam.com. sometimes explanations are necessary - styleislam 's slogans can be ironic , cheeky or even downright provocative . kesmen got threatening phone calls over the slogan " jesus was a muslim . "
he defends it , saying : " jesus was one of the greatest prophets in islam and his message was n't actually any different than the prophet muhammad 's . " while opinions may differ on the matter , kesmen 's aim is to give young muslims a way to combine fashion with their faith and be confident about who they are .

germany 's two remaining international sides have excellent chances in thursday 's uefa cup matches , having both won their first-leg games .
but if they progress , they 'll meet each other . if the two teams both do advance to the semifinals , it will mean germany is guaranteed a spot in the uefa cup final in istanbul on may 20 .

but for that scenario to come to pass , both teams need to close the deal on the road - hamburg against english premier side manchester city , and bremen versus italian serie a competitors udinese .
bremen should be fairly confident , as their italian opponents are languishing in 12th place in their domestic league .

the two rivals meet for a league match next week and clash again in the semifinals of the german cup on may 10 .

he says germany must have known of the unsatisfactory prison conditions in kenya . ali mohamed a.d. was captured by the german navy patrolling the gulf of aden last month when he allegedly tried to seize a freighter , the mv courier .
he was transferred to kenya along with eight other somali suspects for prosecution in the port city of mombasa under an eu agreement with kenya .
his lawyer , oliver wallasch , said his client , who denies involvement in piracy , was seeking 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,300 -rrb- from the german government before the berlin regional court for damages incurred after his " unlawful " transfer to kenya .
the lawsuit contends that the interior , defense , justice and foreign ministries must have been aware that a suspect would likely have no access to medical treatment , sanitary facilities or privacy in a kenyan jail .
according to wallasch 's application to the court , as quoted by the website of german newspaper bild , " the plaintiff finds himself in a cell designed for four men .
however , he shares the cell with nine others . "
it said there was no privacy , and no account was taken of muslim dietary restrictions .
" vegetarian food is only available for medical reasons , so that the plaintiff is forced to eat pork if he is not to starve . "
the german foreign ministry denied that germany took no account of the human rights of alleged pirates . a spokesman said the government checked that standards were maintained .
meanwhile a second suspect , mohamud mohamed h. , has filed an injunction with the berlin administrative court aiming to force the german foreign ministry to cover the costs of a public defender in kenya .
his lawyer , andreas schulz , said his trial was to begin in mombasa on april 22 and he currently has no defense attorney there .
wallasch said another three suspected pirates had hired german lawyers .
kenya and the eu have signed an agreement under which suspected somali pirates who are detained in the course of the eu anti-piracy naval mission off the somali coast are transferred to kenya . a german ship , the hansa stavanger , is currently one of at least 18 ships held by somali pirates .

he says germany must have known of the unsatisfactory prison conditions in kenya . ali mohamed a.d. was captured by the german navy patrolling the gulf of aden last month when he allegedly tried to seize a freighter , the mv courier .
he was transferred to kenya along with eight other somali suspects for prosecution in the port city of mombasa under an eu agreement with kenya .
his lawyer , oliver wallasch , said his client , who denies involvement in piracy , was seeking 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,300 -rrb- from the german government before the berlin regional court for damages incurred after his " unlawful " transfer to kenya .
the lawsuit contends that the interior , defense , justice and foreign ministries must have been aware that a suspect would likely have no access to medical treatment , sanitary facilities or privacy in a kenyan jail .
according to wallasch 's application to the court , as quoted by the website of german newspaper bild , " the plaintiff finds himself in a cell designed for four men .
however , he shares the cell with nine others . "
it said there was no privacy , and no account was taken of muslim dietary restrictions .
" vegetarian food is only available for medical reasons , so that the plaintiff is forced to eat pork if he is not to starve . "
the german foreign ministry denied that germany took no account of the human rights of alleged pirates . a spokesman said the government checked that standards were maintained .
meanwhile a second suspect , mohamud mohamed h. , has filed an injunction with the berlin administrative court aiming to force the german foreign ministry to cover the costs of a public defender in kenya .
his lawyer , andreas schulz , said his trial was to begin in mombasa on april 22 and he currently has no defense attorney there .
wallasch said another three suspected pirates had hired german lawyers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.04.2009 international community mulls response to somalia 's piracy problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on the us maersk alabama brought the issue to a head with the escalation of piracy off the coast of somalia , the international community is pondering what action to take .
but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .
" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.04.2009 international community mulls response to somalia 's piracy problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on the us maersk alabama brought the issue to a head with the escalation of piracy off the coast of somalia , the international community is pondering what action to take .
but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .
" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.04.2009 international community mulls response to somalia 's piracy problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on the us maersk alabama brought the issue to a head with the escalation of piracy off the coast of somalia , the international community is pondering what action to take .
but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .
" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

that could mean the withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops from the republic which has suffered two separatist wars in the past 15 years . the cancellation was ordered by russian president dmitry medvedev and took effect thursday morning , according to a statement from the national anti-terrorist committee .
a spokesman for the committee , which has responsibility for the region , said the decision is aimed at further normalizing the situation there , and restoring and developing its economic and social infrastructure .
restrictions such as curfews , roadblocks , spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in chechnya in 1999 when russia sent troops to the region to end the north caucasus republic 's short-lived independence , which it won in an earlier war with moscow . critics say the special regime , which also includes restricted access for journalists , has fostered huge violations of human rights .
over the past 10 years the pro-moscow regional administration led by former rebel ramzan kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance . kadyrov says chechnya today is stable and has put behind it the violence which claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994 .
kadyrov has long wanted to ease both the restrictions and slacken moscow 's grip on the region .
russia has already withdrawn most of its army units from chechnya but tens of thousands of police from other russian regions and scores of special service units still patrol there .
interior ministry spokesman col. vasily panchenkov said last month that ending the regime could lead to the withdrawal of about 20,000 ministry troops from chechnya .
but panchenkov said at least one interior ministry brigade and a division of military troops would remain in the republic . mll / ncy , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

restrictions such as curfews , roadblocks , spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in chechnya in 1999 when russia sent troops to the region to end the north caucasus republic 's short-lived independence , which it won in an earlier war with moscow . critics say the special regime , which also includes restricted access for journalists , has fostered huge violations of human rights .
over the past 10 years the pro-moscow regional administration led by former rebel ramzan kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance . kadyrov says chechnya today is stable and has put behind it the violence which claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994 .
kadyrov has long wanted to ease both the restrictions and slacken moscow 's grip on the region .
russia has already withdrawn most of its army units from chechnya but tens of thousands of police from other russian regions and scores of special service units still patrol there .
interior ministry spokesman col. vasily panchenkov said last month that ending the regime could lead to the withdrawal of about 20,000 ministry troops from chechnya .
but panchenkov said at least one interior ministry brigade and a division of military troops would remain in the republic . mll / ncy , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its new insignia model is also selling well and has been voted european car of the year for 2009 . news media in the united states are reporting that general motors could file for bankruptcy as early as may .
this means that it would be extremely important for opel to be able to stand alone before gm files for “ chapter 11 ” bankruptcy protection in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel visited opel employees at the end of march moves to save opel have advanced considerably .
german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said he will travel to the gulf region in may , fueling speculation that one of the gulf emirates may take a stake in the carmaker . guttenberg also said that the us and germany were looking at all the options .
“ in a conversation with the us treasury secretary , " the german minister said " we agreed to set up an informal working group to discuss the next steps to be taken . ” debt for patents according to insiders , those steps could include a swap of opel patents for gm debt .
in an extraordinary meeting last friday , opel 's board of directors reportedly reached an agreement , which german public broadcaster ard described as a " lifeboat " for the ruesselsheim-based company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers are convinced they would be better off without gm opel could demand hundreds of millions of dollars from gm for selling technologies to it in 2005 , analysts say , and that would push the us automaker even closer to the brink . instead , the “ lifeboat ” solution means opel would now get back its patents , which are currently in the hands of the us government , and retract its financial demands . this , in turn , would substantially lower gm ’ s debt , making it more interesting to potential investors , while giving opel the tools it needs to continue building cars on its own . jobs better than unemployment german finance minister peer steinbrueck has argued that it makes more sense to save the company and the jobs than to put people out of work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open arms for abu dhabi ?
finance minister peer steinbrueck is looking for investors “ we ’ re talking about 25,000 or 26,000 employees and the same number with the suppliers , plus their families , " steinbrueck said .
" unemployment benefits for them would cost between two and three billion euros .
so , wouldn ’ t it make more sense to keep these people employed ? ” analysts say that part of a solution to gm 's problems could mean breaking up the automaker into separate " good " and " bad " components .
opel and swedish carmaker saab , as “ good ” components , would become independent with only a minority gm stake .
for the “ bad ” , this means phasing out ailing brands , like oldsmobile , and maintaining more successful ones , like chevrolet . “ all we need now , ” says klaus franz , the head of opel ’ s works council , “ is enough time to create an opel-europe . ” gb / pfd , ard / reuters / afp / glp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an extraordinary meeting last friday , opel 's board of directors reportedly reached an agreement , which german public broadcaster ard described as a " lifeboat " for the ruesselsheim-based company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel workers are convinced they would be better off without gm opel could demand hundreds of millions of dollars from gm for selling technologies to it in 2005 , analysts say , and that would push the us automaker even closer to the brink . instead , the “ lifeboat ” solution means opel would now get back its patents , which are currently in the hands of the us government , and retract its financial demands . this , in turn , would substantially lower gm ’ s debt , making it more interesting to potential investors , while giving opel the tools it needs to continue building cars on its own . jobs better than unemployment german finance minister peer steinbrueck has argued that it makes more sense to save the company and the jobs than to put people out of work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open arms for abu dhabi ?
finance minister peer steinbrueck is looking for investors “ we ’ re talking about 25,000 or 26,000 employees and the same number with the suppliers , plus their families , " steinbrueck said .
" unemployment benefits for them would cost between two and three billion euros .
so , wouldn ’ t it make more sense to keep these people employed ? ” analysts say that part of a solution to gm 's problems could mean breaking up the automaker into separate " good " and " bad " components .
opel and swedish carmaker saab , as “ good ” components , would become independent with only a minority gm stake .
for the “ bad ” , this means phasing out ailing brands , like oldsmobile , and maintaining more successful ones , like chevrolet . “ all we need now , ” says klaus franz , the head of opel ’ s works council , “ is enough time to create an opel-europe . ” gb / pfd , ard / reuters / afp / glp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both teams sewed up uefa cup quarter-final wins , setting up an all-german semi-final tie .
the two sides will meet in the german cup semi-final , as well as once more in the league .
bremen carried a 3-1 first-leg lead into their match in udine , and were put on their heels in the 15th minute when turkish international gokhan inler put the home side ahead 1-0 .
bremen 's talismanic brazilian number ten diego evened the scoreline in the 28th minute , but fabio quagliarella added two more for the italians before half-time , meaning the tie was on a knife 's edge at the break .
quagliarella nearly made it three in the early stages of the second half , turning a shot just wide of the post .
diego , though , turned the match in the 60th minute when he headed in a rebound off the post from a hugo almeida shot .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro scored another for bremen in the 73rd minute , putting the match on ice – and bremen through .
tested in manchester bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dennis aogo and hamburg are still standing like bremen , hamburg went into its away leg at the city of manchester stadium with a 3-1 lead .
and they too were made to work before booking their passage for the semi-finals .
it was a dream start for hamburg as paulo guerrero fired his team in front in the 12th minute .
but the peruvian 's strike was cancelled out just five minutes later as city 's brazil midfielder elano scored from the penalty spot .
italian referee nicola rizzoli had adjudged , rather questionably to many viewers , that piotr trochowski had handled an elano cross .
from then on city went on the attack , and they very nearly took the lead through a elano free kick in the 42nd minute that hit the crossbar .
five minutes into the second half , city were up 2-1 as beefy ecuadorian striker felipe caicedo beat hamburg keeper frank rost from close range .
hamburg fans then spent 40 very long minutes watching their team do little but defend their slim aggregate lead .
in one of their few forward forays , however , hamburg caught a big break .

the move will delay his deportation to germany for trial by at least one week . the appeals court asked the justice department to detail its plans to transport the 89-year-old retired auto worker .
the court also demanded the state provide " the report of the doctor which forms the basis for its conclusion that the petitioner 's medical condition is such that he is stable enough to travel safely . "
german authorities allege that the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , then 23 , worked for seven months in 1943 as a guard at the sobibor concentration camp in poland .
at least 29,000 jews died at the camp during that time .
prosecutors in munich issued an arrest warrant for him three weeks ago .
however the us court of appeals in cincinnati , ohio , granted demjanjuk a stay on his deportation order on tuesday , april 14 , hours after federal agents removed him from his home in the cleveland suburb of seven hills in anticipation of sending him to germany .
demjanjuk has maintained his innocence of all charges .
he says he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
german resignation the stayed deportation has thrown a spotlight on the deference of many germans towards the case .
more than 60 years since the end of world war ii , which few alive lived through , the desire to see nazi era war criminals face justice is still present .
but according to bernd wagner from berlin 's center for democratic culture , demjanjuk is largely viewed as just one cog in a complex machine that spread horror throughout europe , and which is slowly fading to the recesses of german public consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 89-year-old is alleged to have worked in a nazi concentration camp wagner said the current generation of young germans were less emotional about world war ii than their parents and felt the country needed to move on from its troubled history .
" there 's a widely held view we should draw a line under this chapter of the past , " wagner told news agency reuters .
trial questioned demjanjuk 's lawyers are arguing that he is too ill to stand trial and that his medical condition would worsen in incarceration .
this has led many in germany to question the purpose his trial would serve , klaus-peter schoeppner , head of pollsters emnid , told reuters .
" the share of germans who , in the third generation , want to draw a line under the past and not deal with the guilt question all the time has increased massively over past years , " schoeppner said .
however , this has not swayed german authorities , who feel that if demjanjuk is judged fit to stand trial then he should be made to do so .
" this is not about revenge but about clearing things up and justice , " a spokesman for the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats said .
" it is also a matter of working through our history . "
joerg van essen of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- said germany was still obligated to ensure that nazi era war criminals were brought to justice .

the move will delay his deportation to germany for trial by at least one week . the appeals court asked the justice department to detail its plans to transport the 89-year-old retired auto worker .
the court also demanded the state provide " the report of the doctor which forms the basis for its conclusion that the petitioner 's medical condition is such that he is stable enough to travel safely . "
german authorities allege that the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , then 23 , worked for seven months in 1943 as a guard at the sobibor concentration camp in poland .
at least 29,000 jews died at the camp during that time .
prosecutors in munich issued an arrest warrant for him three weeks ago .
however the us court of appeals in cincinnati , ohio , granted demjanjuk a stay on his deportation order on tuesday , april 14 , hours after federal agents removed him from his home in the cleveland suburb of seven hills in anticipation of sending him to germany .
demjanjuk has maintained his innocence of all charges .
he says he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
german resignation the stayed deportation has thrown a spotlight on the deference of many germans towards the case .
more than 60 years since the end of world war ii , which few alive lived through , the desire to see nazi era war criminals face justice is still present .
but according to bernd wagner from berlin 's center for democratic culture , demjanjuk is largely viewed as just one cog in a complex machine that spread horror throughout europe , and which is slowly fading to the recesses of german public consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 89-year-old is alleged to have worked in a nazi concentration camp wagner said the current generation of young germans were less emotional about world war ii than their parents and felt the country needed to move on from its troubled history .
" there 's a widely held view we should draw a line under this chapter of the past , " wagner told news agency reuters .
trial questioned demjanjuk 's lawyers are arguing that he is too ill to stand trial and that his medical condition would worsen in incarceration .
this has led many in germany to question the purpose his trial would serve , klaus-peter schoeppner , head of pollsters emnid , told reuters .
" the share of germans who , in the third generation , want to draw a line under the past and not deal with the guilt question all the time has increased massively over past years , " schoeppner said .
however , this has not swayed german authorities , who feel that if demjanjuk is judged fit to stand trial then he should be made to do so .

the report also said that couples would be entitled to a 600-euro bonus and that all 30 million german taxpayers would be eligible for the payment .
around three billion euros - to be taken from a new stock exchange tax - would be made available for the bonus scheme .
an spd spokesman described the reports on thursday as speculation and said that no firm decisions had been taken on the matter .
plan hosed down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen trittin has labeled the plan an expensive gift but the plan has already been talked down by opposition politicians keen to snuff out early spd campaigning for the upcoming federal election .
fdp general-secretary dirk niebel labeled the scheme as typically socialist , while his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said it would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the chairman of the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would only complicate people 's taxes , labeling it " the worst form of rip off . "
the green party 's leading candidate for the bundestag elections , juergen trittin , criticized the plan for being what he described as an expensive gift .
" the money would be more sensibly used to reduce social security contributions , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 16.04.2009 latin americans to challenge obama on his new cuban policy shift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has extended a hand to cuba but latin america wants more us president barack obama heads to the summit of the americas friday expecting to face calls from his latin american counterparts to relax the economic embargo on cuba and improve relations . barely a week after his first , frenetic overseas trip , us president barack obama is to fly into trinidad and tobago for the 34-leader summit of the americas on friday .
while team obama is officially on a mission to create a new dialogue between the northern and southern parts of the american continent , one issue in particular is likely to dominate proceedings : cuba .
when it comes to us relations with latin america , cuba is always the elephant in the room .
despite not actually being in the room – cuba has not been invited to friday 's gathering – ending the long-standing enmity between washington and havana and the 47-year-old us economic embargo is expected to be the issue on everyone 's lips .
this is true before the summit has even started .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , who has developed close personal ties with cuba 's ruling castro brothers and has long sought to limit us influence in latin america , made it clear he would push cuba 's case at the summit .
" why is cuba not at the summit of the americas ? " he asked on monday .
" this is one of the main questions that from now on will resonate in trinidad . "
chavez said he would " demand that the empire -lrb- the united states -rrb- run by obama lift the blockade on cuba . "
ecuadorian president rafael correa also indicated that he would use part of his five-minute speech at the summit to blast the embargo .
cuba , he said , " can not continue to be excluded from the inter-american system – that 's barbaric . "
white house officials expect a certain amount of dialogue on cuba but they hope that more time at the summit will be devoted to their own aim of setting a new tone for relations between the united states and latin america .
washington would much rather concentrate on economic reforms , renewable energy , public safety and the fight against drug trafficking – not to mention measures to tackle the global economic crisis .
but if obama and his team arrive hoping that the summit is not distracted by the cuban issue , they are likely to have those hopes dashed .
traditional enmity over us power and influence while it remains to be seen whether this summit will produce the kind of clashes provoked during george w. bush 's tenure , many observers believe that obama is about to find out just how far his enormous goodwill and popularity in most of latin america will stretch – and cuba may just be the snapping point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castros have the support of the majority of latin america " the cuba issue is very important to latin american societies , " tom carothers , the vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , told deutsche welle .
" it 's a symbolic issue , which represents the continuation of the traditional image of the us standing on the neck of some latin american governments .
so it sets a tone that inhibits the united states ' position in the region . "
the cuba issue was high on the agenda when latin american and caribbean nations met at a summit in brazil in december where they agreed the ongoing embargo against cuba was unjust and unnecessary , and should go .
this is a regional attitude that has not been lost on the new president .
obama attempted to defuse tensions on cuba and moved to calm the region in general by announcing earlier this week that he was lifting curbs on travel and money transfers by cuban-americans to the communist-ruled island .
" i think the obama administration correctly perceived that by making an announcement a week before the summit that they 're really starting a process of positive change in us relations with cuba , " carothers said .
" the americans hope to send a signal to governments and people in latin america that they would like to reposition the us much more generally in the region .
us will only go so far without cuban incentives , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing travel to cuba is a first step in the new us policy " i think the us is ready to go quite far if it gets some positive response from cuba , " carothers added .
" already they have , to some extent , put the ball in the court of the castros , although the cuban government might not feel that way yet .
but the region is now curious , turning its attention to the cuban government and saying ' now you have a positive signal from the united states , what 's your reaction ? '
so this is a change after 50 years of the region waiting for the united states to make a move . "
but while the new administration may have extended a hand , experts believe a full embrace is still some distance away .
washington remains unmoved on the issue of the embargo as long as cuba remains undemocratic and imprisons political dissidents .
on thursday , obama called on havana to send a signal that there will be " changes in how cuba operates " to prompt a thaw in relations , ahead of the summit .
he called for political prisoners to be released and free speech to be allowed in order to " see a further thawing of relations " between the us and its long-time communist foe .
" if the obama administration feels that it can get some positive reaction back from the cuban government , they could engage in a direct discussion , which might allow further steps , " carothers said .
" however , i think the administration is unlikely to take a further unilateral step to ease sanctions without getting at least something back from the other side . "
obama hoping to reverse eight years of perceived neglect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has already reached out to leaders like brazil 's lula whether obama 's step-by-step policy towards cuba will be enough to satisfy his critics in latin america remains to be seen .
the us president may have to offer concrete assurances on a number of other pressing issues if he is to convince his neighbors he 's offering ' change they can believe in . '
" this summit has a lot of economic and social issues to deal with , " tom carothers said .
" there is the global financial crisis which is both a common issue and also an issue of division , as the latin americans blame the us ; then there is the on-going desire to improve and deepen free trade in the region as well as the hope for more us involvement in the war on drugs and some us movement on immigration reform .
" but we should see this summit in a broader context , " he added .
" we have a new american president trying to change the tone of relations and also change the impression in latin america that the united states has been neglecting the region for the last eight years . "

while team obama is officially on a mission to create a new dialogue between the northern and southern parts of the american continent , one issue in particular is likely to dominate proceedings : cuba .
when it comes to us relations with latin america , cuba is always the elephant in the room .
despite not actually being in the room – cuba has not been invited to friday 's gathering – ending the long-standing enmity between washington and havana and the 47-year-old us economic embargo is expected to be the issue on everyone 's lips .
this is true before the summit has even started .
venezuelan president hugo chavez , who has developed close personal ties with cuba 's ruling castro brothers and has long sought to limit us influence in latin america , made it clear he would push cuba 's case at the summit .
" why is cuba not at the summit of the americas ? " he asked on monday .
" this is one of the main questions that from now on will resonate in trinidad . "
chavez said he would " demand that the empire -lrb- the united states -rrb- run by obama lift the blockade on cuba . "
ecuadorian president rafael correa also indicated that he would use part of his five-minute speech at the summit to blast the embargo .
cuba , he said , " can not continue to be excluded from the inter-american system – that 's barbaric . "
white house officials expect a certain amount of dialogue on cuba but they hope that more time at the summit will be devoted to their own aim of setting a new tone for relations between the united states and latin america .
washington would much rather concentrate on economic reforms , renewable energy , public safety and the fight against drug trafficking – not to mention measures to tackle the global economic crisis .
but if obama and his team arrive hoping that the summit is not distracted by the cuban issue , they are likely to have those hopes dashed .
traditional enmity over us power and influence while it remains to be seen whether this summit will produce the kind of clashes provoked during george w. bush 's tenure , many observers believe that obama is about to find out just how far his enormous goodwill and popularity in most of latin america will stretch – and cuba may just be the snapping point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castros have the support of the majority of latin america " the cuba issue is very important to latin american societies , " tom carothers , the vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , told deutsche welle .
" it 's a symbolic issue , which represents the continuation of the traditional image of the us standing on the neck of some latin american governments .
so it sets a tone that inhibits the united states ' position in the region . "
the cuba issue was high on the agenda when latin american and caribbean nations met at a summit in brazil in december where they agreed the ongoing embargo against cuba was unjust and unnecessary , and should go .
this is a regional attitude that has not been lost on the new president .
obama attempted to defuse tensions on cuba and moved to calm the region in general by announcing earlier this week that he was lifting curbs on travel and money transfers by cuban-americans to the communist-ruled island .
" i think the obama administration correctly perceived that by making an announcement a week before the summit that they 're really starting a process of positive change in us relations with cuba , " carothers said .
" the americans hope to send a signal to governments and people in latin america that they would like to reposition the us much more generally in the region .
us will only go so far without cuban incentives , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing travel to cuba is a first step in the new us policy " i think the us is ready to go quite far if it gets some positive response from cuba , " carothers added .
" already they have , to some extent , put the ball in the court of the castros , although the cuban government might not feel that way yet .
but the region is now curious , turning its attention to the cuban government and saying ' now you have a positive signal from the united states , what 's your reaction ? '
so this is a change after 50 years of the region waiting for the united states to make a move . "
but while the new administration may have extended a hand , experts believe a full embrace is still some distance away .
washington remains unmoved on the issue of the embargo as long as cuba remains undemocratic and imprisons political dissidents .
on thursday , obama called on havana to send a signal that there will be " changes in how cuba operates " to prompt a thaw in relations , ahead of the summit .
he called for political prisoners to be released and free speech to be allowed in order to " see a further thawing of relations " between the us and its long-time communist foe .
" if the obama administration feels that it can get some positive reaction back from the cuban government , they could engage in a direct discussion , which might allow further steps , " carothers said .
" however , i think the administration is unlikely to take a further unilateral step to ease sanctions without getting at least something back from the other side . "
obama hoping to reverse eight years of perceived neglect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has already reached out to leaders like brazil 's lula whether obama 's step-by-step policy towards cuba will be enough to satisfy his critics in latin america remains to be seen .
the us president may have to offer concrete assurances on a number of other pressing issues if he is to convince his neighbors he 's offering ' change they can believe in . '
" this summit has a lot of economic and social issues to deal with , " tom carothers said .
" there is the global financial crisis which is both a common issue and also an issue of division , as the latin americans blame the us ; then there is the on-going desire to improve and deepen free trade in the region as well as the hope for more us involvement in the war on drugs and some us movement on immigration reform .
" but we should see this summit in a broader context , " he added .
" we have a new american president trying to change the tone of relations and also change the impression in latin america that the united states has been neglecting the region for the last eight years . "

germany 's two remaining international sides have excellent chances in thursday 's uefa cup matches , having both won their first-leg games .
but if they progress , they 'll meet each other . if the two teams both do advance to the semifinals , it will mean germany is guaranteed a spot in the uefa cup final in istanbul on may 20 .
and such a match-up would be all the more of a treat since the two northern german sides are also local rivals with no love lost .
but for that scenario to come to pass , both teams need to close the deal on the road - hamburg against english premier side manchester city , and bremen versus italian serie a competitors udinese .
bremen should be fairly confident , as their italian opponents are languishing in 12th place in their domestic league .
but werder are only tenth in the bundesliga , and their talented brazilian playmaker diego is touch-and-go ahead of the clash in italy .
what 's more , coach thomas schaaf will have to hope that his inconsistent defense has one of its better evenings .

still , the northern germans have been difficult to score against in all competitions this season so there 's no reason why they should n't prevail in manchester .
and even if bremen or hamburg or both should falter on thursday evening , they 'll still be seeing a bit of one another in the coming weeks .
the two rivals meet for a league match next week and clash again in the semifinals of the german cup on may 10 .

that could mean the withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops from the republic which has suffered two separatist wars in the past 15 years . the cancellation was ordered by russian president dmitry medvedev and took effect thursday morning , according to a statement from the national anti-terrorist committee .
a spokesman for the committee , which has responsibility for the region , said the decision is aimed at further normalizing the situation there , and restoring and developing its economic and social infrastructure .
restrictions such as curfews , roadblocks , spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in chechnya in 1999 when russia sent troops to the region to end the north caucasus republic 's short-lived independence , which it won in an earlier war with moscow . critics say the special regime , which also includes restricted access for journalists , has fostered huge violations of human rights .
over the past 10 years the pro-moscow regional administration led by former rebel ramzan kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance . kadyrov says chechnya today is stable and has put behind it the violence which claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994 .
kadyrov has long wanted to ease both the restrictions and slacken moscow 's grip on the region .
russia has already withdrawn most of its army units from chechnya but tens of thousands of police from other russian regions and scores of special service units still patrol there .
interior ministry spokesman col. vasily panchenkov said last month that ending the regime could lead to the withdrawal of about 20,000 ministry troops from chechnya .
but panchenkov said at least one interior ministry brigade and a division of military troops would remain in the republic . mll / ncy , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.04.2009 international community mulls response to somalia 's piracy problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on the us maersk alabama brought the issue to a head with the escalation of piracy off the coast of somalia , the international community is pondering what action to take .
but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .
" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

he says germany must have known of the unsatisfactory prison conditions in kenya . ali mohamed a.d. was captured by the german navy patrolling the gulf of aden last month when he allegedly tried to seize a freighter , the mv courier .
he was transferred to kenya along with eight other somali suspects for prosecution in the port city of mombasa under an eu agreement with kenya .
his lawyer , oliver wallasch , said his client , who denies involvement in piracy , was seeking 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,300 -rrb- from the german government before the berlin regional court for damages incurred after his " unlawful " transfer to kenya .
the lawsuit contends that the interior , defense , justice and foreign ministries must have been aware that a suspect would likely have no access to medical treatment , sanitary facilities or privacy in a kenyan jail .
according to wallasch 's application to the court , as quoted by the website of german newspaper bild , " the plaintiff finds himself in a cell designed for four men .
however , he shares the cell with nine others . "
it said there was no privacy , and no account was taken of muslim dietary restrictions .
" vegetarian food is only available for medical reasons , so that the plaintiff is forced to eat pork if he is not to starve . "
the german foreign ministry denied that germany took no account of the human rights of alleged pirates . a spokesman said the government checked that standards were maintained .
meanwhile a second suspect , mohamud mohamed h. , has filed an injunction with the berlin administrative court aiming to force the german foreign ministry to cover the costs of a public defender in kenya .
his lawyer , andreas schulz , said his trial was to begin in mombasa on april 22 and he currently has no defense attorney there .

that could mean the withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops from the republic which has suffered two separatist wars in the past 15 years . the cancellation was ordered by russian president dmitry medvedev and took effect thursday morning , according to a statement from the national anti-terrorist committee .
a spokesman for the committee , which has responsibility for the region , said the decision is aimed at further normalizing the situation there , and restoring and developing its economic and social infrastructure .
restrictions such as curfews , roadblocks , spot searches and arbitrary detention were imposed in chechnya in 1999 when russia sent troops to the region to end the north caucasus republic 's short-lived independence , which it won in an earlier war with moscow . critics say the special regime , which also includes restricted access for journalists , has fostered huge violations of human rights .
over the past 10 years the pro-moscow regional administration led by former rebel ramzan kadyrov has subdued large-scale rebel resistance . kadyrov says chechnya today is stable and has put behind it the violence which claimed tens of thousands of lives after war erupted in 1994 .
kadyrov has long wanted to ease both the restrictions and slacken moscow 's grip on the region .
russia has already withdrawn most of its army units from chechnya but tens of thousands of police from other russian regions and scores of special service units still patrol there .
interior ministry spokesman col. vasily panchenkov said last month that ending the regime could lead to the withdrawal of about 20,000 ministry troops from chechnya .
but panchenkov said at least one interior ministry brigade and a division of military troops would remain in the republic . mll / ncy , ap / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says germany must have known of the unsatisfactory prison conditions in kenya . ali mohamed a.d. was captured by the german navy patrolling the gulf of aden last month when he allegedly tried to seize a freighter , the mv courier .
he was transferred to kenya along with eight other somali suspects for prosecution in the port city of mombasa under an eu agreement with kenya .
his lawyer , oliver wallasch , said his client , who denies involvement in piracy , was seeking 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,300 -rrb- from the german government before the berlin regional court for damages incurred after his " unlawful " transfer to kenya .
the lawsuit contends that the interior , defense , justice and foreign ministries must have been aware that a suspect would likely have no access to medical treatment , sanitary facilities or privacy in a kenyan jail .
according to wallasch 's application to the court , as quoted by the website of german newspaper bild , " the plaintiff finds himself in a cell designed for four men .
however , he shares the cell with nine others . "
it said there was no privacy , and no account was taken of muslim dietary restrictions .
" vegetarian food is only available for medical reasons , so that the plaintiff is forced to eat pork if he is not to starve . "
the german foreign ministry denied that germany took no account of the human rights of alleged pirates . a spokesman said the government checked that standards were maintained .
meanwhile a second suspect , mohamud mohamed h. , has filed an injunction with the berlin administrative court aiming to force the german foreign ministry to cover the costs of a public defender in kenya .
his lawyer , andreas schulz , said his trial was to begin in mombasa on april 22 and he currently has no defense attorney there .
wallasch said another three suspected pirates had hired german lawyers .
kenya and the eu have signed an agreement under which suspected somali pirates who are detained in the course of the eu anti-piracy naval mission off the somali coast are transferred to kenya . a german ship , the hansa stavanger , is currently one of at least 18 ships held by somali pirates .

germany 's two remaining international sides have excellent chances in thursday 's uefa cup matches , having both won their first-leg games .
but if they progress , they 'll meet each other . if the two teams both do advance to the semifinals , it will mean germany is guaranteed a spot in the uefa cup final in istanbul on may 20 .
and such a match-up would be all the more of a treat since the two northern german sides are also local rivals with no love lost .
but for that scenario to come to pass , both teams need to close the deal on the road - hamburg against english premier side manchester city , and bremen versus italian serie a competitors udinese .
bremen should be fairly confident , as their italian opponents are languishing in 12th place in their domestic league .
but werder are only tenth in the bundesliga , and their talented brazilian playmaker diego is touch-and-go ahead of the clash in italy .
what 's more , coach thomas schaaf will have to hope that his inconsistent defense has one of its better evenings .
getting to know you bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... and werder bremen in the uefa cup hamburg , with the third-best record in the germany , will also fancy their chances against man city , who are currently in eleventh place in the premier league .
coach martin jol has no serious injury worries , although hamburg should be aware that city do have a very good home record .
still , the northern germans have been difficult to score against in all competitions this season so there 's no reason why they should n't prevail in manchester .
and even if bremen or hamburg or both should falter on thursday evening , they 'll still be seeing a bit of one another in the coming weeks .
the two rivals meet for a league match next week and clash again in the semifinals of the german cup on may 10 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.04.2009 international community mulls response to somalia 's piracy problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on the us maersk alabama brought the issue to a head with the escalation of piracy off the coast of somalia , the international community is pondering what action to take .
but experts say that as long as somalia remains a failed state , piracy will continue . following the botched us incursion in somalia in 1993 , it seemed unlikely that the us - or any other foreign power - would advocate getting involved in another intervention in this failed state in the horn of africa .
but with the escalation in somali pirate attacks on vessels sailing under a multitude of flags - most recently , the us flag - the distant sound of rattling sabres can be heard .
on wednesday , april 15 , secretary of state hillary clinton outlined measures the us will take as part of a new diplomatic initiative to combat piracy .
these include attempts to track and seize the pirates ' assets , expand naval cooperation , and work with shippers to thwart the hijackers that have turned the gulf of aden into the world 's most treacherous waterway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state hillary rodham clinton however , the measures she outlined are being seen largely as symbolic moves while officials mull more comprehensive diplomatic and military action .
according to several us media sources , military plans to deal with the piracy issue have long been in existence .
the new york daily news , for example , recently quoted retired us ambassador robert oakley , who served as special envoy to somalia under the first bush and clinton administrations in the 1990s , as saying that us special operations forces have prepared plans for mounting a land assault .
" our special operations people have been itching to clean them up , " he told the paper .
" so far , no one has let them .
they have plans on the table but are waiting for the green light . "
however , many experts maintain that it would be foolhardy to send troops into a country fraught with instability and warring factions , including a network of islamic extremists known as al-shabab .
somalia has lacked a legally recognized or effective central government since 1991 , the year when its last president , military dictator mohamed siad barre , was deposed in a civil war that erupted in 1988 and is still ongoing .
after his ousting , somalia 's already rudimentary government apparatus disintegrated , plunging the country into lawlessness .
" boots on the ground will not seriously be considered by the international community , " said corinne graff , an expert on failed states at the us think tank the brookings institution .
" the critical task ahead for the international community should be how to break the cycle of violence in order to create sufficient stability on the ground for westerners , including ngos , to operate . "
german politicians call for action the us is not alone in its deliberations on a piracy crackdown .
in germany , the liberal fdp party has called on the german government to respond more robustly to the issue .
fdp parliamentarian helmut koenigshaus told berlin broadcaster rbb inforadio that the deployment of soldiers patrolling the gulf of aden as part of the eu 's anti-piracy atalanta mission needs to be better coordinated .
he said soldiers currently have to stand by helplessly when pirate attacks occur outside their designated areas of activity .
koenigshaus recommended implementing checkpoints at which outgoing ships would be required to register and possibly be checked for weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german politicians says the focus should be on stopping the mother ships fdp defense expert , rainer stinner , however , recommended taking military action against the " mother ships " that harbor the speedboats used so effectively by scores of heavily armed somali pirates . " we just have to make sure that these mother ships are taken out of the equation , " he said , although he did n't elaborate as to how he saw this being done .
a statement made by the german defense ministry earlier this week made it clear that government officials are looking at ways to stop piracy - but not by attacking ships at sea .
instead , defense ministry secretary thomas kossendey said that the government wants the international community to work harder to address the root causes of the piracy problem on land .
" without calming the situation inland , there 's little chance of successfully fighting piracy at sea , " he told deutschlandfunk radio .
he appealed to the international community to lend more support to somalia 's new transitional government .
justice , administration and security structures need to be built up again so that the government can regain control of the country , kossendey said .
leaders from around the world will have an opportunity to formulate an action plan for somalia at an upcoming donor conference in brussels aimed at raising reconstruction funds for the war-torn nation .
it 's also a unique chance for the eu as a whole , said graff .
" the eu has been reluctant to take any initiative in somalia given lack of adequate us leadership to seek to end the conflict , " she said .
" the eu should seize the opportunity of the current attention on somalia and the upcoming donor conference to become more actively involved in somalia , increase desperately needed aid to somalia and help build the capacity of its transitional federal government . "
weak government lacks credibility so far , somalia 's new transitional government , made up of moderate islamists , has not been seen as a reliable partner .
the escalating piracy problem has only served to highlight its ineffectiveness .
however , somali prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke seems hopeful that all the negative publicity generated by the hijackings can be turned into international momentum to bring change to his country .
" we are not being utilized as much as we could be , " he told reporters in a recent interview at the government 's compound in mogadishu .
" we need to fight pirates on land .
we have information about how they function and who they are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirates have amassed widespread popular support fighting the pirates on land will be a difficult task , however , as in the absence of any alternative , viable system of law or order , they 've amassed widespread popular support .
additionally , foreign governments are often viewed with suspicion by many somalis who feel wealthier nations have been taking advantage of the chaos by abusing their coastal waters .
experts estimate that illegal fishing by european and asian countries robs local fishermen of anywhere from $ 300 - $ 400 million -lrb- 227 - 304 million euros -rrb- each year .
during the 2005 tsunami , it also became evident to what extent foreign states were using the somali coastline as a dumping ground for toxic waste , as dozens of barrels of hazardous waste products washed up on the country 's shores .
bronwyn bruton , an international affairs fellow at the us council of foreign relations , says somalis ' awareness of how foreign countries are profiting from their country 's misery has increased the pirates ' popular support .
" piracy is really entrenched in somalia at this point , " she said in an interview published on wednesday .
" this is a problem that is going to take a long-term and complex set of solutions . "
she also advised the us government and its allies to avoid getting involved in any " grand schemes " in somalia .
" we have a limited capacity to influence events in somalia , " she said .
" but we have an almost unlimited capacity to make a mess of things .
if we go in there with guns blazing … the islamist radicals that we fear in that country will definitely profit from it . "

an insider at opel told ard that a " lifeboat " for the ruesselsheim-based company had been found . the board of directors is reported to have focused on patents and the debts that gm has with opel . analysts say that part of a solution to gm 's problems could mean breaking up the automaker into separate " good " and " bad " components .
this would likely lead to the phasing out of ailing branches , such as unsellable brands and factories , and the continuation of successful brands . rainer einenkel , head of opel 's work council , told ard that there are continuing discussions .
" we are deciding on several steps so that we can become independent , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " better without gm : " an opel worker protests earlier this year speculation rife opel could demand millions of dollars from gm for selling it technologies in 2005 , die welt daily reported on thursday . " the best outcome would be the return of the patents , " an opel insider told die welt .
opel currently has enough cash to continue operation independently for the next four months , the newspaper bild reported wednesday .
the paper said one of the main reasons for the funds was the success of a new opel car model , the insignia . klaus franz , opel work council head , told bild that the company 's assets were safe .

he says germany must have known of the unsatisfactory prison conditions in kenya . ali mohamed a.d. was captured by the german navy patrolling the gulf of aden last month when he allegedly tried to seize a freighter , the mv courier .
he was transferred to kenya along with eight other somali suspects for prosecution in the port city of mombasa under an eu agreement with kenya .
his lawyer , oliver wallasch , said his client , who denies involvement in piracy , was seeking 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,300 -rrb- from the german government before the berlin regional court for damages incurred after his " unlawful " transfer to kenya .
the lawsuit contends that the interior , defense , justice and foreign ministries must have been aware that a suspect would likely have no access to medical treatment , sanitary facilities or privacy in a kenyan jail .
according to wallasch 's application to the court , as quoted by the website of german newspaper bild , " the plaintiff finds himself in a cell designed for four men .
however , he shares the cell with nine others . "
it said there was no privacy , and no account was taken of muslim dietary restrictions .
" vegetarian food is only available for medical reasons , so that the plaintiff is forced to eat pork if he is not to starve . "
the german foreign ministry denied that germany took no account of the human rights of alleged pirates . a spokesman said the government checked that standards were maintained .
meanwhile a second suspect , mohamud mohamed h. , has filed an injunction with the berlin administrative court aiming to force the german foreign ministry to cover the costs of a public defender in kenya .
his lawyer , andreas schulz , said his trial was to begin in mombasa on april 22 and he currently has no defense attorney there .
wallasch said another three suspected pirates had hired german lawyers .
kenya and the eu have signed an agreement under which suspected somali pirates who are detained in the course of the eu anti-piracy naval mission off the somali coast are transferred to kenya . a german ship , the hansa stavanger , is currently one of at least 18 ships held by somali pirates .

the patent would protect the breeding of pigs that possess a naturally occurring gene linked to rapid growth .
some 400 protesters parked tractors and herded pigs outside the european patent office in the german city of munich on wednesday .
they also filed an appeal seeking to overturn a 2005 patent application -lrb- patent ep 1651777 -rrb- filed by us biotech giant monsanto , and now owned by newsham choice genetics .
the patent aims to protect a pig breeding process based on genetic analysis .
but critics warn that the patent could be extended to cover the animals ' genes themselves , and farmers fear that they could one day be forced to pay royalties for their traditional livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european patent office is under to pressure to ban animal breeding patents the german states of bavaria and hesse also oppose the patent application and have already signaled their intention to introduce a general ban on all patents covering animals and plants .
the head of the german farming association , gerd sonnleitner , told the passauer neue presse newspaper that the patent was a " threat to free breeding . "
" patents on animals and plants should be generally banned , because it contradicts every basic understanding of farming , that individuals should have monopoly rights on genetic material , " sonnleitner said .
" corporations are always trying to bypass the regulations to achieve access to animals and plants .
for this reason all legal loopholes should be closed at the eu level so large companies do not dictate what is bred and what lands up on consumers ' plates , " he added .
the farmers ' association president also called for more research into so-called green biotechnologies to investigate the risks and opportunities involved . nt / nw , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report also said that couples would be entitled to a 600-euro bonus and that all 30 million german taxpayers would be eligible for the payment .
around three billion euros - to be taken from a new stock exchange tax - would be made available for the bonus scheme .
an spd spokesman described the reports on thursday as speculation and said that no firm decisions had been taken on the matter .
plan hosed down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen trittin has labeled the plan an expensive gift but the plan has already been talked down by opposition politicians keen to snuff out early spd campaigning for the upcoming federal election .
fdp general-secretary dirk niebel labeled the scheme as typically socialist , while his deputy , carl-ludwig thiele , said it would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income .
the chairman of the christian social union party 's association of small and medium businesses , hans michelbach , said the bonus would only complicate people 's taxes , labeling it " the worst form of rip off . "
the green party 's leading candidate for the bundestag elections , juergen trittin , criticized the plan for being what he described as an expensive gift .
" the money would be more sensibly used to reduce social security contributions , " he said .

bbc news -pipe- science & environment -pipe- pet trade puts orangutans at risk bbc news / science & environment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 04:40 gmt , thursday , 16 april 2009 05:40 uk pet trade puts orangutans at risk by richard black environment correspondent , bbc news website the trade in sumatran orangutans for pets shows little sign of decline and is taking the species to the brink of extinction , a report concludes .
compiled by traffic , the international wildlife trade monitoring network , it suggests that more orangutans are being traded than in previous decades .
the species is listed as critically endangered , with only about 7,000 left .
traffic says indonesian authorities need to pursue prosecutions and heavy penalties against illegal traders .
the sumatran orangutan is protected under national laws and international conventions .
but traffic says the authorities rarely prosecute ; and when they do , penalties are mild .
" there is no deterrent for those committing these crimes if they go unpunished , " said chris shepherd , acting director of traffic in southeast asia .
" indonesia has adequate laws ; but without serious penalties , this illegal trade will continue and these species will continue to spiral towards extinction . "
pet rescue the organisation surveyed orangutans , gibbons and other primates in zoos , markets and rehabilitation centres around sumatra .
market traders told investigators that they could procure orangutans , as well as other threatened species such as sun bears and tigers .
but the most compelling evidence came from rehabilitation centres , which exist to help orangutans and gibbons that have been kept as pets since infancy adapt back to life in the wild .
in the period 2002-2008 , centres were " rescuing " about 20 orangutans unwanted by their owners each year .
in the previous decades , it had been on average about half of that number .
although other factors could explain the difference - a new centre opening , and perhaps new staff keener to take the former pets into their care - it could be that the number of animals being traded has risen , even as wild populations have shrunk .
about half of the animals entered the rehabilitation process when they were under four years of age , well before reaching maturity , indicating that they had been procured as babies - a process that almost always involves killing the mother .
the sumatran orangutan -lrb- pongo abelii -rrb- is more threatened than the other species , which hails from borneo .
in the 1990s , forest supporting about 1,000 of the apes was cleared each year .
the overall population has shrunk by 80 % in 75 years , largely because of deforestation , abetted by the pet trade .
subsequently , civil hostilities in aceh province at the northern end of sumatra curbed the timber trade ; but the 2005 peace accord and the new interest in palm oil are putting fresh pressure on the forests , and so on the orangutans .
last year , the national government and the island 's 10 provincial authorities pledged to halt the loss of forests and native species , and to make development sustainable .
traffic is a joint initiative of the international union for the conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- , which numbers many governments among its members , and the conservation charity wwf .
