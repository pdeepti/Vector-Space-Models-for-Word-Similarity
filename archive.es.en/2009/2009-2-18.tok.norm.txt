during his trip to the us he also plans to visit the un headquarters in new york .
following these meetings , muetzelburg is expected to travel to afghanistan and pakistan next week , to learn for himself about the situation on the ground .
germany has the third largest troop deployment under the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan .
germany to send more soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb attack hit the german embassy in kabul in january in addition to the 3,500 troops stationed in the region , nato diplomats announced on monday that berlin was to send another 600 troops to afghanistan , to provide additional safety ahead of the august presidential elections .
the election in august will be a key test for afghan president harmid karzai , who has become increasingly unpopular in the country due to widespread corruption .
once a darling of the west , karzai has also watched his support weaken there .
his central government is seen as weak and he has been unsuccessful in countering a growing taliban insurgency or curbing opium production .
german defense minister franz josef jung is expected to present berlin 's plans for the deployment during a meeting of nato defense ministers in krakow on thursday .
us leading the way president barack obama announced on tuesday he had signed orders to send the 17,000 additional troops as part of his initial plan to expand the us presence in afghanistan to counter a resurgent taliban , which has used sanctuary regions in pakistan to carry out attacks against coalition and afghan forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muetzelburg is germany 's first special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan the extra troops will be operational by this summer , the top commander of us and nato forces in the country said on wednesday .
but general david mckiernan also told reporters that despite the buildup , the destabilizing and violent situation in afghanistan is unlikely to be quickly reversed .
" i have to tell you that 2009 is going to be a tough year , " mckiernan told reporters at the pentagon , adding that he expects fighting to increase in the summer .
fighting in southern afghanistan , where it has been the heaviest , has produced a stalemate and it remains crucial to get soldiers in unprotected areas , mckiernan said .
" we need additional , persistent security presence in areas that we 're not at today , " mckiernan said .
" and then , in turn , the intent is that that would allow governance and other programs that will enable the population to resist an insurgency in the future . "
the 17,000 troop increase will widen the us presence to more than 50,000 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .

are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .

but not all iraqis agree with all aspects of germany 's policy . the german foreign minister spent wednesday , feb .
18 in the northern iraqi city of arbil before returning to germany .
while there , frank-walter steinmeier officially opened a new german consulate that is intended to symbolize renewed , closer ties between his country and post-war iraq .
" we want to assist in reconstruction , " steinmeier said , adding that his government respected the achievements of the iraqi people and the iraqi government .
against the backdrop of the relatively peaceful , semi-autonomous northern region , with its kurdish majority , steinmeier also said that he anticipated continued improvements in iraq 's security situation .
" i 'm certain that people in iraq will want to leave violence and hatred behind and build a common future for their country , " steinmeier said .
iraqi criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi government has tried to ensure the safety of the country 's christian minority steinmeier 's trip has been hailed as the start of a new chapter in relations between iraq and germany , which refused to participate in the 2003 us-led war that toppled saddam hussein , and which drastically reduced its involvement in the oil-rich , middle east country .
but things were n't all smiles and mutual compliments between steinmeier and his iraqi hosts .
on tuesday a deputy minister in the iraqi government , asghar al moussawi , took germany to task for helping christians leave iraq .
" the fact that certain governments are encouraging the emigration of iraq 's christians is unacceptable , " moussawi was quoted as saying by the centre for national media , an iraqi government organization .
in april 2008 , germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble urged european countries to offer refuge to iraqi christians .
that 's angered some iraqis .
" to encourage a group of any particular faith to leave the country is against international law and causes more harm than benefit to those people , " moussawi was quoted as saying .
it 's estimated that of the 800,000 christians who lived in iraq before the 2003 us-led invasion , around a quarter of a million have fled the country . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .

under exceptional circumstances , civilians can be allowed to stay in europe because there is so much indiscriminate violence in their homeland that they would be in danger if they stayed , the court said .
however , it was up to eu member states to decide when those exceptional circumstances applied , it said .
the eu is currently trying to build a common asylum policy , but is hampered by deep divisions between member states on the questions of who should qualify for protected status and how they should be treated .

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .
the comission expects germany to lose around 500,000 jobs this year as europe 's largest economy struggles with its worst economic recession in decades .
competition over competitiveness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at unemployment has already caused civil unrest in latvia rising unemployment threatens not only to worsen the global economic slowdown , but to pit individual eu member states against one another as national governments try to save jobs for their own constituencies .
for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

and that is by no means the only case that has pitted eu member states against one another in the race to save jobs .
france has drawn heavy criticism from fellow eu members for making its recent state aid package to the french automotive industry contingent on the companies agreeing not to move french jobs elsewhere in the bloc .
that has led a variety of countries including germany and belgium to accuse france of protectionism .

the us auto giant has already announced 47,000 job cuts worldwide . germany said on wednesday gm should come up with a rescue plan for opel even as worries mounted that the german-based carmaker would be a victim of gm 's global restructuring program .
" at the moment , politicians ca n't do anything because the necessary concepts from opel are not available , " german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday .
" and that ca n't happen without the parent company in detroit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has been buffeted by slumping car sales worldwide on tuesday , gm pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 billion -rrb- .
gm subsidiaries in europe are fearful of the potentially fatal cost-cutting and job losses that might imply for their operations .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
the troubled us carmaker said in its new survival plan that it needed about $ 6billion from several governments , including germany , sweden and the uk .
but germany has said gm should come up with a plan for opel if it wanted to get state support .
" the task that now lies ahead of us is a task that opel needs to address , together with its parent company general motors , " merkel said . " they have to present a concept that would ensure a positive outcome for opel . "
fear of job losses in germany in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , concern over job losses was growing quickly .
press reports have said at least one german plant could be among several european factories slated for closure .
a likely candidate is a site in western bochum , which last year lost a nokia mobile telephone plant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at opel 's bochum plant have been shaken by news that gm is cutting 26,000 jobs outside the us opel has been hit badly by problems at its parent company . opel sales last year declined by more than 10 percent .
trade unions and local politicians in germany have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs at the carmaker . many have called for opel to be split from its stricken us parent rather than face being dragged down with it .
gm europe mulling plan to save jobs on wednesday , gm europe directors and the group 's european works committee issued a joint statement saying they had begun talks on a " restructuring process " aimed at seeing how " job cuts and factory closures could be avoided . "
a joint statement said management is " prepared to talk about partnerships with and participations by third parties . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 18.02.2009 europe to lose 3.5 million jobs in 2009 , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more eu citizens will be looking for work , says the commission a new study by the eu commission says that jobless rolls in the european union will swell by a further 3.5 million this year as the global economic slowdown batters labor markets across europe . the eu executive 's new monthly survey , the first of which was published on tuesday , february 17 , indicates that joblessness is becoming an increasingly serious problem for the 27-member bloc .
" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .
the comission expects germany to lose around 500,000 jobs this year as europe 's largest economy struggles with its worst economic recession in decades .
competition over competitiveness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at unemployment has already caused civil unrest in latvia rising unemployment threatens not only to worsen the global economic slowdown , but to pit individual eu member states against one another as national governments try to save jobs for their own constituencies .
for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .
legal battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automotive industry is likely to take a battering the european commission is currently investigating 52.7 million euros -lrb- $ 68 million -rrb- in aid provided by poland to dell .
and that is by no means the only case that has pitted eu member states against one another in the race to save jobs .
france has drawn heavy criticism from fellow eu members for making its recent state aid package to the french automotive industry contingent on the companies agreeing not to move french jobs elsewhere in the bloc .
that has led a variety of countries including germany and belgium to accuse france of protectionism .
to try to address the problem , the eu has called an unofficial summit in brussels on march 1 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 18.02.2009 europe to lose 3.5 million jobs in 2009 , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more eu citizens will be looking for work , says the commission a new study by the eu commission says that jobless rolls in the european union will swell by a further 3.5 million this year as the global economic slowdown batters labor markets across europe . the eu executive 's new monthly survey , the first of which was published on tuesday , february 17 , indicates that joblessness is becoming an increasingly serious problem for the 27-member bloc .
" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .
the comission expects germany to lose around 500,000 jobs this year as europe 's largest economy struggles with its worst economic recession in decades .
competition over competitiveness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at unemployment has already caused civil unrest in latvia rising unemployment threatens not only to worsen the global economic slowdown , but to pit individual eu member states against one another as national governments try to save jobs for their own constituencies .
for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .
legal battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automotive industry is likely to take a battering the european commission is currently investigating 52.7 million euros -lrb- $ 68 million -rrb- in aid provided by poland to dell .
and that is by no means the only case that has pitted eu member states against one another in the race to save jobs .

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .

an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

17 .
the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .
europe wants to coordinate approach the ecj decided that , under eu rules , people seeking the right to live in europe because they fear death at home do not have to prove that they , personally , are under threat of targeted violence , if the country itself is seen as sufficiently dangerous .
under exceptional circumstances , civilians can be allowed to stay in europe because there is so much indiscriminate violence in their homeland that they would be in danger if they stayed , the court said .
however , it was up to eu member states to decide when those exceptional circumstances applied , it said .
the eu is currently trying to build a common asylum policy , but is hampered by deep divisions between member states on the questions of who should qualify for protected status and how they should be treated .
on wednesday , the eu 's executive , the european commission , is set to propose the creation of an eu-wide asylum support office to help member states coordinate their approaches . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the treaty still has plenty of obstacles left before it is approved . after repeated delays , the czech parliament 's lower house narrowly passed the eu reform treaty on wednesday , feb .
18 .
the czech republic is the last member state yet to vote on the accord , which passed parliaments in 25 countries but was rejected by irish voters in a june 2008 referendum .
prime minister mirek topolanek , formerly an opponent of the lisbon treaty , said this week that he had changed his mind and would vote in favor of the pact .
the czech parliament passed the pact 125 to 61 on wednesday , but the vote was closer than it appeared .
a so-called " constitutional majority " of 120 of the 200-seat chamber had to approve the measure .

but even in the czech republic , the treaty still has a ways to go .
it will also need the approval of the country 's senators and president , who may further drag out the ratification process .
czech president vaclav klaus , an opponent of the treaty , said earlier that he would sign it only after ireland overturns its " no " vote .
anti-lisbon senators may also delay the ratification process as they mull putting the treaty under a court review .
the czech reluctance has been a point of contention since the country 's government currently chairs the 27-member bloc .
the ratification process has not been completed in germany and poland , whose presidents are yet to ink the pact .

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .
the german automotive industry may be likely to bounce back at some point , but for most companies at present , concrete signs of a recovery are difficult to see . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during his trip to the us he also plans to visit the un headquarters in new york .
following these meetings , muetzelburg is expected to travel to afghanistan and pakistan next week , to learn for himself about the situation on the ground .
germany has the third largest troop deployment under the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan .
germany to send more soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb attack hit the german embassy in kabul in january in addition to the 3,500 troops stationed in the region , nato diplomats announced on monday that berlin was to send another 600 troops to afghanistan , to provide additional safety ahead of the august presidential elections .
the election in august will be a key test for afghan president harmid karzai , who has become increasingly unpopular in the country due to widespread corruption .
once a darling of the west , karzai has also watched his support weaken there .
his central government is seen as weak and he has been unsuccessful in countering a growing taliban insurgency or curbing opium production .
german defense minister franz josef jung is expected to present berlin 's plans for the deployment during a meeting of nato defense ministers in krakow on thursday .
us leading the way president barack obama announced on tuesday he had signed orders to send the 17,000 additional troops as part of his initial plan to expand the us presence in afghanistan to counter a resurgent taliban , which has used sanctuary regions in pakistan to carry out attacks against coalition and afghan forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muetzelburg is germany 's first special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan the extra troops will be operational by this summer , the top commander of us and nato forces in the country said on wednesday .
but general david mckiernan also told reporters that despite the buildup , the destabilizing and violent situation in afghanistan is unlikely to be quickly reversed .
" i have to tell you that 2009 is going to be a tough year , " mckiernan told reporters at the pentagon , adding that he expects fighting to increase in the summer .
fighting in southern afghanistan , where it has been the heaviest , has produced a stalemate and it remains crucial to get soldiers in unprotected areas , mckiernan said .
" we need additional , persistent security presence in areas that we 're not at today , " mckiernan said .
" and then , in turn , the intent is that that would allow governance and other programs that will enable the population to resist an insurgency in the future . "
the 17,000 troop increase will widen the us presence to more than 50,000 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us auto giant has already announced 47,000 job cuts worldwide . germany said on wednesday gm should come up with a rescue plan for opel even as worries mounted that the german-based carmaker would be a victim of gm 's global restructuring program .

" and that ca n't happen without the parent company in detroit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has been buffeted by slumping car sales worldwide on tuesday , gm pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 billion -rrb- .
gm subsidiaries in europe are fearful of the potentially fatal cost-cutting and job losses that might imply for their operations .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
the troubled us carmaker said in its new survival plan that it needed about $ 6billion from several governments , including germany , sweden and the uk .
but germany has said gm should come up with a plan for opel if it wanted to get state support .
" the task that now lies ahead of us is a task that opel needs to address , together with its parent company general motors , " merkel said . " they have to present a concept that would ensure a positive outcome for opel . "
fear of job losses in germany in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , concern over job losses was growing quickly .

gm europe mulling plan to save jobs on wednesday , gm europe directors and the group 's european works committee issued a joint statement saying they had begun talks on a " restructuring process " aimed at seeing how " job cuts and factory closures could be avoided . "

prime minister mirek topolanek , formerly an opponent of the lisbon treaty , said this week that he had changed his mind and would vote in favor of the pact .
the czech parliament passed the pact 125 to 61 on wednesday , but the vote was closer than it appeared .

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .

an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

17 .
the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .
europe wants to coordinate approach the ecj decided that , under eu rules , people seeking the right to live in europe because they fear death at home do not have to prove that they , personally , are under threat of targeted violence , if the country itself is seen as sufficiently dangerous .
under exceptional circumstances , civilians can be allowed to stay in europe because there is so much indiscriminate violence in their homeland that they would be in danger if they stayed , the court said .
however , it was up to eu member states to decide when those exceptional circumstances applied , it said .
the eu is currently trying to build a common asylum policy , but is hampered by deep divisions between member states on the questions of who should qualify for protected status and how they should be treated .

17 , by his aides , mueller demanded retractions and a personal apology by each to the pontiff . mueller said the petition implied that reconciling with the ultra-traditionalist group , the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- meant the pope had permitted catholics to challenge modern church teachings . " this in not true , " he wrote .
" you have shown yourself that you are not qualified to teach catholic theology . "
the letter threatened " further steps " but did not say if this meant revoking their licenses to teach in the name of the church at the public university . professors shocked by threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson said he wants to evaluate the evidence of the holocaust the initial controversy was triggered by the decision last month of pope benedict xvi to end an internal catholic schism with the sspx .

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .
the comission expects germany to lose around 500,000 jobs this year as europe 's largest economy struggles with its worst economic recession in decades .

for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

the us auto giant has already announced 47,000 job cuts worldwide . germany said on wednesday gm should come up with a rescue plan for opel even as worries mounted that the german-based carmaker would be a victim of gm 's global restructuring program .
" at the moment , politicians ca n't do anything because the necessary concepts from opel are not available , " german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday .
" and that ca n't happen without the parent company in detroit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has been buffeted by slumping car sales worldwide on tuesday , gm pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 billion -rrb- .
gm subsidiaries in europe are fearful of the potentially fatal cost-cutting and job losses that might imply for their operations .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
the troubled us carmaker said in its new survival plan that it needed about $ 6billion from several governments , including germany , sweden and the uk .
but germany has said gm should come up with a plan for opel if it wanted to get state support .
" the task that now lies ahead of us is a task that opel needs to address , together with its parent company general motors , " merkel said . " they have to present a concept that would ensure a positive outcome for opel . "
fear of job losses in germany in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , concern over job losses was growing quickly .
press reports have said at least one german plant could be among several european factories slated for closure .

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .
the comission expects germany to lose around 500,000 jobs this year as europe 's largest economy struggles with its worst economic recession in decades .
competition over competitiveness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at unemployment has already caused civil unrest in latvia rising unemployment threatens not only to worsen the global economic slowdown , but to pit individual eu member states against one another as national governments try to save jobs for their own constituencies .
for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

and that is by no means the only case that has pitted eu member states against one another in the race to save jobs .
france has drawn heavy criticism from fellow eu members for making its recent state aid package to the french automotive industry contingent on the companies agreeing not to move french jobs elsewhere in the bloc .
that has led a variety of countries including germany and belgium to accuse france of protectionism .
to try to address the problem , the eu has called an unofficial summit in brussels on march 1 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .
europe wants to coordinate approach the ecj decided that , under eu rules , people seeking the right to live in europe because they fear death at home do not have to prove that they , personally , are under threat of targeted violence , if the country itself is seen as sufficiently dangerous .
under exceptional circumstances , civilians can be allowed to stay in europe because there is so much indiscriminate violence in their homeland that they would be in danger if they stayed , the court said .
however , it was up to eu member states to decide when those exceptional circumstances applied , it said .

the czech republic is the last member state yet to vote on the accord , which passed parliaments in 25 countries but was rejected by irish voters in a june 2008 referendum .
prime minister mirek topolanek , formerly an opponent of the lisbon treaty , said this week that he had changed his mind and would vote in favor of the pact .
the czech parliament passed the pact 125 to 61 on wednesday , but the vote was closer than it appeared .

it will also need the approval of the country 's senators and president , who may further drag out the ratification process .
czech president vaclav klaus , an opponent of the treaty , said earlier that he would sign it only after ireland overturns its " no " vote .
anti-lisbon senators may also delay the ratification process as they mull putting the treaty under a court review .
the czech reluctance has been a point of contention since the country 's government currently chairs the 27-member bloc .
the ratification process has not been completed in germany and poland , whose presidents are yet to ink the pact .

17 .
the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .
europe wants to coordinate approach the ecj decided that , under eu rules , people seeking the right to live in europe because they fear death at home do not have to prove that they , personally , are under threat of targeted violence , if the country itself is seen as sufficiently dangerous .
under exceptional circumstances , civilians can be allowed to stay in europe because there is so much indiscriminate violence in their homeland that they would be in danger if they stayed , the court said .
however , it was up to eu member states to decide when those exceptional circumstances applied , it said .
the eu is currently trying to build a common asylum policy , but is hampered by deep divisions between member states on the questions of who should qualify for protected status and how they should be treated .
on wednesday , the eu 's executive , the european commission , is set to propose the creation of an eu-wide asylum support office to help member states coordinate their approaches . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 .
the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .
europe wants to coordinate approach the ecj decided that , under eu rules , people seeking the right to live in europe because they fear death at home do not have to prove that they , personally , are under threat of targeted violence , if the country itself is seen as sufficiently dangerous .
under exceptional circumstances , civilians can be allowed to stay in europe because there is so much indiscriminate violence in their homeland that they would be in danger if they stayed , the court said .
however , it was up to eu member states to decide when those exceptional circumstances applied , it said .
the eu is currently trying to build a common asylum policy , but is hampered by deep divisions between member states on the questions of who should qualify for protected status and how they should be treated .

are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .

are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .

but the treaty still has plenty of obstacles left before it is approved . after repeated delays , the czech parliament 's lower house narrowly passed the eu reform treaty on wednesday , feb .

the czech republic is the last member state yet to vote on the accord , which passed parliaments in 25 countries but was rejected by irish voters in a june 2008 referendum .
prime minister mirek topolanek , formerly an opponent of the lisbon treaty , said this week that he had changed his mind and would vote in favor of the pact .
the czech parliament passed the pact 125 to 61 on wednesday , but the vote was closer than it appeared .
a so-called " constitutional majority " of 120 of the 200-seat chamber had to approve the measure .
germany , poland also still have to sign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is awaiting a court ruling on the treaty if adopted by all member states , the treaty would overhaul eu institutions with the aim to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc .
but even in the czech republic , the treaty still has a ways to go .
it will also need the approval of the country 's senators and president , who may further drag out the ratification process .
czech president vaclav klaus , an opponent of the treaty , said earlier that he would sign it only after ireland overturns its " no " vote .
anti-lisbon senators may also delay the ratification process as they mull putting the treaty under a court review .
the czech reluctance has been a point of contention since the country 's government currently chairs the 27-member bloc .
the ratification process has not been completed in germany and poland , whose presidents are yet to ink the pact .
germany 's highest court also recently heard arguments that the treaty would undermine the power of the country 's legislative body . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 .
the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .
europe wants to coordinate approach the ecj decided that , under eu rules , people seeking the right to live in europe because they fear death at home do not have to prove that they , personally , are under threat of targeted violence , if the country itself is seen as sufficiently dangerous .
under exceptional circumstances , civilians can be allowed to stay in europe because there is so much indiscriminate violence in their homeland that they would be in danger if they stayed , the court said .
however , it was up to eu member states to decide when those exceptional circumstances applied , it said .
the eu is currently trying to build a common asylum policy , but is hampered by deep divisions between member states on the questions of who should qualify for protected status and how they should be treated .
on wednesday , the eu 's executive , the european commission , is set to propose the creation of an eu-wide asylum support office to help member states coordinate their approaches . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 in a bid to shore up the financial system by partially nationalizing especially troubled banks and , as a last resort , expropriating obstructionist shareholders . " there are other options , " merkel said .
" only if they fail will the ultima ratio come into play , the last resort of a disappropriation . " the draft bill is clearly tailored to address the problems created by ailing munich-based lender hypo real estate , or hre , a high-profile casualty of the financial crisis . the mortgage lender has already received 87 billion euros in state guarantees over the past year but has failed to recover .
and the german government has not received a single share of hre stock despite its investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet agreed the draft law on wednesday the government plans to draw up an " emergency takeover rescue law , " perhaps including fresh capital injections , for hre by april 3 .
it would then be presented to a general meeting of bank investors for approval .
only if that failed , would the disappropriation option be exercised . us private equity firm jc flowers owns a 25-percent stake of hre .
the german government has been trying to negotiate a buy-out for the past week - thus far without result . flowers purchased the stock last year for 22.50 euros a share , but share prices have since fallen to just over 1.50 euros . the specter of socialism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft law puts merkel at odds with business leaders like hundt other countries , including britain and ireland , have already taken control of stricken banks , justifying an expropriation of shareholders by pointing to the extraordinary nature of the global economic slowdown and the need to protect taxpayers . but a similar move is germany is all the more controversial because of germany 's nazi and communist pasts , when the state wantonly confiscated citizens ' property and assets . merkel has tried to portray the legislation as being fully in keeping with the german tradition of the " social market economy " - a free-market system steered by the government for the citizenry 's collective benefit . but some in the political opposition reject those characterizations . " expropriation is socialism , not social market economy , " the head of the opposition pro-business free democrats , guido westerwelle , told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but supporters say nationalization is needed to stop the downward spiral and germany business leaders are n't impressed either . " i am horrified that the government wants to open up a possibility for nationalizing a bank and disappropriating investors , " the president of the german employers ' federation , dieter hundt , said in an official statement . but the idea has gone down well with those on the political left in germany . " this sort of intelligent partial nationalization of banks is something we called for last year as part of the umbrella package to rescure the financial markets , " green party parliamentary leader fritz kuhn said in a statement . nonetheless , should merkel 's government decide that the last resort of expropriation is indeed their only option , the result would surely be a lawsuit in front of germany 's constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- jc / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2009 free-market fdp gains on bigger german political parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2009 could be a banner year for the free democrats the most recent public opinion poll puts the opposition business-friendly free democrats , or fdp , only four points behind the social democrats .
are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .
in the end , the party 's leading candidate only received 6.1 percent of the vote . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .

an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

but the treaty still has plenty of obstacles left before it is approved . after repeated delays , the czech parliament 's lower house narrowly passed the eu reform treaty on wednesday , feb .

the czech republic is the last member state yet to vote on the accord , which passed parliaments in 25 countries but was rejected by irish voters in a june 2008 referendum .
prime minister mirek topolanek , formerly an opponent of the lisbon treaty , said this week that he had changed his mind and would vote in favor of the pact .
the czech parliament passed the pact 125 to 61 on wednesday , but the vote was closer than it appeared .
a so-called " constitutional majority " of 120 of the 200-seat chamber had to approve the measure .
germany , poland also still have to sign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is awaiting a court ruling on the treaty if adopted by all member states , the treaty would overhaul eu institutions with the aim to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc .
but even in the czech republic , the treaty still has a ways to go .
it will also need the approval of the country 's senators and president , who may further drag out the ratification process .
czech president vaclav klaus , an opponent of the treaty , said earlier that he would sign it only after ireland overturns its " no " vote .
anti-lisbon senators may also delay the ratification process as they mull putting the treaty under a court review .
the czech reluctance has been a point of contention since the country 's government currently chairs the 27-member bloc .
the ratification process has not been completed in germany and poland , whose presidents are yet to ink the pact .
germany 's highest court also recently heard arguments that the treaty would undermine the power of the country 's legislative body . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all iraqis agree with all aspects of germany 's policy . the german foreign minister spent wednesday , feb .
18 in the northern iraqi city of arbil before returning to germany .
while there , frank-walter steinmeier officially opened a new german consulate that is intended to symbolize renewed , closer ties between his country and post-war iraq .
" we want to assist in reconstruction , " steinmeier said , adding that his government respected the achievements of the iraqi people and the iraqi government .
against the backdrop of the relatively peaceful , semi-autonomous northern region , with its kurdish majority , steinmeier also said that he anticipated continued improvements in iraq 's security situation .
" i 'm certain that people in iraq will want to leave violence and hatred behind and build a common future for their country , " steinmeier said .
iraqi criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi government has tried to ensure the safety of the country 's christian minority steinmeier 's trip has been hailed as the start of a new chapter in relations between iraq and germany , which refused to participate in the 2003 us-led war that toppled saddam hussein , and which drastically reduced its involvement in the oil-rich , middle east country .
but things were n't all smiles and mutual compliments between steinmeier and his iraqi hosts .
on tuesday a deputy minister in the iraqi government , asghar al moussawi , took germany to task for helping christians leave iraq .
" the fact that certain governments are encouraging the emigration of iraq 's christians is unacceptable , " moussawi was quoted as saying by the centre for national media , an iraqi government organization .
in april 2008 , germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble urged european countries to offer refuge to iraqi christians .
that 's angered some iraqis .
" to encourage a group of any particular faith to leave the country is against international law and causes more harm than benefit to those people , " moussawi was quoted as saying .
it 's estimated that of the 800,000 christians who lived in iraq before the 2003 us-led invasion , around a quarter of a million have fled the country . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .
the comission expects germany to lose around 500,000 jobs this year as europe 's largest economy struggles with its worst economic recession in decades .

for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

france has drawn heavy criticism from fellow eu members for making its recent state aid package to the french automotive industry contingent on the companies agreeing not to move french jobs elsewhere in the bloc .

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .

an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

but not all iraqis agree with all aspects of germany 's policy . the german foreign minister spent wednesday , feb .
18 in the northern iraqi city of arbil before returning to germany .
while there , frank-walter steinmeier officially opened a new german consulate that is intended to symbolize renewed , closer ties between his country and post-war iraq .
" we want to assist in reconstruction , " steinmeier said , adding that his government respected the achievements of the iraqi people and the iraqi government .
against the backdrop of the relatively peaceful , semi-autonomous northern region , with its kurdish majority , steinmeier also said that he anticipated continued improvements in iraq 's security situation .
" i 'm certain that people in iraq will want to leave violence and hatred behind and build a common future for their country , " steinmeier said .
iraqi criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi government has tried to ensure the safety of the country 's christian minority steinmeier 's trip has been hailed as the start of a new chapter in relations between iraq and germany , which refused to participate in the 2003 us-led war that toppled saddam hussein , and which drastically reduced its involvement in the oil-rich , middle east country .
but things were n't all smiles and mutual compliments between steinmeier and his iraqi hosts .
on tuesday a deputy minister in the iraqi government , asghar al moussawi , took germany to task for helping christians leave iraq .
" the fact that certain governments are encouraging the emigration of iraq 's christians is unacceptable , " moussawi was quoted as saying by the centre for national media , an iraqi government organization .
in april 2008 , germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble urged european countries to offer refuge to iraqi christians .
that 's angered some iraqis .
" to encourage a group of any particular faith to leave the country is against international law and causes more harm than benefit to those people , " moussawi was quoted as saying .
it 's estimated that of the 800,000 christians who lived in iraq before the 2003 us-led invasion , around a quarter of a million have fled the country . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czech president vaclav klaus , an opponent of the treaty , said earlier that he would sign it only after ireland overturns its " no " vote .
anti-lisbon senators may also delay the ratification process as they mull putting the treaty under a court review .
the czech reluctance has been a point of contention since the country 's government currently chairs the 27-member bloc .

the us auto giant has already announced 47,000 job cuts worldwide . germany said on wednesday gm should come up with a rescue plan for opel even as worries mounted that the german-based carmaker would be a victim of gm 's global restructuring program .
" at the moment , politicians ca n't do anything because the necessary concepts from opel are not available , " german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday .
" and that ca n't happen without the parent company in detroit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has been buffeted by slumping car sales worldwide on tuesday , gm pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 billion -rrb- .
gm subsidiaries in europe are fearful of the potentially fatal cost-cutting and job losses that might imply for their operations .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
the troubled us carmaker said in its new survival plan that it needed about $ 6billion from several governments , including germany , sweden and the uk .
but germany has said gm should come up with a plan for opel if it wanted to get state support .
" the task that now lies ahead of us is a task that opel needs to address , together with its parent company general motors , " merkel said . " they have to present a concept that would ensure a positive outcome for opel . "
fear of job losses in germany in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , concern over job losses was growing quickly .
press reports have said at least one german plant could be among several european factories slated for closure .
a likely candidate is a site in western bochum , which last year lost a nokia mobile telephone plant .

trade unions and local politicians in germany have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs at the carmaker . many have called for opel to be split from its stricken us parent rather than face being dragged down with it .
gm europe mulling plan to save jobs on wednesday , gm europe directors and the group 's european works committee issued a joint statement saying they had begun talks on a " restructuring process " aimed at seeing how " job cuts and factory closures could be avoided . "

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .

ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2009 free-market fdp gains on bigger german political parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2009 could be a banner year for the free democrats the most recent public opinion poll puts the opposition business-friendly free democrats , or fdp , only four points behind the social democrats .
are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .
in the end , the party 's leading candidate only received 6.1 percent of the vote . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .

the us auto giant has already announced 47,000 job cuts worldwide . germany said on wednesday gm should come up with a rescue plan for opel even as worries mounted that the german-based carmaker would be a victim of gm 's global restructuring program .
" at the moment , politicians ca n't do anything because the necessary concepts from opel are not available , " german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday .
" and that ca n't happen without the parent company in detroit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has been buffeted by slumping car sales worldwide on tuesday , gm pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 billion -rrb- .
gm subsidiaries in europe are fearful of the potentially fatal cost-cutting and job losses that might imply for their operations .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
the troubled us carmaker said in its new survival plan that it needed about $ 6billion from several governments , including germany , sweden and the uk .
but germany has said gm should come up with a plan for opel if it wanted to get state support .
" the task that now lies ahead of us is a task that opel needs to address , together with its parent company general motors , " merkel said . " they have to present a concept that would ensure a positive outcome for opel . "
fear of job losses in germany in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , concern over job losses was growing quickly .
press reports have said at least one german plant could be among several european factories slated for closure .
a likely candidate is a site in western bochum , which last year lost a nokia mobile telephone plant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at opel 's bochum plant have been shaken by news that gm is cutting 26,000 jobs outside the us opel has been hit badly by problems at its parent company . opel sales last year declined by more than 10 percent .
trade unions and local politicians in germany have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs at the carmaker . many have called for opel to be split from its stricken us parent rather than face being dragged down with it .
gm europe mulling plan to save jobs on wednesday , gm europe directors and the group 's european works committee issued a joint statement saying they had begun talks on a " restructuring process " aimed at seeing how " job cuts and factory closures could be avoided . "
a joint statement said management is " prepared to talk about partnerships with and participations by third parties . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , by his aides , mueller demanded retractions and a personal apology by each to the pontiff . mueller said the petition implied that reconciling with the ultra-traditionalist group , the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- meant the pope had permitted catholics to challenge modern church teachings . " this in not true , " he wrote .
" you have shown yourself that you are not qualified to teach catholic theology . "
the letter threatened " further steps " but did not say if this meant revoking their licenses to teach in the name of the church at the public university . professors shocked by threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson said he wants to evaluate the evidence of the holocaust the initial controversy was triggered by the decision last month of pope benedict xvi to end an internal catholic schism with the sspx .
the society includes british-born bishop richard williamson , who has denied the scale of the holocaust . liberal catholics in germany and austria have accused the pope , who is german , of mismanaging the subsequent political and inter-faith crisis . sabine demel , professor of canon law at the university , said she was appalled at the letter from mueller .
professor burkard porzelt , a religious-education scholar , said he was shocked " that there was no discussion beforehand . " the other professor , heinz-guenther schoettler , who teaches pastoral theology , could not be contacted . mueller is an upholder of the authority of the pope and bishops . he is also hostile to the sspx . williamson 's remarks denying there were any nazi gas chambers were made in regensburg diocese in november .
williamson believes only 200,000 to 300,000 jews were killed by the nazis , rather than the 6 million accepted by historians . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 .
the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .
europe wants to coordinate approach the ecj decided that , under eu rules , people seeking the right to live in europe because they fear death at home do not have to prove that they , personally , are under threat of targeted violence , if the country itself is seen as sufficiently dangerous .
under exceptional circumstances , civilians can be allowed to stay in europe because there is so much indiscriminate violence in their homeland that they would be in danger if they stayed , the court said .
however , it was up to eu member states to decide when those exceptional circumstances applied , it said .
the eu is currently trying to build a common asylum policy , but is hampered by deep divisions between member states on the questions of who should qualify for protected status and how they should be treated .
on wednesday , the eu 's executive , the european commission , is set to propose the creation of an eu-wide asylum support office to help member states coordinate their approaches . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .
the german automotive industry may be likely to bounce back at some point , but for most companies at present , concrete signs of a recovery are difficult to see . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2009 free-market fdp gains on bigger german political parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2009 could be a banner year for the free democrats the most recent public opinion poll puts the opposition business-friendly free democrats , or fdp , only four points behind the social democrats .
are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .
in the end , the party 's leading candidate only received 6.1 percent of the vote . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during his trip to the us he also plans to visit the un headquarters in new york .
following these meetings , muetzelburg is expected to travel to afghanistan and pakistan next week , to learn for himself about the situation on the ground .
germany has the third largest troop deployment under the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan .
germany to send more soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb attack hit the german embassy in kabul in january in addition to the 3,500 troops stationed in the region , nato diplomats announced on monday that berlin was to send another 600 troops to afghanistan , to provide additional safety ahead of the august presidential elections .
the election in august will be a key test for afghan president harmid karzai , who has become increasingly unpopular in the country due to widespread corruption .
once a darling of the west , karzai has also watched his support weaken there .
his central government is seen as weak and he has been unsuccessful in countering a growing taliban insurgency or curbing opium production .
german defense minister franz josef jung is expected to present berlin 's plans for the deployment during a meeting of nato defense ministers in krakow on thursday .
us leading the way president barack obama announced on tuesday he had signed orders to send the 17,000 additional troops as part of his initial plan to expand the us presence in afghanistan to counter a resurgent taliban , which has used sanctuary regions in pakistan to carry out attacks against coalition and afghan forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muetzelburg is germany 's first special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan the extra troops will be operational by this summer , the top commander of us and nato forces in the country said on wednesday .
but general david mckiernan also told reporters that despite the buildup , the destabilizing and violent situation in afghanistan is unlikely to be quickly reversed .
" i have to tell you that 2009 is going to be a tough year , " mckiernan told reporters at the pentagon , adding that he expects fighting to increase in the summer .
fighting in southern afghanistan , where it has been the heaviest , has produced a stalemate and it remains crucial to get soldiers in unprotected areas , mckiernan said .
" we need additional , persistent security presence in areas that we 're not at today , " mckiernan said .
" and then , in turn , the intent is that that would allow governance and other programs that will enable the population to resist an insurgency in the future . "
the 17,000 troop increase will widen the us presence to more than 50,000 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all iraqis agree with all aspects of germany 's policy . the german foreign minister spent wednesday , feb .
18 in the northern iraqi city of arbil before returning to germany .
while there , frank-walter steinmeier officially opened a new german consulate that is intended to symbolize renewed , closer ties between his country and post-war iraq .
" we want to assist in reconstruction , " steinmeier said , adding that his government respected the achievements of the iraqi people and the iraqi government .
against the backdrop of the relatively peaceful , semi-autonomous northern region , with its kurdish majority , steinmeier also said that he anticipated continued improvements in iraq 's security situation .
" i 'm certain that people in iraq will want to leave violence and hatred behind and build a common future for their country , " steinmeier said .
iraqi criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi government has tried to ensure the safety of the country 's christian minority steinmeier 's trip has been hailed as the start of a new chapter in relations between iraq and germany , which refused to participate in the 2003 us-led war that toppled saddam hussein , and which drastically reduced its involvement in the oil-rich , middle east country .
but things were n't all smiles and mutual compliments between steinmeier and his iraqi hosts .
on tuesday a deputy minister in the iraqi government , asghar al moussawi , took germany to task for helping christians leave iraq .
" the fact that certain governments are encouraging the emigration of iraq 's christians is unacceptable , " moussawi was quoted as saying by the centre for national media , an iraqi government organization .
in april 2008 , germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble urged european countries to offer refuge to iraqi christians .
that 's angered some iraqis .
" to encourage a group of any particular faith to leave the country is against international law and causes more harm than benefit to those people , " moussawi was quoted as saying .
it 's estimated that of the 800,000 christians who lived in iraq before the 2003 us-led invasion , around a quarter of a million have fled the country . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .

and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .
the german automotive industry may be likely to bounce back at some point , but for most companies at present , concrete signs of a recovery are difficult to see . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during his trip to the us he also plans to visit the un headquarters in new york .
following these meetings , muetzelburg is expected to travel to afghanistan and pakistan next week , to learn for himself about the situation on the ground .
germany has the third largest troop deployment under the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan .
germany to send more soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb attack hit the german embassy in kabul in january in addition to the 3,500 troops stationed in the region , nato diplomats announced on monday that berlin was to send another 600 troops to afghanistan , to provide additional safety ahead of the august presidential elections .
the election in august will be a key test for afghan president harmid karzai , who has become increasingly unpopular in the country due to widespread corruption .
once a darling of the west , karzai has also watched his support weaken there .
his central government is seen as weak and he has been unsuccessful in countering a growing taliban insurgency or curbing opium production .
german defense minister franz josef jung is expected to present berlin 's plans for the deployment during a meeting of nato defense ministers in krakow on thursday .
us leading the way president barack obama announced on tuesday he had signed orders to send the 17,000 additional troops as part of his initial plan to expand the us presence in afghanistan to counter a resurgent taliban , which has used sanctuary regions in pakistan to carry out attacks against coalition and afghan forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muetzelburg is germany 's first special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan the extra troops will be operational by this summer , the top commander of us and nato forces in the country said on wednesday .
but general david mckiernan also told reporters that despite the buildup , the destabilizing and violent situation in afghanistan is unlikely to be quickly reversed .
" i have to tell you that 2009 is going to be a tough year , " mckiernan told reporters at the pentagon , adding that he expects fighting to increase in the summer .
fighting in southern afghanistan , where it has been the heaviest , has produced a stalemate and it remains crucial to get soldiers in unprotected areas , mckiernan said .
" we need additional , persistent security presence in areas that we 're not at today , " mckiernan said .
" and then , in turn , the intent is that that would allow governance and other programs that will enable the population to resist an insurgency in the future . "

are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2009 free-market fdp gains on bigger german political parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2009 could be a banner year for the free democrats the most recent public opinion poll puts the opposition business-friendly free democrats , or fdp , only four points behind the social democrats .
are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .
the german automotive industry may be likely to bounce back at some point , but for most companies at present , concrete signs of a recovery are difficult to see . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 18.02.2009 german foreign minister visits northern iraq amidst criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's visit has raised germany 's profile in iraq germany 's highest ranking diplomat , frank-walter steinmeier , has wrapped up his two-day trip to iraq with a visit to the kurdish north of the country .
but not all iraqis agree with all aspects of germany 's policy . the german foreign minister spent wednesday , feb .
18 in the northern iraqi city of arbil before returning to germany .
while there , frank-walter steinmeier officially opened a new german consulate that is intended to symbolize renewed , closer ties between his country and post-war iraq .
" we want to assist in reconstruction , " steinmeier said , adding that his government respected the achievements of the iraqi people and the iraqi government .
against the backdrop of the relatively peaceful , semi-autonomous northern region , with its kurdish majority , steinmeier also said that he anticipated continued improvements in iraq 's security situation .
" i 'm certain that people in iraq will want to leave violence and hatred behind and build a common future for their country , " steinmeier said .
iraqi criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi government has tried to ensure the safety of the country 's christian minority steinmeier 's trip has been hailed as the start of a new chapter in relations between iraq and germany , which refused to participate in the 2003 us-led war that toppled saddam hussein , and which drastically reduced its involvement in the oil-rich , middle east country .
but things were n't all smiles and mutual compliments between steinmeier and his iraqi hosts .
on tuesday a deputy minister in the iraqi government , asghar al moussawi , took germany to task for helping christians leave iraq .
" the fact that certain governments are encouraging the emigration of iraq 's christians is unacceptable , " moussawi was quoted as saying by the centre for national media , an iraqi government organization .
in april 2008 , germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble urged european countries to offer refuge to iraqi christians .

during his trip to the us he also plans to visit the un headquarters in new york .

germany has the third largest troop deployment under the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan .
germany to send more soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb attack hit the german embassy in kabul in january in addition to the 3,500 troops stationed in the region , nato diplomats announced on monday that berlin was to send another 600 troops to afghanistan , to provide additional safety ahead of the august presidential elections .
the election in august will be a key test for afghan president harmid karzai , who has become increasingly unpopular in the country due to widespread corruption .
once a darling of the west , karzai has also watched his support weaken there .
his central government is seen as weak and he has been unsuccessful in countering a growing taliban insurgency or curbing opium production .

us leading the way president barack obama announced on tuesday he had signed orders to send the 17,000 additional troops as part of his initial plan to expand the us presence in afghanistan to counter a resurgent taliban , which has used sanctuary regions in pakistan to carry out attacks against coalition and afghan forces .

are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .

at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .

voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.02.2009 german car industry struggles with question of part-time labor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ford 's compact models are doing relatively well amidst the gloom of gm and chrysler announcing mass lay-offs , there was rare good news from ford germany .
the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .
the german automotive industry may be likely to bounce back at some point , but for most companies at present , concrete signs of a recovery are difficult to see . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 18.02.2009 europe to lose 3.5 million jobs in 2009 , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more eu citizens will be looking for work , says the commission a new study by the eu commission says that jobless rolls in the european union will swell by a further 3.5 million this year as the global economic slowdown batters labor markets across europe . the eu executive 's new monthly survey , the first of which was published on tuesday , february 17 , indicates that joblessness is becoming an increasingly serious problem for the 27-member bloc .
" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .
the comission expects germany to lose around 500,000 jobs this year as europe 's largest economy struggles with its worst economic recession in decades .
competition over competitiveness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at unemployment has already caused civil unrest in latvia rising unemployment threatens not only to worsen the global economic slowdown , but to pit individual eu member states against one another as national governments try to save jobs for their own constituencies .
for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .
legal battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automotive industry is likely to take a battering the european commission is currently investigating 52.7 million euros -lrb- $ 68 million -rrb- in aid provided by poland to dell .
and that is by no means the only case that has pitted eu member states against one another in the race to save jobs .
france has drawn heavy criticism from fellow eu members for making its recent state aid package to the french automotive industry contingent on the companies agreeing not to move french jobs elsewhere in the bloc .
that has led a variety of countries including germany and belgium to accuse france of protectionism .
to try to address the problem , the eu has called an unofficial summit in brussels on march 1 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2009 free-market fdp gains on bigger german political parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2009 could be a banner year for the free democrats the most recent public opinion poll puts the opposition business-friendly free democrats , or fdp , only four points behind the social democrats .
are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .
in the end , the party 's leading candidate only received 6.1 percent of the vote . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .
the comission expects germany to lose around 500,000 jobs this year as europe 's largest economy struggles with its worst economic recession in decades .
competition over competitiveness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at unemployment has already caused civil unrest in latvia rising unemployment threatens not only to worsen the global economic slowdown , but to pit individual eu member states against one another as national governments try to save jobs for their own constituencies .
for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

and that is by no means the only case that has pitted eu member states against one another in the race to save jobs .
france has drawn heavy criticism from fellow eu members for making its recent state aid package to the french automotive industry contingent on the companies agreeing not to move french jobs elsewhere in the bloc .
that has led a variety of countries including germany and belgium to accuse france of protectionism .

the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .
europe wants to coordinate approach the ecj decided that , under eu rules , people seeking the right to live in europe because they fear death at home do not have to prove that they , personally , are under threat of targeted violence , if the country itself is seen as sufficiently dangerous .
under exceptional circumstances , civilians can be allowed to stay in europe because there is so much indiscriminate violence in their homeland that they would be in danger if they stayed , the court said .
however , it was up to eu member states to decide when those exceptional circumstances applied , it said .
the eu is currently trying to build a common asylum policy , but is hampered by deep divisions between member states on the questions of who should qualify for protected status and how they should be treated .

the us auto giant has already announced 47,000 job cuts worldwide . germany said on wednesday gm should come up with a rescue plan for opel even as worries mounted that the german-based carmaker would be a victim of gm 's global restructuring program .
" at the moment , politicians ca n't do anything because the necessary concepts from opel are not available , " german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday .
" and that ca n't happen without the parent company in detroit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has been buffeted by slumping car sales worldwide on tuesday , gm pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 billion -rrb- .
gm subsidiaries in europe are fearful of the potentially fatal cost-cutting and job losses that might imply for their operations .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
the troubled us carmaker said in its new survival plan that it needed about $ 6billion from several governments , including germany , sweden and the uk .
but germany has said gm should come up with a plan for opel if it wanted to get state support .
" the task that now lies ahead of us is a task that opel needs to address , together with its parent company general motors , " merkel said . " they have to present a concept that would ensure a positive outcome for opel . "
fear of job losses in germany in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , concern over job losses was growing quickly .
press reports have said at least one german plant could be among several european factories slated for closure .
a likely candidate is a site in western bochum , which last year lost a nokia mobile telephone plant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at opel 's bochum plant have been shaken by news that gm is cutting 26,000 jobs outside the us opel has been hit badly by problems at its parent company . opel sales last year declined by more than 10 percent .
trade unions and local politicians in germany have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs at the carmaker . many have called for opel to be split from its stricken us parent rather than face being dragged down with it .
gm europe mulling plan to save jobs on wednesday , gm europe directors and the group 's european works committee issued a joint statement saying they had begun talks on a " restructuring process " aimed at seeing how " job cuts and factory closures could be avoided . "
a joint statement said management is " prepared to talk about partnerships with and participations by third parties . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 .
the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 18.02.2009 europe to lose 3.5 million jobs in 2009 , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more eu citizens will be looking for work , says the commission a new study by the eu commission says that jobless rolls in the european union will swell by a further 3.5 million this year as the global economic slowdown batters labor markets across europe . the eu executive 's new monthly survey , the first of which was published on tuesday , february 17 , indicates that joblessness is becoming an increasingly serious problem for the 27-member bloc .
" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .
the comission expects germany to lose around 500,000 jobs this year as europe 's largest economy struggles with its worst economic recession in decades .
competition over competitiveness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at unemployment has already caused civil unrest in latvia rising unemployment threatens not only to worsen the global economic slowdown , but to pit individual eu member states against one another as national governments try to save jobs for their own constituencies .
for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .
legal battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automotive industry is likely to take a battering the european commission is currently investigating 52.7 million euros -lrb- $ 68 million -rrb- in aid provided by poland to dell .
and that is by no means the only case that has pitted eu member states against one another in the race to save jobs .
france has drawn heavy criticism from fellow eu members for making its recent state aid package to the french automotive industry contingent on the companies agreeing not to move french jobs elsewhere in the bloc .
that has led a variety of countries including germany and belgium to accuse france of protectionism .

17 .
the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .

the us auto giant has already announced 47,000 job cuts worldwide . germany said on wednesday gm should come up with a rescue plan for opel even as worries mounted that the german-based carmaker would be a victim of gm 's global restructuring program .
" at the moment , politicians ca n't do anything because the necessary concepts from opel are not available , " german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday .
" and that ca n't happen without the parent company in detroit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has been buffeted by slumping car sales worldwide on tuesday , gm pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 billion -rrb- .
gm subsidiaries in europe are fearful of the potentially fatal cost-cutting and job losses that might imply for their operations .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
the troubled us carmaker said in its new survival plan that it needed about $ 6billion from several governments , including germany , sweden and the uk .
but germany has said gm should come up with a plan for opel if it wanted to get state support .
" the task that now lies ahead of us is a task that opel needs to address , together with its parent company general motors , " merkel said . " they have to present a concept that would ensure a positive outcome for opel . "
fear of job losses in germany in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , concern over job losses was growing quickly .
press reports have said at least one german plant could be among several european factories slated for closure .
a likely candidate is a site in western bochum , which last year lost a nokia mobile telephone plant .

trade unions and local politicians in germany have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs at the carmaker . many have called for opel to be split from its stricken us parent rather than face being dragged down with it .
gm europe mulling plan to save jobs on wednesday , gm europe directors and the group 's european works committee issued a joint statement saying they had begun talks on a " restructuring process " aimed at seeing how " job cuts and factory closures could be avoided . "
a joint statement said management is " prepared to talk about partnerships with and participations by third parties . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 18.02.2009 europe to lose 3.5 million jobs in 2009 , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more eu citizens will be looking for work , says the commission a new study by the eu commission says that jobless rolls in the european union will swell by a further 3.5 million this year as the global economic slowdown batters labor markets across europe . the eu executive 's new monthly survey , the first of which was published on tuesday , february 17 , indicates that joblessness is becoming an increasingly serious problem for the 27-member bloc .
" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .
the comission expects germany to lose around 500,000 jobs this year as europe 's largest economy struggles with its worst economic recession in decades .
competition over competitiveness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at unemployment has already caused civil unrest in latvia rising unemployment threatens not only to worsen the global economic slowdown , but to pit individual eu member states against one another as national governments try to save jobs for their own constituencies .
for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .
legal battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automotive industry is likely to take a battering the european commission is currently investigating 52.7 million euros -lrb- $ 68 million -rrb- in aid provided by poland to dell .
and that is by no means the only case that has pitted eu member states against one another in the race to save jobs .
france has drawn heavy criticism from fellow eu members for making its recent state aid package to the french automotive industry contingent on the companies agreeing not to move french jobs elsewhere in the bloc .
that has led a variety of countries including germany and belgium to accuse france of protectionism .
to try to address the problem , the eu has called an unofficial summit in brussels on march 1 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .
europe wants to coordinate approach the ecj decided that , under eu rules , people seeking the right to live in europe because they fear death at home do not have to prove that they , personally , are under threat of targeted violence , if the country itself is seen as sufficiently dangerous .
under exceptional circumstances , civilians can be allowed to stay in europe because there is so much indiscriminate violence in their homeland that they would be in danger if they stayed , the court said .
however , it was up to eu member states to decide when those exceptional circumstances applied , it said .
the eu is currently trying to build a common asylum policy , but is hampered by deep divisions between member states on the questions of who should qualify for protected status and how they should be treated .

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .

but not all iraqis agree with all aspects of germany 's policy . the german foreign minister spent wednesday , feb .
18 in the northern iraqi city of arbil before returning to germany .
while there , frank-walter steinmeier officially opened a new german consulate that is intended to symbolize renewed , closer ties between his country and post-war iraq .
" we want to assist in reconstruction , " steinmeier said , adding that his government respected the achievements of the iraqi people and the iraqi government .
against the backdrop of the relatively peaceful , semi-autonomous northern region , with its kurdish majority , steinmeier also said that he anticipated continued improvements in iraq 's security situation .
" i 'm certain that people in iraq will want to leave violence and hatred behind and build a common future for their country , " steinmeier said .
iraqi criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi government has tried to ensure the safety of the country 's christian minority steinmeier 's trip has been hailed as the start of a new chapter in relations between iraq and germany , which refused to participate in the 2003 us-led war that toppled saddam hussein , and which drastically reduced its involvement in the oil-rich , middle east country .
but things were n't all smiles and mutual compliments between steinmeier and his iraqi hosts .
on tuesday a deputy minister in the iraqi government , asghar al moussawi , took germany to task for helping christians leave iraq .
" the fact that certain governments are encouraging the emigration of iraq 's christians is unacceptable , " moussawi was quoted as saying by the centre for national media , an iraqi government organization .
in april 2008 , germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble urged european countries to offer refuge to iraqi christians .
that 's angered some iraqis .
" to encourage a group of any particular faith to leave the country is against international law and causes more harm than benefit to those people , " moussawi was quoted as saying .
it 's estimated that of the 800,000 christians who lived in iraq before the 2003 us-led invasion , around a quarter of a million have fled the country . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .
the german automotive industry may be likely to bounce back at some point , but for most companies at present , concrete signs of a recovery are difficult to see . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .
the german automotive industry may be likely to bounce back at some point , but for most companies at present , concrete signs of a recovery are difficult to see . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 in a bid to shore up the financial system by partially nationalizing especially troubled banks and , as a last resort , expropriating obstructionist shareholders . " there are other options , " merkel said .
" only if they fail will the ultima ratio come into play , the last resort of a disappropriation . " the draft bill is clearly tailored to address the problems created by ailing munich-based lender hypo real estate , or hre , a high-profile casualty of the financial crisis . the mortgage lender has already received 87 billion euros in state guarantees over the past year but has failed to recover .
and the german government has not received a single share of hre stock despite its investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet agreed the draft law on wednesday the government plans to draw up an " emergency takeover rescue law , " perhaps including fresh capital injections , for hre by april 3 .
it would then be presented to a general meeting of bank investors for approval .
only if that failed , would the disappropriation option be exercised . us private equity firm jc flowers owns a 25-percent stake of hre .
the german government has been trying to negotiate a buy-out for the past week - thus far without result . flowers purchased the stock last year for 22.50 euros a share , but share prices have since fallen to just over 1.50 euros . the specter of socialism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft law puts merkel at odds with business leaders like hundt other countries , including britain and ireland , have already taken control of stricken banks , justifying an expropriation of shareholders by pointing to the extraordinary nature of the global economic slowdown and the need to protect taxpayers . but a similar move is germany is all the more controversial because of germany 's nazi and communist pasts , when the state wantonly confiscated citizens ' property and assets . merkel has tried to portray the legislation as being fully in keeping with the german tradition of the " social market economy " - a free-market system steered by the government for the citizenry 's collective benefit . but some in the political opposition reject those characterizations . " expropriation is socialism , not social market economy , " the head of the opposition pro-business free democrats , guido westerwelle , told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but supporters say nationalization is needed to stop the downward spiral and germany business leaders are n't impressed either . " i am horrified that the government wants to open up a possibility for nationalizing a bank and disappropriating investors , " the president of the german employers ' federation , dieter hundt , said in an official statement . but the idea has gone down well with those on the political left in germany . " this sort of intelligent partial nationalization of banks is something we called for last year as part of the umbrella package to rescure the financial markets , " green party parliamentary leader fritz kuhn said in a statement . nonetheless , should merkel 's government decide that the last resort of expropriation is indeed their only option , the result would surely be a lawsuit in front of germany 's constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- jc / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 in a bid to shore up the financial system by partially nationalizing especially troubled banks and , as a last resort , expropriating obstructionist shareholders . " there are other options , " merkel said .
" only if they fail will the ultima ratio come into play , the last resort of a disappropriation . " the draft bill is clearly tailored to address the problems created by ailing munich-based lender hypo real estate , or hre , a high-profile casualty of the financial crisis . the mortgage lender has already received 87 billion euros in state guarantees over the past year but has failed to recover .
and the german government has not received a single share of hre stock despite its investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet agreed the draft law on wednesday the government plans to draw up an " emergency takeover rescue law , " perhaps including fresh capital injections , for hre by april 3 .
it would then be presented to a general meeting of bank investors for approval .
only if that failed , would the disappropriation option be exercised . us private equity firm jc flowers owns a 25-percent stake of hre .
the german government has been trying to negotiate a buy-out for the past week - thus far without result . flowers purchased the stock last year for 22.50 euros a share , but share prices have since fallen to just over 1.50 euros . the specter of socialism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft law puts merkel at odds with business leaders like hundt other countries , including britain and ireland , have already taken control of stricken banks , justifying an expropriation of shareholders by pointing to the extraordinary nature of the global economic slowdown and the need to protect taxpayers . but a similar move is germany is all the more controversial because of germany 's nazi and communist pasts , when the state wantonly confiscated citizens ' property and assets . merkel has tried to portray the legislation as being fully in keeping with the german tradition of the " social market economy " - a free-market system steered by the government for the citizenry 's collective benefit . but some in the political opposition reject those characterizations . " expropriation is socialism , not social market economy , " the head of the opposition pro-business free democrats , guido westerwelle , told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but supporters say nationalization is needed to stop the downward spiral and germany business leaders are n't impressed either . " i am horrified that the government wants to open up a possibility for nationalizing a bank and disappropriating investors , " the president of the german employers ' federation , dieter hundt , said in an official statement . but the idea has gone down well with those on the political left in germany . " this sort of intelligent partial nationalization of banks is something we called for last year as part of the umbrella package to rescure the financial markets , " green party parliamentary leader fritz kuhn said in a statement . nonetheless , should merkel 's government decide that the last resort of expropriation is indeed their only option , the result would surely be a lawsuit in front of germany 's constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- jc / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the american company said it plans to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide . in a plan presented to the us treasury department on tuesday , feb .
17 , general motors said it would be cutting jobs , closing factories , eliminating brands and scaling back production as part of a massive restructuring program designed to return the company to " sustainable profitability in 25 months . " " these are the kind of actions we need to take to survive the current industry crisis , and position gm for sustainability and success , " said gm chairman and ceo rick wagoner . wagoner said gm would need an additional $ 16 billion from the us government to stay afloat in the coming years .
the company received $ 13.4 billion dollars from the us government in december - the final $ 4 billion installment was delivered tuesday - but gm said it needed at least another 4.6 billion dollars in the short term to survive . the company is planning to sell off or phase out its hummer , saab and saturn brands and considering putting german opel on the block as well . talks with national governments continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm may end up selling off both saab and opel " we are in the middle of talking with the different sides , including the german government , " wagoner said of opel 's future while presenting gm restructuring plan . options on the table for opel and gm 's swedish unit saab include securing loan guarantees from berlin and stockholm and spinning off the two businesses as independent entities - a scenario favored by gm europe 's labor leaders . in addition to germany , the struggling us car giant is also in talks with governments in canada , sweden , britain and thailand for $ 6 billion " to provide liquidity specifically for gm 's operations in these countries , " gm said . germany is considering taking up a position in opel if gm is forced to declare bankruptcy , according to a report in tuesday 's financial times deutschland newspaper . considered a last resort , the idea was proposed during talks between federal and state government officials in states where opel factories are located , the paper reported without naming its sources . falling sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower sales figures have led to production halts in some factories gm sales plunged 49 percent in january as the us automotive industry became further engulfed in the country 's worst economic crisis in decades .
gm said that another 4.5 billion dollars would be necessary by 2011 , but that could rise to 12 billion dollars if the sales climate deteriorates even further . chrysler also submitted its restructuring plan earlier tuesday .
the smallest of the " big three " us carmakers has received $ 4 billion from the us government and said it would need a further $ 5 billion to avoid bankruptcy .
it plans to reduce capacity by 100,000 units and slash 3,000 jobs . the companies have until march 31 to prove to the government they can be commercially viable . the white house said a government-managed bankruptcy for the automakers remained a possibility , adding that a " strong and viable " us automobile industry was very important for the country . " i would n't preclude policy choices , particularly since we have n't seen details on what they think is ultimately going to be most helpful for them , " white house spokesman robert gibbs told reporters . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iraqi criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi government has tried to ensure the safety of the country 's christian minority steinmeier 's trip has been hailed as the start of a new chapter in relations between iraq and germany , which refused to participate in the 2003 us-led war that toppled saddam hussein , and which drastically reduced its involvement in the oil-rich , middle east country .
but things were n't all smiles and mutual compliments between steinmeier and his iraqi hosts .
on tuesday a deputy minister in the iraqi government , asghar al moussawi , took germany to task for helping christians leave iraq .
" the fact that certain governments are encouraging the emigration of iraq 's christians is unacceptable , " moussawi was quoted as saying by the centre for national media , an iraqi government organization .
in april 2008 , germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble urged european countries to offer refuge to iraqi christians .
that 's angered some iraqis .
" to encourage a group of any particular faith to leave the country is against international law and causes more harm than benefit to those people , " moussawi was quoted as saying .
it 's estimated that of the 800,000 christians who lived in iraq before the 2003 us-led invasion , around a quarter of a million have fled the country . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 in a bid to shore up the financial system by partially nationalizing especially troubled banks and , as a last resort , expropriating obstructionist shareholders . " there are other options , " merkel said .
" only if they fail will the ultima ratio come into play , the last resort of a disappropriation . " the draft bill is clearly tailored to address the problems created by ailing munich-based lender hypo real estate , or hre , a high-profile casualty of the financial crisis . the mortgage lender has already received 87 billion euros in state guarantees over the past year but has failed to recover .
and the german government has not received a single share of hre stock despite its investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet agreed the draft law on wednesday the government plans to draw up an " emergency takeover rescue law , " perhaps including fresh capital injections , for hre by april 3 .
it would then be presented to a general meeting of bank investors for approval .
only if that failed , would the disappropriation option be exercised . us private equity firm jc flowers owns a 25-percent stake of hre .
the german government has been trying to negotiate a buy-out for the past week - thus far without result . flowers purchased the stock last year for 22.50 euros a share , but share prices have since fallen to just over 1.50 euros . the specter of socialism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft law puts merkel at odds with business leaders like hundt other countries , including britain and ireland , have already taken control of stricken banks , justifying an expropriation of shareholders by pointing to the extraordinary nature of the global economic slowdown and the need to protect taxpayers . but a similar move is germany is all the more controversial because of germany 's nazi and communist pasts , when the state wantonly confiscated citizens ' property and assets . merkel has tried to portray the legislation as being fully in keeping with the german tradition of the " social market economy " - a free-market system steered by the government for the citizenry 's collective benefit . but some in the political opposition reject those characterizations . " expropriation is socialism , not social market economy , " the head of the opposition pro-business free democrats , guido westerwelle , told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but supporters say nationalization is needed to stop the downward spiral and germany business leaders are n't impressed either . " i am horrified that the government wants to open up a possibility for nationalizing a bank and disappropriating investors , " the president of the german employers ' federation , dieter hundt , said in an official statement . but the idea has gone down well with those on the political left in germany . " this sort of intelligent partial nationalization of banks is something we called for last year as part of the umbrella package to rescure the financial markets , " green party parliamentary leader fritz kuhn said in a statement . nonetheless , should merkel 's government decide that the last resort of expropriation is indeed their only option , the result would surely be a lawsuit in front of germany 's constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- jc / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 18.02.2009 europe to lose 3.5 million jobs in 2009 , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more eu citizens will be looking for work , says the commission a new study by the eu commission says that jobless rolls in the european union will swell by a further 3.5 million this year as the global economic slowdown batters labor markets across europe . the eu executive 's new monthly survey , the first of which was published on tuesday , february 17 , indicates that joblessness is becoming an increasingly serious problem for the 27-member bloc .
" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .
the comission expects germany to lose around 500,000 jobs this year as europe 's largest economy struggles with its worst economic recession in decades .
competition over competitiveness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at unemployment has already caused civil unrest in latvia rising unemployment threatens not only to worsen the global economic slowdown , but to pit individual eu member states against one another as national governments try to save jobs for their own constituencies .
for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .
legal battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the automotive industry is likely to take a battering the european commission is currently investigating 52.7 million euros -lrb- $ 68 million -rrb- in aid provided by poland to dell .
and that is by no means the only case that has pitted eu member states against one another in the race to save jobs .
france has drawn heavy criticism from fellow eu members for making its recent state aid package to the french automotive industry contingent on the companies agreeing not to move french jobs elsewhere in the bloc .
that has led a variety of countries including germany and belgium to accuse france of protectionism .
to try to address the problem , the eu has called an unofficial summit in brussels on march 1 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .

with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "

during his trip to the us he also plans to visit the un headquarters in new york .
following these meetings , muetzelburg is expected to travel to afghanistan and pakistan next week , to learn for himself about the situation on the ground .
germany has the third largest troop deployment under the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan .
germany to send more soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb attack hit the german embassy in kabul in january in addition to the 3,500 troops stationed in the region , nato diplomats announced on monday that berlin was to send another 600 troops to afghanistan , to provide additional safety ahead of the august presidential elections .
the election in august will be a key test for afghan president harmid karzai , who has become increasingly unpopular in the country due to widespread corruption .
once a darling of the west , karzai has also watched his support weaken there .
his central government is seen as weak and he has been unsuccessful in countering a growing taliban insurgency or curbing opium production .
german defense minister franz josef jung is expected to present berlin 's plans for the deployment during a meeting of nato defense ministers in krakow on thursday .
us leading the way president barack obama announced on tuesday he had signed orders to send the 17,000 additional troops as part of his initial plan to expand the us presence in afghanistan to counter a resurgent taliban , which has used sanctuary regions in pakistan to carry out attacks against coalition and afghan forces .

" i have to tell you that 2009 is going to be a tough year , " mckiernan told reporters at the pentagon , adding that he expects fighting to increase in the summer .
fighting in southern afghanistan , where it has been the heaviest , has produced a stalemate and it remains crucial to get soldiers in unprotected areas , mckiernan said .
" we need additional , persistent security presence in areas that we 're not at today , " mckiernan said .
" and then , in turn , the intent is that that would allow governance and other programs that will enable the population to resist an insurgency in the future . "
the 17,000 troop increase will widen the us presence to more than 50,000 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us auto giant has already announced 47,000 job cuts worldwide . germany said on wednesday gm should come up with a rescue plan for opel even as worries mounted that the german-based carmaker would be a victim of gm 's global restructuring program .
" at the moment , politicians ca n't do anything because the necessary concepts from opel are not available , " german chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday .
" and that ca n't happen without the parent company in detroit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors has been buffeted by slumping car sales worldwide on tuesday , gm pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 billion -rrb- .
gm subsidiaries in europe are fearful of the potentially fatal cost-cutting and job losses that might imply for their operations .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
the troubled us carmaker said in its new survival plan that it needed about $ 6billion from several governments , including germany , sweden and the uk .
but germany has said gm should come up with a plan for opel if it wanted to get state support .
" the task that now lies ahead of us is a task that opel needs to address , together with its parent company general motors , " merkel said . " they have to present a concept that would ensure a positive outcome for opel . "
fear of job losses in germany in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , concern over job losses was growing quickly .
press reports have said at least one german plant could be among several european factories slated for closure .
a likely candidate is a site in western bochum , which last year lost a nokia mobile telephone plant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at opel 's bochum plant have been shaken by news that gm is cutting 26,000 jobs outside the us opel has been hit badly by problems at its parent company . opel sales last year declined by more than 10 percent .
trade unions and local politicians in germany have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs at the carmaker . many have called for opel to be split from its stricken us parent rather than face being dragged down with it .
gm europe mulling plan to save jobs on wednesday , gm europe directors and the group 's european works committee issued a joint statement saying they had begun talks on a " restructuring process " aimed at seeing how " job cuts and factory closures could be avoided . "
a joint statement said management is " prepared to talk about partnerships with and participations by third parties . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opel 's future remains unclear under gm plan car giant general motors did not announce specific plans for its german subsidiary , opel , while requesting millions in aid from the us government .

are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2009 free-market fdp gains on bigger german political parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2009 could be a banner year for the free democrats the most recent public opinion poll puts the opposition business-friendly free democrats , or fdp , only four points behind the social democrats .
are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .
in the end , the party 's leading candidate only received 6.1 percent of the vote . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during his trip to the us he also plans to visit the un headquarters in new york .
following these meetings , muetzelburg is expected to travel to afghanistan and pakistan next week , to learn for himself about the situation on the ground .
germany has the third largest troop deployment under the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan .
germany to send more soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb attack hit the german embassy in kabul in january in addition to the 3,500 troops stationed in the region , nato diplomats announced on monday that berlin was to send another 600 troops to afghanistan , to provide additional safety ahead of the august presidential elections .
the election in august will be a key test for afghan president harmid karzai , who has become increasingly unpopular in the country due to widespread corruption .
once a darling of the west , karzai has also watched his support weaken there .
his central government is seen as weak and he has been unsuccessful in countering a growing taliban insurgency or curbing opium production .
german defense minister franz josef jung is expected to present berlin 's plans for the deployment during a meeting of nato defense ministers in krakow on thursday .
us leading the way president barack obama announced on tuesday he had signed orders to send the 17,000 additional troops as part of his initial plan to expand the us presence in afghanistan to counter a resurgent taliban , which has used sanctuary regions in pakistan to carry out attacks against coalition and afghan forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muetzelburg is germany 's first special envoy to pakistan and afghanistan the extra troops will be operational by this summer , the top commander of us and nato forces in the country said on wednesday .
but general david mckiernan also told reporters that despite the buildup , the destabilizing and violent situation in afghanistan is unlikely to be quickly reversed .
" i have to tell you that 2009 is going to be a tough year , " mckiernan told reporters at the pentagon , adding that he expects fighting to increase in the summer .
fighting in southern afghanistan , where it has been the heaviest , has produced a stalemate and it remains crucial to get soldiers in unprotected areas , mckiernan said .
" we need additional , persistent security presence in areas that we 're not at today , " mckiernan said .
" and then , in turn , the intent is that that would allow governance and other programs that will enable the population to resist an insurgency in the future . "

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .
the german automotive industry may be likely to bounce back at some point , but for most companies at present , concrete signs of a recovery are difficult to see . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .

the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .

the firm says it no longer needs to reduce workers ' hours .
but not every company is in ford 's position . ford germany announced late on tuesday , feb .
17 , that it was cancelling - at least until this summer - plans to put some of the employees at its plant in cologne on a part-time basis .
ford said that demand for the company 's cars had risen to the point that it would need to keep assembly lines running at full capacity .
the company attributed the increased demand to the premium of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,140 -rrb- offered by the german government for consumers to scrap older cars and buy new ones .
with customers increasingly interested in smaller , economy cars , ford models like the fiesta , the ka and the fusion have been selling well .
the company said that 10,000 orders for those models had been placed in the second half of january - a 400 percent rise compared with the same period last year .
the figures , ford said , were similar in france and italy .
but the company said it did not know whether reductions in working hours for employees at its plant in saarlouis in southwestern germany would also be cancelled .
better half a job than none bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the crisis is battering most automakers and car-parts producers many workers see going part time as the preferable option to perhaps losing one 's job entirely .
and unlike ford , many companies in the german automotive industry are n't in a position any more to do without this option .
the eastern german automotive-parts company autoliv , for example , has been forced to put some 80 percent of its workforce on part time .
autolive manufactures parts like seat belts .
due to the global economic slowdown , the company says it could not survive without reducing workers ' hours .
" from november to the begging of february alone , our plant 's business fell by 34 percent , " factory director silvia tagge told dw-radio .
" all our products have been affected , not just one or two .
we had to have a response commensurate to our loss in business . "
reduced working hours mean smaller paychecks , which is hard on employees .
" around 50 percent of our working hours have been made part-time , " autoliv seamstress uto kobold told deutsche welle .
" it 's a reduction in wages .
there are lots of single people with kids working for us - they really have to stretch to make ends meet . "
but many workers are just glad that they 've been spared the fate of redundancy .
" your first thought was : ' oh god , part-time !
what will be next ? " '
autoliv employee ilka rietschel told deutsche welle .
" but they employees did n't lose all hope because there 's always a recovery after every crisis .
it 's a question of when it 's coming , but you have to stay optimistic . "
to save on costs , autoliv plans to shut down production entirely for a week at the end of february .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2009 free-market fdp gains on bigger german political parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2009 could be a banner year for the free democrats the most recent public opinion poll puts the opposition business-friendly free democrats , or fdp , only four points behind the social democrats .
are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .

are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .
in the end , the party 's leading candidate only received 6.1 percent of the vote . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while there , frank-walter steinmeier officially opened a new german consulate that is intended to symbolize renewed , closer ties between his country and post-war iraq .
" we want to assist in reconstruction , " steinmeier said , adding that his government respected the achievements of the iraqi people and the iraqi government .
against the backdrop of the relatively peaceful , semi-autonomous northern region , with its kurdish majority , steinmeier also said that he anticipated continued improvements in iraq 's security situation .

" to encourage a group of any particular faith to leave the country is against international law and causes more harm than benefit to those people , " moussawi was quoted as saying .

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .

an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

and that is by no means the only case that has pitted eu member states against one another in the race to save jobs .
france has drawn heavy criticism from fellow eu members for making its recent state aid package to the french automotive industry contingent on the companies agreeing not to move french jobs elsewhere in the bloc .

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .
the comission expects germany to lose around 500,000 jobs this year as europe 's largest economy struggles with its worst economic recession in decades .
competition over competitiveness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at unemployment has already caused civil unrest in latvia rising unemployment threatens not only to worsen the global economic slowdown , but to pit individual eu member states against one another as national governments try to save jobs for their own constituencies .
for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

and that is by no means the only case that has pitted eu member states against one another in the race to save jobs .
france has drawn heavy criticism from fellow eu members for making its recent state aid package to the french automotive industry contingent on the companies agreeing not to move french jobs elsewhere in the bloc .
that has led a variety of countries including germany and belgium to accuse france of protectionism .

17 .
the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .
the elgafajis said that their lives would be in danger if they stayed in iraq .
the dutch justice ministry refused the application , saying that the couple had not proved that they would face a " serious and personal " threat if they returned home .
the couple appealed that decision in the dutch courts , which asked the ecj for advice .
europe wants to coordinate approach the ecj decided that , under eu rules , people seeking the right to live in europe because they fear death at home do not have to prove that they , personally , are under threat of targeted violence , if the country itself is seen as sufficiently dangerous .
under exceptional circumstances , civilians can be allowed to stay in europe because there is so much indiscriminate violence in their homeland that they would be in danger if they stayed , the court said .
however , it was up to eu member states to decide when those exceptional circumstances applied , it said .
the eu is currently trying to build a common asylum policy , but is hampered by deep divisions between member states on the questions of who should qualify for protected status and how they should be treated .
on wednesday , the eu 's executive , the european commission , is set to propose the creation of an eu-wide asylum support office to help member states coordinate their approaches . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us leading the way president barack obama announced on tuesday he had signed orders to send the 17,000 additional troops as part of his initial plan to expand the us presence in afghanistan to counter a resurgent taliban , which has used sanctuary regions in pakistan to carry out attacks against coalition and afghan forces .

but general david mckiernan also told reporters that despite the buildup , the destabilizing and violent situation in afghanistan is unlikely to be quickly reversed .
" i have to tell you that 2009 is going to be a tough year , " mckiernan told reporters at the pentagon , adding that he expects fighting to increase in the summer .
fighting in southern afghanistan , where it has been the heaviest , has produced a stalemate and it remains crucial to get soldiers in unprotected areas , mckiernan said .
" we need additional , persistent security presence in areas that we 're not at today , " mckiernan said .
" and then , in turn , the intent is that that would allow governance and other programs that will enable the population to resist an insurgency in the future . "
the 17,000 troop increase will widen the us presence to more than 50,000 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .

for example , there has been a testy exchange between representatives of limerick and lodz , after the computer company dell decided to move its european manufacturing headquarters from ireland to poland .
an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

" announced job losses now far outweigh those relating to job creation , " the report said , adding that " further deterioration is foreseen … with overall employment contracting by 1.6 percent , or some 3.5 million jobs . "
the report said that average unemployment in the eu , estimated at 7 percent in 2008 , would rise by 10 percent in 2009 .
the metalworking , automotive , financial and logistics industries were expected to be among the hardest-hit sectors , with the retail sector being one of the few positive areas .
and the report also said that unemployment would likely continue to rise in 2010 .
previous economic forecasts had predicted that the bloc 's economy would begin to recover slightly that year after staying in recession in 2009 .
but the eu now thinks that around a half a million jobs will be lost across the bloc in 2010 .
the study said job markets would shrink in all big european economies with ireland , spain and the baltic nations the worst-hit .

an estimated 1,900 of 3,000 jobs will be lost at dell 's limerick plant , as the company attempts to take advantage of lower wage costs in eastern europe .
" i am very , very bitter about this , " limerick mayor john gilligan told reuters news agency , adding that lodz 's gains could be short-lived since a rise in polish prosperity and wages might lead the company to pack their bags again .
" we are aware that dell moved here from somewhere else , and they could leave lodz one day , just as they have left limerick , " marek cieslak - president of the board of lodz special economic zone which offers tax incentives to foreign investors - said in an interview with reuters .

france has drawn heavy criticism from fellow eu members for making its recent state aid package to the french automotive industry contingent on the companies agreeing not to move french jobs elsewhere in the bloc .

but the treaty still has plenty of obstacles left before it is approved . after repeated delays , the czech parliament 's lower house narrowly passed the eu reform treaty on wednesday , feb .
18 .
the czech republic is the last member state yet to vote on the accord , which passed parliaments in 25 countries but was rejected by irish voters in a june 2008 referendum .
prime minister mirek topolanek , formerly an opponent of the lisbon treaty , said this week that he had changed his mind and would vote in favor of the pact .
the czech parliament passed the pact 125 to 61 on wednesday , but the vote was closer than it appeared .
a so-called " constitutional majority " of 120 of the 200-seat chamber had to approve the measure .
germany , poland also still have to sign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is awaiting a court ruling on the treaty if adopted by all member states , the treaty would overhaul eu institutions with the aim to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc .
but even in the czech republic , the treaty still has a ways to go .
it will also need the approval of the country 's senators and president , who may further drag out the ratification process .
czech president vaclav klaus , an opponent of the treaty , said earlier that he would sign it only after ireland overturns its " no " vote .
anti-lisbon senators may also delay the ratification process as they mull putting the treaty under a court review .
the czech reluctance has been a point of contention since the country 's government currently chairs the 27-member bloc .
the ratification process has not been completed in germany and poland , whose presidents are yet to ink the pact .
germany 's highest court also recently heard arguments that the treaty would undermine the power of the country 's legislative body . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 in a bid to shore up the financial system by partially nationalizing especially troubled banks and , as a last resort , expropriating obstructionist shareholders . " there are other options , " merkel said .
" only if they fail will the ultima ratio come into play , the last resort of a disappropriation . " the draft bill is clearly tailored to address the problems created by ailing munich-based lender hypo real estate , or hre , a high-profile casualty of the financial crisis . the mortgage lender has already received 87 billion euros in state guarantees over the past year but has failed to recover .
and the german government has not received a single share of hre stock despite its investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet agreed the draft law on wednesday the government plans to draw up an " emergency takeover rescue law , " perhaps including fresh capital injections , for hre by april 3 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 18.02.2009 reluctant czech lawmakers pass european treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union is still trying to pass a reform treaty the european union 's stalled reform pact , the lisbon treaty , has cleared the first hurdle in the czech republic 's parliament .
but the treaty still has plenty of obstacles left before it is approved . after repeated delays , the czech parliament 's lower house narrowly passed the eu reform treaty on wednesday , feb .
18 .
the czech republic is the last member state yet to vote on the accord , which passed parliaments in 25 countries but was rejected by irish voters in a june 2008 referendum .
prime minister mirek topolanek , formerly an opponent of the lisbon treaty , said this week that he had changed his mind and would vote in favor of the pact .
the czech parliament passed the pact 125 to 61 on wednesday , but the vote was closer than it appeared .
a so-called " constitutional majority " of 120 of the 200-seat chamber had to approve the measure .
germany , poland also still have to sign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is awaiting a court ruling on the treaty if adopted by all member states , the treaty would overhaul eu institutions with the aim to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc .
but even in the czech republic , the treaty still has a ways to go .
it will also need the approval of the country 's senators and president , who may further drag out the ratification process .
czech president vaclav klaus , an opponent of the treaty , said earlier that he would sign it only after ireland overturns its " no " vote .
anti-lisbon senators may also delay the ratification process as they mull putting the treaty under a court review .

18 in a bid to shore up the financial system by partially nationalizing especially troubled banks and , as a last resort , expropriating obstructionist shareholders . " there are other options , " merkel said .
" only if they fail will the ultima ratio come into play , the last resort of a disappropriation . " the draft bill is clearly tailored to address the problems created by ailing munich-based lender hypo real estate , or hre , a high-profile casualty of the financial crisis . the mortgage lender has already received 87 billion euros in state guarantees over the past year but has failed to recover .
and the german government has not received a single share of hre stock despite its investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's cabinet agreed the draft law on wednesday the government plans to draw up an " emergency takeover rescue law , " perhaps including fresh capital injections , for hre by april 3 .
it would then be presented to a general meeting of bank investors for approval .
only if that failed , would the disappropriation option be exercised . us private equity firm jc flowers owns a 25-percent stake of hre .
the german government has been trying to negotiate a buy-out for the past week - thus far without result . flowers purchased the stock last year for 22.50 euros a share , but share prices have since fallen to just over 1.50 euros . the specter of socialism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft law puts merkel at odds with business leaders like hundt other countries , including britain and ireland , have already taken control of stricken banks , justifying an expropriation of shareholders by pointing to the extraordinary nature of the global economic slowdown and the need to protect taxpayers . but a similar move is germany is all the more controversial because of germany 's nazi and communist pasts , when the state wantonly confiscated citizens ' property and assets . merkel has tried to portray the legislation as being fully in keeping with the german tradition of the " social market economy " - a free-market system steered by the government for the citizenry 's collective benefit . but some in the political opposition reject those characterizations . " expropriation is socialism , not social market economy , " the head of the opposition pro-business free democrats , guido westerwelle , told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but supporters say nationalization is needed to stop the downward spiral and germany business leaders are n't impressed either . " i am horrified that the government wants to open up a possibility for nationalizing a bank and disappropriating investors , " the president of the german employers ' federation , dieter hundt , said in an official statement . but the idea has gone down well with those on the political left in germany . " this sort of intelligent partial nationalization of banks is something we called for last year as part of the umbrella package to rescure the financial markets , " green party parliamentary leader fritz kuhn said in a statement . nonetheless , should merkel 's government decide that the last resort of expropriation is indeed their only option , the result would surely be a lawsuit in front of germany 's constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- jc / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling concerns iraqi couple meki and noor elgafaji , who in december 2006 applied for temporary residence permits in the netherlands .

under exceptional circumstances , civilians can be allowed to stay in europe because there is so much indiscriminate violence in their homeland that they would be in danger if they stayed , the court said .

but the treaty still has plenty of obstacles left before it is approved . after repeated delays , the czech parliament 's lower house narrowly passed the eu reform treaty on wednesday , feb .
18 .
the czech republic is the last member state yet to vote on the accord , which passed parliaments in 25 countries but was rejected by irish voters in a june 2008 referendum .
prime minister mirek topolanek , formerly an opponent of the lisbon treaty , said this week that he had changed his mind and would vote in favor of the pact .
the czech parliament passed the pact 125 to 61 on wednesday , but the vote was closer than it appeared .
a so-called " constitutional majority " of 120 of the 200-seat chamber had to approve the measure .
germany , poland also still have to sign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is awaiting a court ruling on the treaty if adopted by all member states , the treaty would overhaul eu institutions with the aim to streamline decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc .
but even in the czech republic , the treaty still has a ways to go .
it will also need the approval of the country 's senators and president , who may further drag out the ratification process .
czech president vaclav klaus , an opponent of the treaty , said earlier that he would sign it only after ireland overturns its " no " vote .
anti-lisbon senators may also delay the ratification process as they mull putting the treaty under a court review .
the czech reluctance has been a point of contention since the country 's government currently chairs the 27-member bloc .
the ratification process has not been completed in germany and poland , whose presidents are yet to ink the pact .
germany 's highest court also recently heard arguments that the treaty would undermine the power of the country 's legislative body . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are germans really going laissez-faire , or are the numbers deceiving ? a poll of 2,502 representative german citizens , which was published on wednesday , february 18 , put the level of support for the fdp at 18 percent .
it 's the second week in a row that the party has achieved that result in the poll , which has a margin of error of 2.5 percent .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped a point to 22 percent , suggesting that one of germany 's two traditional major parties enjoys only slightly more support than what has historically been a niche party .
with the conservatives holding steady at 34 percent , the poll also implies that the grouping of christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and fdp would command a solid majority if the national election scheduled for september were held today .
by contrast , the three left-wing parties - the spd and the two opposition parties , the left party and the greens , - would only garner 44 percent of the vote .
at least on the surface , the numbers represent an astonishing turnaround for the fdp , which as recently as 2002 had to worry about clearing the five-percent hurdle required for a party to be represented in the german parliament .
but observers disagree about what , if anything , the numbers really mean .
achievement or windfall ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp general secretary niebel , left , says conservatives have gone too social-democratic the head of the organization that carried out the poll , manfred guellner , says the fdp numbers reflect the dissatisfaction of right-wing voters with the compromise policies of conservatives in their grand coalition with the spd .
voters are " scared that words like nationalization and socialization are no longer taboo for conservatives , " guellner said in an interview with stern , the magazine that co-commissioned the poll .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel agreed with the assessment .
" we 're basically being ruled by two different social democratic parties with different party colors , " niebel told the ap news agency , adding that the fdp would insist on a coalition that reflected its free-market , low-tax agenda .
but horst seehofer - the head of the bavarian csu - said the poll numbers were mere " windfall profits , " i.e. undeserved gains made without any achievement on the fdp 's part .
" we are a broad-based and not a clientele party , " seehofer told the rheinische post newspaper .
" and a modern broad-based party takes account of social , economic , ecological and national-traditional issues . "
an anti-party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the party 's previous " project 18 " was a disaster what 's likely is that the fdp is benefitting from a general dissatisfaction with germany 's two largest parties in troubled economic times .
the social democrats in particular , and the left in general , have lost appeal because the spd leadership has been seen as weak , and the party has few opportunities to shine as the junior partners of the grand coalition .
meanwhile , personnel and ideological disagreements such as those surrounding the recent sudden resignation of former economics minister michael glos have hurt public perceptions of the conservatives ' ability to lead effectively .
but the fdp may find it difficult to maintain momentum since significant numbers of germans hold free-market policies like those advanced by the free democrats to be partially responsible for the country 's economic woes .
and history should give party members pause for thought .
in the 2002 parliamentary elections , the fdp launched a " project 18 " publicity campaign aimed at garnering that percentage of support .
in the end , the party 's leading candidate only received 6.1 percent of the vote . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the estimate , made by a uk official working in the province , was contained in emails obtained by the bbc .
international forces are fighting a fierce counter-insurgency campaign against taleban militants and other insurgents in helmand .
but british officials are clearly worried about the reliability of the afghan police .
" we are very concerned by the levels of drug abuse among the police , " the british foreign office said in a statement .
" the police are poorly paid , do high risk work and are poorly trained .
there are high levels of corruption in the police as well as drug use and supporting counter-narcotics is a key priority for the uk , " it said .
meanwhile , 700 british and afghan troops were involved in raids on four factories in helmand , seizing heroin and drug-making chemicals with an estimated street value of more than £ 50m .
defence secretary john hutton praised the troops ' bravery and said the seizures in helmand province would starve the taleban of funding .
' huge problem ' the training of the afghan security forces has been a central plank in the international community 's strategy to help stabilise the country . "
the police are constantly under threat from the taleban .

helmand province produces almost two-thirds of the world 's opium , which is used to manufacture heroin .
the provincial governor , gulab mangal , told the bbc that drug use was a " huge problem " amongst police stationed in the province .
he added that steps were being taken to tackle the issue and that " at least 10 " police officers had recently been dismissed after failing drugs tests .
' pressure valve ' drug use amongst the police is not just confined to helmand , but is a nationwide problem , according to the emails , obtained by the bbc under a freedom of information act request made to the foreign office .
from the bbc world service more from bbc world service of 5,320 afghan police and recruits tested by us-led police training programmes across the country , 16 % were found to be using drugs .

police work in these areas is also highly dangerous and low paid - reasons , analysts say , for widespread drug use .
" the police are constantly under threat from the taleban , " says abdul ghafoor , director of the regional studies centre of afghanistan , a think-tank based in kabul .

danny boyle 's slumdog millionaire has already hit the headlines for its achievements - the first indian film to win a golden globe and a record number of awards and nominations at the prestigious bafta ceremony .
this has understandably brought the film 's actors and musicians into the limelight .
but before too long the film 's technicians could also be basking in cinematic glory .
resul pookutty won the bafta for sound design for slumdog millionaire with glenn freemantle , richard pryke , tom sayers and ian tapp .
aesthetic freedom since then " sound guys " in the indian film industry have become the subject of much discussion and attention .
sound technicians are the people who make a film sound like it does - recording on location and editing and reworking of sound effects during post-production .
in india , they are called sound engineer , sound technician or sound designer and each job has its own definition depending on the aesthetic freedom they get .
work ranges from merely recording and repairing to composing , mixing , editing of various sounds , dubbing and background score .
resul pookutty , a graduate from the prestigious film and television institute of india , has been in the industry for over 10 years and has worked on several big films .
he is now a household name in india and is hotly tipped to win an oscar this year .
at his studio in suburban mumbai , three other sound engineers work on several films .
what we need is a change of attitude from producers and directors sound engineer dean picardo amrit , who worked with mr pookutty on slumdog , says that over 50 to 60 sounds are mixed to create a particular sound which may last for not more than 20 seconds .
there is lot of work , both indoors and outdoors , but it is hardly noticed by people , he says .
he points out that working on locations in mumbai was one of the toughest challenges for slumdog .
" it was not an easy film to do .
even though it had a small budget , technically it was one of the most advanced . "
over the last decade mr pookutty has seen the industry change .
" in the early 1990s the equipment was not enough to do live sound or sync sound .
now sync sound technique has increased and it 's a great change . "
filmmakers say it is only now that experiments with sound have started .
constant struggle anurag kashyap , who made films like black friday , no smoking and more recently , dev d , has used ample experimentation in sound in his films .
he says that in earlier days , people used background score from stock sounds but now young filmmakers are trying to use it differently .
if you have it , you 'll make it in this industry .
it takes time , but it is about passion sound engineer ganesh g " i find the right people for each of my films and then work with them .
every film needs a different score . "
another well known film maker , rajat kapoor , has made several off-beat low budget films and worked with resul pookutty for over a decade .
" in the 50 's hindi cinema used sound very well .
films like mahal -lrb- one of the earliest suspense-horror films -rrb- had phenomenal sound .
" however , the 1970s , 80s and 90s were bad times for cinema , every aspect degenerated .
now with the coming of multiplexes and different filmmakers , more attention is being paid to visual and sound aspects . "
however , for most sound engineers a constant struggle is the reality .
dean picardo , who works at purple haze , a well known studio in mumbai , says that in terms of talent and equipment india does not lag behind .
" the budget that is set aside for the sound department by the producer is much lower than other departments like cinematography and actor fees , " he says .
" that has to change .
for example when films are shot in new york , the police help in keeping the crowds who gather silent .
here a sound designer has to work with the crew to keep crowds quiet . "
in india , sound engineers could start their career " working for free " , getting around $ 200 to $ 300 per month for a long time .
however the top technicians make several times more .
despite the rough ride , most sound engineers swear by their profession .
platform ganesh g , a sound engineer who works with a big production house , says that perseverance is the key .
mr pookuty says recording sounds for slumdog posed new challenges " if you are really passionate you do n't give up .
if you have it , you 'll make it in this industry .
it takes time , but it is about passion . "
mr picardo agrees .
he says that says if the project is exciting enough , every sound technician will do the job , no matter what the obstacles .
" no one thrives , they only survive .
it 's a fight on daily basis on personal as well as professional front .
but we do it . "
mr pookutty feels that today sound engineers are getting paid better because of the dearth of qualified trained professionals .
but others feel they have a long way to go before they get remuneration to match their work and talent .
filmmakers and technicians unanimously agree , though , that the success of slumdog millionaire has provided a platform and a benchmark for indian technicians .
they hope that things from now onwards will only get better .

but before too long the film 's technicians could also be basking in cinematic glory .
resul pookutty won the bafta for sound design for slumdog millionaire with glenn freemantle , richard pryke , tom sayers and ian tapp .
aesthetic freedom since then " sound guys " in the indian film industry have become the subject of much discussion and attention .
sound technicians are the people who make a film sound like it does - recording on location and editing and reworking of sound effects during post-production .
in india , they are called sound engineer , sound technician or sound designer and each job has its own definition depending on the aesthetic freedom they get .
work ranges from merely recording and repairing to composing , mixing , editing of various sounds , dubbing and background score .
resul pookutty , a graduate from the prestigious film and television institute of india , has been in the industry for over 10 years and has worked on several big films .
he is now a household name in india and is hotly tipped to win an oscar this year .
at his studio in suburban mumbai , three other sound engineers work on several films .
what we need is a change of attitude from producers and directors sound engineer dean picardo amrit , who worked with mr pookutty on slumdog , says that over 50 to 60 sounds are mixed to create a particular sound which may last for not more than 20 seconds .
there is lot of work , both indoors and outdoors , but it is hardly noticed by people , he says .
he points out that working on locations in mumbai was one of the toughest challenges for slumdog .
" it was not an easy film to do .
even though it had a small budget , technically it was one of the most advanced . "
over the last decade mr pookutty has seen the industry change .
" in the early 1990s the equipment was not enough to do live sound or sync sound .
now sync sound technique has increased and it 's a great change . "
filmmakers say it is only now that experiments with sound have started .
constant struggle anurag kashyap , who made films like black friday , no smoking and more recently , dev d , has used ample experimentation in sound in his films .
he says that in earlier days , people used background score from stock sounds but now young filmmakers are trying to use it differently .
if you have it , you 'll make it in this industry .
it takes time , but it is about passion sound engineer ganesh g " i find the right people for each of my films and then work with them .
every film needs a different score . "
another well known film maker , rajat kapoor , has made several off-beat low budget films and worked with resul pookutty for over a decade .
" in the 50 's hindi cinema used sound very well .
films like mahal -lrb- one of the earliest suspense-horror films -rrb- had phenomenal sound .
" however , the 1970s , 80s and 90s were bad times for cinema , every aspect degenerated .
now with the coming of multiplexes and different filmmakers , more attention is being paid to visual and sound aspects . "
however , for most sound engineers a constant struggle is the reality .
dean picardo , who works at purple haze , a well known studio in mumbai , says that in terms of talent and equipment india does not lag behind .
" the budget that is set aside for the sound department by the producer is much lower than other departments like cinematography and actor fees , " he says .
" that has to change .
for example when films are shot in new york , the police help in keeping the crowds who gather silent .
here a sound designer has to work with the crew to keep crowds quiet . "
in india , sound engineers could start their career " working for free " , getting around $ 200 to $ 300 per month for a long time .
however the top technicians make several times more .
despite the rough ride , most sound engineers swear by their profession .
platform ganesh g , a sound engineer who works with a big production house , says that perseverance is the key .
mr pookuty says recording sounds for slumdog posed new challenges " if you are really passionate you do n't give up .
if you have it , you 'll make it in this industry .
it takes time , but it is about passion . "
mr picardo agrees .
he says that says if the project is exciting enough , every sound technician will do the job , no matter what the obstacles .
" no one thrives , they only survive .
it 's a fight on daily basis on personal as well as professional front .
but we do it . "
mr pookutty feels that today sound engineers are getting paid better because of the dearth of qualified trained professionals .
but others feel they have a long way to go before they get remuneration to match their work and talent .
filmmakers and technicians unanimously agree , though , that the success of slumdog millionaire has provided a platform and a benchmark for indian technicians .
they hope that things from now onwards will only get better .

danny boyle 's slumdog millionaire has already hit the headlines for its achievements - the first indian film to win a golden globe and a record number of awards and nominations at the prestigious bafta ceremony .
this has understandably brought the film 's actors and musicians into the limelight .
but before too long the film 's technicians could also be basking in cinematic glory .
resul pookutty won the bafta for sound design for slumdog millionaire with glenn freemantle , richard pryke , tom sayers and ian tapp .
aesthetic freedom since then " sound guys " in the indian film industry have become the subject of much discussion and attention .
sound technicians are the people who make a film sound like it does - recording on location and editing and reworking of sound effects during post-production .
in india , they are called sound engineer , sound technician or sound designer and each job has its own definition depending on the aesthetic freedom they get .
work ranges from merely recording and repairing to composing , mixing , editing of various sounds , dubbing and background score .
resul pookutty , a graduate from the prestigious film and television institute of india , has been in the industry for over 10 years and has worked on several big films .
he is now a household name in india and is hotly tipped to win an oscar this year .
at his studio in suburban mumbai , three other sound engineers work on several films .
what we need is a change of attitude from producers and directors sound engineer dean picardo amrit , who worked with mr pookutty on slumdog , says that over 50 to 60 sounds are mixed to create a particular sound which may last for not more than 20 seconds .
there is lot of work , both indoors and outdoors , but it is hardly noticed by people , he says .
he points out that working on locations in mumbai was one of the toughest challenges for slumdog .
" it was not an easy film to do .
even though it had a small budget , technically it was one of the most advanced . "
over the last decade mr pookutty has seen the industry change .
" in the early 1990s the equipment was not enough to do live sound or sync sound .
now sync sound technique has increased and it 's a great change . "
filmmakers say it is only now that experiments with sound have started .
constant struggle anurag kashyap , who made films like black friday , no smoking and more recently , dev d , has used ample experimentation in sound in his films .
he says that in earlier days , people used background score from stock sounds but now young filmmakers are trying to use it differently .
if you have it , you 'll make it in this industry .
it takes time , but it is about passion sound engineer ganesh g " i find the right people for each of my films and then work with them .
every film needs a different score . "
another well known film maker , rajat kapoor , has made several off-beat low budget films and worked with resul pookutty for over a decade .
" in the 50 's hindi cinema used sound very well .
films like mahal -lrb- one of the earliest suspense-horror films -rrb- had phenomenal sound .
" however , the 1970s , 80s and 90s were bad times for cinema , every aspect degenerated .
now with the coming of multiplexes and different filmmakers , more attention is being paid to visual and sound aspects . "
however , for most sound engineers a constant struggle is the reality .
dean picardo , who works at purple haze , a well known studio in mumbai , says that in terms of talent and equipment india does not lag behind .
" the budget that is set aside for the sound department by the producer is much lower than other departments like cinematography and actor fees , " he says .
" that has to change .
for example when films are shot in new york , the police help in keeping the crowds who gather silent .
here a sound designer has to work with the crew to keep crowds quiet . "
in india , sound engineers could start their career " working for free " , getting around $ 200 to $ 300 per month for a long time .
however the top technicians make several times more .
despite the rough ride , most sound engineers swear by their profession .
platform ganesh g , a sound engineer who works with a big production house , says that perseverance is the key .
mr pookuty says recording sounds for slumdog posed new challenges " if you are really passionate you do n't give up .
if you have it , you 'll make it in this industry .
it takes time , but it is about passion . "
mr picardo agrees .
he says that says if the project is exciting enough , every sound technician will do the job , no matter what the obstacles .
" no one thrives , they only survive .
it 's a fight on daily basis on personal as well as professional front .
but we do it . "
mr pookutty feels that today sound engineers are getting paid better because of the dearth of qualified trained professionals .
but others feel they have a long way to go before they get remuneration to match their work and talent .
filmmakers and technicians unanimously agree , though , that the success of slumdog millionaire has provided a platform and a benchmark for indian technicians .
they hope that things from now onwards will only get better .

danny boyle 's slumdog millionaire has already hit the headlines for its achievements - the first indian film to win a golden globe and a record number of awards and nominations at the prestigious bafta ceremony .
this has understandably brought the film 's actors and musicians into the limelight .
but before too long the film 's technicians could also be basking in cinematic glory .
resul pookutty won the bafta for sound design for slumdog millionaire with glenn freemantle , richard pryke , tom sayers and ian tapp .
aesthetic freedom since then " sound guys " in the indian film industry have become the subject of much discussion and attention .
sound technicians are the people who make a film sound like it does - recording on location and editing and reworking of sound effects during post-production .
in india , they are called sound engineer , sound technician or sound designer and each job has its own definition depending on the aesthetic freedom they get .
work ranges from merely recording and repairing to composing , mixing , editing of various sounds , dubbing and background score .
resul pookutty , a graduate from the prestigious film and television institute of india , has been in the industry for over 10 years and has worked on several big films .
he is now a household name in india and is hotly tipped to win an oscar this year .
at his studio in suburban mumbai , three other sound engineers work on several films .
what we need is a change of attitude from producers and directors sound engineer dean picardo amrit , who worked with mr pookutty on slumdog , says that over 50 to 60 sounds are mixed to create a particular sound which may last for not more than 20 seconds .
there is lot of work , both indoors and outdoors , but it is hardly noticed by people , he says .
he points out that working on locations in mumbai was one of the toughest challenges for slumdog .
" it was not an easy film to do .
even though it had a small budget , technically it was one of the most advanced . "
over the last decade mr pookutty has seen the industry change .
" in the early 1990s the equipment was not enough to do live sound or sync sound .
now sync sound technique has increased and it 's a great change . "
filmmakers say it is only now that experiments with sound have started .
constant struggle anurag kashyap , who made films like black friday , no smoking and more recently , dev d , has used ample experimentation in sound in his films .
he says that in earlier days , people used background score from stock sounds but now young filmmakers are trying to use it differently .
if you have it , you 'll make it in this industry .
it takes time , but it is about passion sound engineer ganesh g " i find the right people for each of my films and then work with them .
every film needs a different score . "
another well known film maker , rajat kapoor , has made several off-beat low budget films and worked with resul pookutty for over a decade .

resul pookutty won the bafta for sound design for slumdog millionaire with glenn freemantle , richard pryke , tom sayers and ian tapp .
aesthetic freedom since then " sound guys " in the indian film industry have become the subject of much discussion and attention .
sound technicians are the people who make a film sound like it does - recording on location and editing and reworking of sound effects during post-production .
in india , they are called sound engineer , sound technician or sound designer and each job has its own definition depending on the aesthetic freedom they get .
work ranges from merely recording and repairing to composing , mixing , editing of various sounds , dubbing and background score .
resul pookutty , a graduate from the prestigious film and television institute of india , has been in the industry for over 10 years and has worked on several big films .
he is now a household name in india and is hotly tipped to win an oscar this year .
at his studio in suburban mumbai , three other sound engineers work on several films .
what we need is a change of attitude from producers and directors sound engineer dean picardo amrit , who worked with mr pookutty on slumdog , says that over 50 to 60 sounds are mixed to create a particular sound which may last for not more than 20 seconds .
there is lot of work , both indoors and outdoors , but it is hardly noticed by people , he says .
he points out that working on locations in mumbai was one of the toughest challenges for slumdog .
" it was not an easy film to do .
even though it had a small budget , technically it was one of the most advanced . "
over the last decade mr pookutty has seen the industry change .
" in the early 1990s the equipment was not enough to do live sound or sync sound .
now sync sound technique has increased and it 's a great change . "
filmmakers say it is only now that experiments with sound have started .
constant struggle anurag kashyap , who made films like black friday , no smoking and more recently , dev d , has used ample experimentation in sound in his films .
he says that in earlier days , people used background score from stock sounds but now young filmmakers are trying to use it differently .
if you have it , you 'll make it in this industry .
it takes time , but it is about passion sound engineer ganesh g " i find the right people for each of my films and then work with them .
every film needs a different score . "
another well known film maker , rajat kapoor , has made several off-beat low budget films and worked with resul pookutty for over a decade .
" in the 50 's hindi cinema used sound very well .
films like mahal -lrb- one of the earliest suspense-horror films -rrb- had phenomenal sound .
" however , the 1970s , 80s and 90s were bad times for cinema , every aspect degenerated .
now with the coming of multiplexes and different filmmakers , more attention is being paid to visual and sound aspects . "
however , for most sound engineers a constant struggle is the reality .
dean picardo , who works at purple haze , a well known studio in mumbai , says that in terms of talent and equipment india does not lag behind .
" the budget that is set aside for the sound department by the producer is much lower than other departments like cinematography and actor fees , " he says .
" that has to change .
for example when films are shot in new york , the police help in keeping the crowds who gather silent .
here a sound designer has to work with the crew to keep crowds quiet . "
in india , sound engineers could start their career " working for free " , getting around $ 200 to $ 300 per month for a long time .
however the top technicians make several times more .
despite the rough ride , most sound engineers swear by their profession .
platform ganesh g , a sound engineer who works with a big production house , says that perseverance is the key .
mr pookuty says recording sounds for slumdog posed new challenges " if you are really passionate you do n't give up .
if you have it , you 'll make it in this industry .
it takes time , but it is about passion . "
mr picardo agrees .
he says that says if the project is exciting enough , every sound technician will do the job , no matter what the obstacles .
" no one thrives , they only survive .
it 's a fight on daily basis on personal as well as professional front .
but we do it . "
mr pookutty feels that today sound engineers are getting paid better because of the dearth of qualified trained professionals .
but others feel they have a long way to go before they get remuneration to match their work and talent .
filmmakers and technicians unanimously agree , though , that the success of slumdog millionaire has provided a platform and a benchmark for indian technicians .
they hope that things from now onwards will only get better .

america 's new commander-in-chief approved the deployment of a further 17,000 military personnel to afghanistan .
in a statement released by the white house , president obama said " the situation in afghanistan and pakistan demands urgent attention " .
military advisers to the president have made it clear that the situation in afghanistan is destabilising quickly .
according to a report from the united nations , the number of civilian deaths increased by 39 % in 2008 .
the obama administration is also extremely concerned about a resurgence of the taleban - a force that was ousted back in 2001 .
according to some reports they now control huge areas within the country and that is something america wants desperately to change .
crucial time throughout his presidential campaign mr obama made it clear he was going to shift the emphasis away from iraq and focus more resources on afghanistan .
commanders on the ground have asked for an additional 30,000 troops and there is speculation that they may just get what they want .
that could see up to 60,000 troops in afghanistan , almost doubling the number of soldiers on the ground today .
the 17,000 new additions will arrive in time for the warmer weather in afghanistan .
that , say military advisers , usually brings an increase in fighting .
the deployment will be made up of 8,000 marines , and 4,000 army soldiers , plus another 5,000 support staff .
they will serve in the south of afghanistan , where the violence has been worst .
they will also arrive ahead of the national elections in august , a crucial time for afghanistan .

president obama and his team are working on a new strategy for the region .
they plan to present what the white house is calling " achievable goals " and a " comprehensive strategy " for their approach to afghanistan .
that review is due to be announced at the end of march - just before the next nato summit .
that is no accident .
the operation in afghanistan is a multi-national one and it is clear that america can not achieve any kind of victory alone .
president obama says he wants to move forward " in concert with our friends and allies " - a clear indication that he could well call on nato and its member countries to commit more of their resources to afghanistan .
that could be another battle that the obama administration will have to fight , but it is clear that the us , under its new commander-in-chief , will be in afghanistan for many years to come .

slovenia , the first former yugoslav nation to join the eu in 2004 , has been blocking talks with croatia because of the 18-year-old dispute , which mainly concerns a small bay in the adriatic sea .
seen from a boat , piran is a glorious sight - a venetian-style city built of limestone and marble , lapped by the blue waters of the adriatic .
it 's easily missed on a map , but this small bay of just 20 square km -lrb- eight square miles -rrb- is making big diplomatic waves .
border line the row centres on access to international waters , which slovenia treasures because its coastline is just 46km -lrb- 29 miles -rrb- long .
by contrast , croatia 's huge adriatic coast stretches for 1,700km -lrb- 1056 miles -rrb- .
however , croatia claims that the border should be drawn down the middle of the bay of piran , which slovenia fears would deny its ships direct passage to the high seas .
when both nations were part of yugoslavia , borders did n't really matter .
but since they declared independence in 1991 , incidents have flared up in the bay , with fishing boats seized and nets damaged .
" it 's a big problem , " said milenko bulezan , a fisherman for 20 years .
" if we know where the border is , we go to that line , but we do n't know now . "
" we 're afraid to go over this border , " mr bulezan said .
" the adriatic sea before was also for slovenia , not just for the croatian side . "
veto power slovenia is smaller than croatia , but it holds a powerful position .
like any eu member state , it can veto croatia 's bid . "
our vital interests are still hurt by the documents that were brought into the eu process " samuel zbogar slovenian foreign minister last december , it did exactly that , blocking a large chunk of its neighbour 's accession talks .
the reason , according to slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar , was that croatia had provided maps and documents in the eu negotiations that would have pre-judged a solution to the border dispute .
" we have problems allowing croatia to continue negotiations , because our vital interests are still hurt by the documents that were brought into the eu process , " mr zbogar says .
time is running out for croatia .
unless the stalemate is broken in the next few weeks , it is unlikely to complete eu membership talks by the end of the year .
but the two countries differ on the solution . "
because of this issue we are now in the blockade " gordan jandrokovic croatian foreign minister slovenia prefers eu mediation , possibly led by the nobel peace prize winner martti ahtisaari , the man who drew up the blueprint for kosovo 's independence .
croatia says the border dispute is a legal issue , not a political one , and should be handled by the international court of justice in the hague .
" we have one bilateral issue which is not related to our negotiation process , " croatian foreign minister gordan jandrokovic said .
" and because of this issue we are now in the blockade . "
" the message is that if we fulfil all that 's necessary for membership , if we undertake some reforms that are very painful , there is no guarantee that we will become a member of the eu , " he added .
facebook wars almost uniquely in the former yugoslavia , croatia and slovenia have never gone to war with each other .
but the border dispute has now sparked what some call the facebook wars .
over 40,000 croats have joined a group on the social networking site calling for a boycott of slovenian products .
outside a slovenian-owned shopping mall in the croatian capital zagreb , several people said they did n't think they were getting fair treatment .
" i do not love slovenians because they always act like we are enemies , " one young mother told me .
" they are small , they have their frustration about that , they want the croatian coast , everything . "
" we could live together like good neighbours , but from the beginning , slovenians are n't acting like friends , " she said .
two hours ' drive away , in the slovenian capital ljubljana , student nejc jemec showed me a facebook group called " slovenia + croatia = best friends . "
he joined it along with thousands of others to protest against another group , " red light to croatia , " which supports the government 's tough line .
" i hope that things will get better in the future , " nejc said , " and that people will prepare not to think irrationally , but to admit that it would be probably easier for both of us if we were both members of the eu , it would be easier to solve problems . "
dangerous precedent a meeting between the prime ministers of slovenia and croatia later this month may lead to a solution .
but no date has been set .
a complicating factor is the attempt by two slovenian nationalist groups to hold a referendum on croatia 's nato accession .
they say croatia should be prevented from joining the alliance at a summit in april because of the border dispute .
a nato spokesman voiced concern at the move , which would be unprecedented .
macedonia 's hopes to join nato and the eu have also been dealt a serious blow by greece , because of a row over the country 's name , which athens believes could lead to territorial claims .
as serbia and other balkan nations line up to join the western clubs , there 's growing concern that a dangerous precedent has been set .

slovenia , the first former yugoslav nation to join the eu in 2004 , has been blocking talks with croatia because of the 18-year-old dispute , which mainly concerns a small bay in the adriatic sea .
seen from a boat , piran is a glorious sight - a venetian-style city built of limestone and marble , lapped by the blue waters of the adriatic .
it 's easily missed on a map , but this small bay of just 20 square km -lrb- eight square miles -rrb- is making big diplomatic waves .
border line the row centres on access to international waters , which slovenia treasures because its coastline is just 46km -lrb- 29 miles -rrb- long .
by contrast , croatia 's huge adriatic coast stretches for 1,700km -lrb- 1056 miles -rrb- .
however , croatia claims that the border should be drawn down the middle of the bay of piran , which slovenia fears would deny its ships direct passage to the high seas .
when both nations were part of yugoslavia , borders did n't really matter .
but since they declared independence in 1991 , incidents have flared up in the bay , with fishing boats seized and nets damaged .
" it 's a big problem , " said milenko bulezan , a fisherman for 20 years .
" if we know where the border is , we go to that line , but we do n't know now . "
" we 're afraid to go over this border , " mr bulezan said .
" the adriatic sea before was also for slovenia , not just for the croatian side . "
veto power slovenia is smaller than croatia , but it holds a powerful position .
like any eu member state , it can veto croatia 's bid .
our vital interests are still hurt by the documents that were brought into the eu process samuel zbogar slovenian foreign minister last december , it did exactly that , blocking a large chunk of its neighbour 's accession talks .
the reason , according to slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar , was that croatia had provided maps and documents in the eu negotiations that would have pre-judged a solution to the border dispute .
" we have problems allowing croatia to continue negotiations , because our vital interests are still hurt by the documents that were brought into the eu process , " mr zbogar says .
time is running out for croatia .
unless the stalemate is broken in the next few weeks , it is unlikely to complete eu membership talks by the end of the year .
but the two countries differ on the solution .
because of this issue we are now in the blockade gordan jandrokovic croatian foreign minister slovenia prefers eu mediation , possibly led by the nobel peace prize winner martti ahtisaari , the man who drew up the blueprint for kosovo 's independence .
croatia says the border dispute is a legal issue , not a political one , and should be handled by the international court of justice in the hague .
" we have one bilateral issue which is not related to our negotiation process , " croatian foreign minister gordan jandrokovic said .
" and because of this issue we are now in the blockade . "
" the message is that if we fulfil all that 's necessary for membership , if we undertake some reforms that are very painful , there is no guarantee that we will become a member of the eu , " he added .
facebook wars almost uniquely in the former yugoslavia , croatia and slovenia have never gone to war with each other .
but the border dispute has now sparked what some call the facebook wars .
the dispute has sparked ' facebook wars ' between rival lobby groups over 40,000 croats have joined a group on the social networking site calling for a boycott of slovenian products .
outside a slovenian-owned shopping mall in the croatian capital zagreb , several people said they did n't think they were getting fair treatment .
" i do not love slovenians because they always act like we are enemies , " one young mother told me .
" they are small , they have their frustration about that , they want the croatian coast , everything . "
" we could live together like good neighbours , but from the beginning , slovenians are n't acting like friends , " she said .
two hours ' drive away , in the slovenian capital ljubljana , student nejc jemec showed me a facebook group called " slovenia + croatia = best friends . "
he joined it along with thousands of others to protest against another group , " red light to croatia , " which supports the government 's tough line .
" i hope that things will get better in the future , " nejc said , " and that people will prepare not to think irrationally , but to admit that it would be probably easier for both of us if we were both members of the eu , it would be easier to solve problems . "
dangerous precedent a meeting between the prime ministers of slovenia and croatia later this month may lead to a solution .
but no date has been set .
a complicating factor is the attempt by two slovenian nationalist groups to hold a referendum on croatia 's nato accession .

our vital interests are still hurt by the documents that were brought into the eu process samuel zbogar slovenian foreign minister last december , it did exactly that , blocking a large chunk of its neighbour 's accession talks .
the reason , according to slovenian foreign minister samuel zbogar , was that croatia had provided maps and documents in the eu negotiations that would have pre-judged a solution to the border dispute .
" we have problems allowing croatia to continue negotiations , because our vital interests are still hurt by the documents that were brought into the eu process , " mr zbogar says .
time is running out for croatia .
unless the stalemate is broken in the next few weeks , it is unlikely to complete eu membership talks by the end of the year .
but the two countries differ on the solution .
because of this issue we are now in the blockade gordan jandrokovic croatian foreign minister slovenia prefers eu mediation , possibly led by the nobel peace prize winner martti ahtisaari , the man who drew up the blueprint for kosovo 's independence .
croatia says the border dispute is a legal issue , not a political one , and should be handled by the international court of justice in the hague .
" we have one bilateral issue which is not related to our negotiation process , " croatian foreign minister gordan jandrokovic said .
" and because of this issue we are now in the blockade . "
" the message is that if we fulfil all that 's necessary for membership , if we undertake some reforms that are very painful , there is no guarantee that we will become a member of the eu , " he added .
facebook wars almost uniquely in the former yugoslavia , croatia and slovenia have never gone to war with each other .
but the border dispute has now sparked what some call the facebook wars .
the dispute has sparked ' facebook wars ' between rival lobby groups over 40,000 croats have joined a group on the social networking site calling for a boycott of slovenian products .
outside a slovenian-owned shopping mall in the croatian capital zagreb , several people said they did n't think they were getting fair treatment .
" i do not love slovenians because they always act like we are enemies , " one young mother told me .
" they are small , they have their frustration about that , they want the croatian coast , everything . "
" we could live together like good neighbours , but from the beginning , slovenians are n't acting like friends , " she said .
two hours ' drive away , in the slovenian capital ljubljana , student nejc jemec showed me a facebook group called " slovenia + croatia = best friends . "
he joined it along with thousands of others to protest against another group , " red light to croatia , " which supports the government 's tough line .
" i hope that things will get better in the future , " nejc said , " and that people will prepare not to think irrationally , but to admit that it would be probably easier for both of us if we were both members of the eu , it would be easier to solve problems . "
dangerous precedent a meeting between the prime ministers of slovenia and croatia later this month may lead to a solution .
but no date has been set .
a complicating factor is the attempt by two slovenian nationalist groups to hold a referendum on croatia 's nato accession .
they say croatia should be prevented from joining the alliance at a summit in april because of the border dispute .
a nato spokesman voiced concern at the move , which would be unprecedented .
macedonia 's hopes to join nato and the eu have also been dealt a serious blow by greece , because of a row over the country 's name , which athens believes could lead to territorial claims .
as serbia and other balkan nations line up to join the western clubs , there 's growing concern that a dangerous precedent has been set .

slovenia , the first former yugoslav nation to join the eu in 2004 , has been blocking talks with croatia because of the 18-year-old dispute , which mainly concerns a small bay in the adriatic sea .
seen from a boat , piran is a glorious sight - a venetian-style city built of limestone and marble , lapped by the blue waters of the adriatic .
it 's easily missed on a map , but this small bay of just 20 square km -lrb- eight square miles -rrb- is making big diplomatic waves .
border line the row centres on access to international waters , which slovenia treasures because its coastline is just 46km -lrb- 29 miles -rrb- long .
by contrast , croatia 's huge adriatic coast stretches for 1,700km -lrb- 1056 miles -rrb- .
however , croatia claims that the border should be drawn down the middle of the bay of piran , which slovenia fears would deny its ships direct passage to the high seas .
when both nations were part of yugoslavia , borders did n't really matter .
but since they declared independence in 1991 , incidents have flared up in the bay , with fishing boats seized and nets damaged .
" it 's a big problem , " said milenko bulezan , a fisherman for 20 years .
" if we know where the border is , we go to that line , but we do n't know now . "
" we 're afraid to go over this border , " mr bulezan said .
