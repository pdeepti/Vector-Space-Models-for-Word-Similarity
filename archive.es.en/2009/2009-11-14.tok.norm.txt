that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .

in a symbolic protest that both mourned the city 's shrinking population and demonstrated hope for the future , venetians held a mock funeral procession through venice 's trademark canals , complete with pall bearers in black capes and a flower-draped coffin .
the procession ended at city hall , where protesters read a message of condolence and a poem in the local dialect .

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "
british abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of the abuses at the abu ghraib prison caused an international outcry one claimant alleges he was raped by two british soldiers while in a detention center , while a 14-year-old boy claims he was forced to perform a sex act on a british soldier . others allege they were stripped naked , photographed and abused .
in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "
british abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of the abuses at the abu ghraib prison caused an international outcry one claimant alleges he was raped by two british soldiers while in a detention center , while a 14-year-old boy claims he was forced to perform a sex act on a british soldier . others allege they were stripped naked , photographed and abused .
in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .
an investigation is already underway into the death of an iraqi civilian , baha mousa , who died in british custody in basra in 2003 after sustaining 93 separate injuries to his body. sjt / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by concentrating its european presence in germany , gm could hope to appease politicians and auto workers angry with the automaker 's abandonment of a plan to sell its german branch opel . the small german town of ruesselsheim has not been happy with general motors .
since gm 's announcement that it would restructure german subsidiary opel itself , rather than sell it off , ruesselsheim has been home to angry protesters calling gm 's behavior " totally unacceptable " and " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism . "
in a move that may appease some of that anger , a gm spokesman announced saturday it will move its european headquarters from the swiss capital zurich to ruesselsheim , opel 's current home .
all but the headquarters of the chevrolet brand will be included in the transfer , which should be completed before the end of the year , the spokesman said .

the decision to keep the company shocked politicans and auto employees all over germany and europe .
the german government has already earmarked 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loans to aid the struggling company , but everyone from politicians , employers ' associations and german citizens have expressed opposition to further aid .

that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "
the chancellor emphasized that " self-supporting economic growth " was necessary and warned that " a lack of recovery with years of weak and unstable finances would end up being more expensive for the public purse than courageous action .

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "
the chancellor emphasized that " self-supporting economic growth " was necessary and warned that " a lack of recovery with years of weak and unstable finances would end up being more expensive for the public purse than courageous action .

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "
the chancellor emphasized that " self-supporting economic growth " was necessary and warned that " a lack of recovery with years of weak and unstable finances would end up being more expensive for the public purse than courageous action .

the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "
the chancellor emphasized that " self-supporting economic growth " was necessary and warned that " a lack of recovery with years of weak and unstable finances would end up being more expensive for the public purse than courageous action .

by concentrating its european presence in germany , gm could hope to appease politicians and auto workers angry with the automaker 's abandonment of a plan to sell its german branch opel . the small german town of ruesselsheim has not been happy with general motors .
since gm 's announcement that it would restructure german subsidiary opel itself , rather than sell it off , ruesselsheim has been home to angry protesters calling gm 's behavior " totally unacceptable " and " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism . "
in a move that may appease some of that anger , a gm spokesman announced saturday it will move its european headquarters from the swiss capital zurich to ruesselsheim , opel 's current home .
all but the headquarters of the chevrolet brand will be included in the transfer , which should be completed before the end of the year , the spokesman said .

the decision to keep the company shocked politicans and auto employees all over germany and europe .
the german government has already earmarked 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loans to aid the struggling company , but everyone from politicians , employers ' associations and german citizens have expressed opposition to further aid .
much of the anger toward gm stems from what are widely seen as inevitable layoffs during restructuring .

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "
the chancellor emphasized that " self-supporting economic growth " was necessary and warned that " a lack of recovery with years of weak and unstable finances would end up being more expensive for the public purse than courageous action .

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "
british abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of the abuses at the abu ghraib prison caused an international outcry one claimant alleges he was raped by two british soldiers while in a detention center , while a 14-year-old boy claims he was forced to perform a sex act on a british soldier . others allege they were stripped naked , photographed and abused .
in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 14.11.2009 anti-immigrant views widespread in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prejudices can be eliminated in a very simple way : friendship a new study has found that anti-foreigner sentiments are widespread in the eu , although the forms in which they appear vary from country to country .
the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .

the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.11.2009 china sees leadership role as unwanted surprise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new , powerful ' g2 ' could be emerging made up of the us and china as us president barack obama continues his week-long asia visit , europeans are paying special attention to the china leg of the trip .
that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .

by concentrating its european presence in germany , gm could hope to appease politicians and auto workers angry with the automaker 's abandonment of a plan to sell its german branch opel . the small german town of ruesselsheim has not been happy with general motors .
since gm 's announcement that it would restructure german subsidiary opel itself , rather than sell it off , ruesselsheim has been home to angry protesters calling gm 's behavior " totally unacceptable " and " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism . "
in a move that may appease some of that anger , a gm spokesman announced saturday it will move its european headquarters from the swiss capital zurich to ruesselsheim , opel 's current home .
all but the headquarters of the chevrolet brand will be included in the transfer , which should be completed before the end of the year , the spokesman said .
reneging on a deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers protested gm 's decision to keep the company gm had been through months of negotiations with the canadian firm magna on selling off opel , and german chancellor angela merkel had invested significant political capital in backing the sale .
the decision to keep the company shocked politicans and auto employees all over germany and europe .
the german government has already earmarked 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loans to aid the struggling company , but everyone from politicians , employers ' associations and german citizens have expressed opposition to further aid .
much of the anger toward gm stems from what are widely seen as inevitable layoffs during restructuring .

europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .

by concentrating its european presence in germany , gm could hope to appease politicians and auto workers angry with the automaker 's abandonment of a plan to sell its german branch opel . the small german town of ruesselsheim has not been happy with general motors .

in a symbolic protest that both mourned the city 's shrinking population and demonstrated hope for the future , venetians held a mock funeral procession through venice 's trademark canals , complete with pall bearers in black capes and a flower-draped coffin .
the procession ended at city hall , where protesters read a message of condolence and a poem in the local dialect .

several factors have contributed to the population decline , including mounting housing costs brought on by rampant tourism , rising water levels and a low birth rate .

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "
british abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of the abuses at the abu ghraib prison caused an international outcry one claimant alleges he was raped by two british soldiers while in a detention center , while a 14-year-old boy claims he was forced to perform a sex act on a british soldier . others allege they were stripped naked , photographed and abused .
in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .
an investigation is already underway into the death of an iraqi civilian , baha mousa , who died in british custody in basra in 2003 after sustaining 93 separate injuries to his body. sjt / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by concentrating its european presence in germany , gm could hope to appease politicians and auto workers angry with the automaker 's abandonment of a plan to sell its german branch opel . the small german town of ruesselsheim has not been happy with general motors .
since gm 's announcement that it would restructure german subsidiary opel itself , rather than sell it off , ruesselsheim has been home to angry protesters calling gm 's behavior " totally unacceptable " and " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism . "
in a move that may appease some of that anger , a gm spokesman announced saturday it will move its european headquarters from the swiss capital zurich to ruesselsheim , opel 's current home .
all but the headquarters of the chevrolet brand will be included in the transfer , which should be completed before the end of the year , the spokesman said .
reneging on a deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers protested gm 's decision to keep the company gm had been through months of negotiations with the canadian firm magna on selling off opel , and german chancellor angela merkel had invested significant political capital in backing the sale .
the decision to keep the company shocked politicans and auto employees all over germany and europe .
the german government has already earmarked 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loans to aid the struggling company , but everyone from politicians , employers ' associations and german citizens have expressed opposition to further aid .
much of the anger toward gm stems from what are widely seen as inevitable layoffs during restructuring .

in a symbolic protest that both mourned the city 's shrinking population and demonstrated hope for the future , venetians held a mock funeral procession through venice 's trademark canals , complete with pall bearers in black capes and a flower-draped coffin .
the procession ended at city hall , where protesters read a message of condolence and a poem in the local dialect .
despite the mournful atmosphere , organizers tried to end the action on an optimistic note .
at the climax , pallbearers smashed open the coffin to brandish a flag with an image of the phoenix , symbolizing the city 's resurrection . tourism contributes to decline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venetians fear the shrinking population could soon turn the city into a living museum the local web site venessia.com organized the protest in response to a report last month stating the city 's population had fallen below 60,000 , half of what it was in 1966 .
several factors have contributed to the population decline , including mounting housing costs brought on by rampant tourism , rising water levels and a low birth rate .
venice city officials said it was too soon to mourn the city 's death , and that the population has since risen back above 60,000 .
in addition , that number does n't include the inhabitants of venice 's islands , who together add another 120,000. acb / ap / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a symbolic protest that both mourned the city 's shrinking population and demonstrated hope for the future , venetians held a mock funeral procession through venice 's trademark canals , complete with pall bearers in black capes and a flower-draped coffin .
the procession ended at city hall , where protesters read a message of condolence and a poem in the local dialect .
despite the mournful atmosphere , organizers tried to end the action on an optimistic note .
at the climax , pallbearers smashed open the coffin to brandish a flag with an image of the phoenix , symbolizing the city 's resurrection . tourism contributes to decline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venetians fear the shrinking population could soon turn the city into a living museum the local web site venessia.com organized the protest in response to a report last month stating the city 's population had fallen below 60,000 , half of what it was in 1966 .
several factors have contributed to the population decline , including mounting housing costs brought on by rampant tourism , rising water levels and a low birth rate .
venice city officials said it was too soon to mourn the city 's death , and that the population has since risen back above 60,000 .
in addition , that number does n't include the inhabitants of venice 's islands , who together add another 120,000. acb / ap / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "
british abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of the abuses at the abu ghraib prison caused an international outcry one claimant alleges he was raped by two british soldiers while in a detention center , while a 14-year-old boy claims he was forced to perform a sex act on a british soldier . others allege they were stripped naked , photographed and abused .
in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .
an investigation is already underway into the death of an iraqi civilian , baha mousa , who died in british custody in basra in 2003 after sustaining 93 separate injuries to his body. sjt / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "
the chancellor emphasized that " self-supporting economic growth " was necessary and warned that " a lack of recovery with years of weak and unstable finances would end up being more expensive for the public purse than courageous action .

" there is no problem from the side of turkey with iran storing its low-grade uranium in turkey .
we can not say no , " energy minister taner yildiz told reporters .
tehran has been hesitant to export its uranium stockpile in exchange for more highly-enriched uranium to power a tehran medical reactor .
in response , the iaea suggested keeping it in a friendly third country , like turkey , while waiting for the fuel .
turkey is both a nato member and a friend to iran , and has said it would also be willing to mediate discussions between iran and the west over iran 's nuclear program .

western powers supported the plan as a way for iran to prove its nuclear program is peaceful , as it has repeatedly insisted .
tehran has not officially accepted or rejected the proposal , but instead responded with calls for amendments and further negotiations , which the united states has rejected. acb / afp / ap / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "
british abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of the abuses at the abu ghraib prison caused an international outcry one claimant alleges he was raped by two british soldiers while in a detention center , while a 14-year-old boy claims he was forced to perform a sex act on a british soldier . others allege they were stripped naked , photographed and abused .
in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .
an investigation is already underway into the death of an iraqi civilian , baha mousa , who died in british custody in basra in 2003 after sustaining 93 separate injuries to his body. sjt / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 14.11.2009 anti-immigrant views widespread in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prejudices can be eliminated in a very simple way : friendship a new study has found that anti-foreigner sentiments are widespread in the eu , although the forms in which they appear vary from country to country .
the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "
british abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of the abuses at the abu ghraib prison caused an international outcry one claimant alleges he was raped by two british soldiers while in a detention center , while a 14-year-old boy claims he was forced to perform a sex act on a british soldier . others allege they were stripped naked , photographed and abused .
in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .
an investigation is already underway into the death of an iraqi civilian , baha mousa , who died in british custody in basra in 2003 after sustaining 93 separate injuries to his body. sjt / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no problem from the side of turkey with iran storing its low-grade uranium in turkey .
we can not say no , " energy minister taner yildiz told reporters .
tehran has been hesitant to export its uranium stockpile in exchange for more highly-enriched uranium to power a tehran medical reactor .
in response , the iaea suggested keeping it in a friendly third country , like turkey , while waiting for the fuel .
turkey is both a nato member and a friend to iran , and has said it would also be willing to mediate discussions between iran and the west over iran 's nuclear program .
original nuclear proposal going stale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west fears iran is building up its uranium stockpile to build a nuclear bomb the iaea presented a plan to iran on october 21 which would have them export 70 percent of their low-enriched uranium to russia and france for further enrichment before returning it to tehran .
western powers supported the plan as a way for iran to prove its nuclear program is peaceful , as it has repeatedly insisted .
tehran has not officially accepted or rejected the proposal , but instead responded with calls for amendments and further negotiations , which the united states has rejected. acb / afp / ap / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de iran responds with counterproposal to iaea plan iran has welcomed the proposal by the un 's nuclear watchdog to enrich its uranium abroad , but it has further delayed giving a clear response on whether it will accept the deal .

the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

in a symbolic protest that both mourned the city 's shrinking population and demonstrated hope for the future , venetians held a mock funeral procession through venice 's trademark canals , complete with pall bearers in black capes and a flower-draped coffin .
the procession ended at city hall , where protesters read a message of condolence and a poem in the local dialect .
despite the mournful atmosphere , organizers tried to end the action on an optimistic note .
at the climax , pallbearers smashed open the coffin to brandish a flag with an image of the phoenix , symbolizing the city 's resurrection . tourism contributes to decline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venetians fear the shrinking population could soon turn the city into a living museum the local web site venessia.com organized the protest in response to a report last month stating the city 's population had fallen below 60,000 , half of what it was in 1966 .
several factors have contributed to the population decline , including mounting housing costs brought on by rampant tourism , rising water levels and a low birth rate .
venice city officials said it was too soon to mourn the city 's death , and that the population has since risen back above 60,000 .
in addition , that number does n't include the inhabitants of venice 's islands , who together add another 120,000. acb / ap / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "
the chancellor emphasized that " self-supporting economic growth " was necessary and warned that " a lack of recovery with years of weak and unstable finances would end up being more expensive for the public purse than courageous action .

the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

" there is no problem from the side of turkey with iran storing its low-grade uranium in turkey .
we can not say no , " energy minister taner yildiz told reporters .
tehran has been hesitant to export its uranium stockpile in exchange for more highly-enriched uranium to power a tehran medical reactor .
in response , the iaea suggested keeping it in a friendly third country , like turkey , while waiting for the fuel .
turkey is both a nato member and a friend to iran , and has said it would also be willing to mediate discussions between iran and the west over iran 's nuclear program .
original nuclear proposal going stale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west fears iran is building up its uranium stockpile to build a nuclear bomb the iaea presented a plan to iran on october 21 which would have them export 70 percent of their low-enriched uranium to russia and france for further enrichment before returning it to tehran .
western powers supported the plan as a way for iran to prove its nuclear program is peaceful , as it has repeatedly insisted .
tehran has not officially accepted or rejected the proposal , but instead responded with calls for amendments and further negotiations , which the united states has rejected. acb / afp / ap / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 29.10.2009 -rrb- which way will turkey turn , east or west ?
turkey makes no bones about its aspirations to act as a bridge between east and west , but a string of recent events have left the west wondering how stable any such construction might be .

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "
british abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of the abuses at the abu ghraib prison caused an international outcry one claimant alleges he was raped by two british soldiers while in a detention center , while a 14-year-old boy claims he was forced to perform a sex act on a british soldier . others allege they were stripped naked , photographed and abused .
in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .
an investigation is already underway into the death of an iraqi civilian , baha mousa , who died in british custody in basra in 2003 after sustaining 93 separate injuries to his body. sjt / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by concentrating its european presence in germany , gm could hope to appease politicians and auto workers angry with the automaker 's abandonment of a plan to sell its german branch opel . the small german town of ruesselsheim has not been happy with general motors .
since gm 's announcement that it would restructure german subsidiary opel itself , rather than sell it off , ruesselsheim has been home to angry protesters calling gm 's behavior " totally unacceptable " and " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism . "
in a move that may appease some of that anger , a gm spokesman announced saturday it will move its european headquarters from the swiss capital zurich to ruesselsheim , opel 's current home .
all but the headquarters of the chevrolet brand will be included in the transfer , which should be completed before the end of the year , the spokesman said .
reneging on a deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers protested gm 's decision to keep the company gm had been through months of negotiations with the canadian firm magna on selling off opel , and german chancellor angela merkel had invested significant political capital in backing the sale .
the decision to keep the company shocked politicans and auto employees all over germany and europe .
the german government has already earmarked 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loans to aid the struggling company , but everyone from politicians , employers ' associations and german citizens have expressed opposition to further aid .
much of the anger toward gm stems from what are widely seen as inevitable layoffs during restructuring .

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "
the chancellor emphasized that " self-supporting economic growth " was necessary and warned that " a lack of recovery with years of weak and unstable finances would end up being more expensive for the public purse than courageous action .

by concentrating its european presence in germany , gm could hope to appease politicians and auto workers angry with the automaker 's abandonment of a plan to sell its german branch opel . the small german town of ruesselsheim has not been happy with general motors .
since gm 's announcement that it would restructure german subsidiary opel itself , rather than sell it off , ruesselsheim has been home to angry protesters calling gm 's behavior " totally unacceptable " and " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism . "
in a move that may appease some of that anger , a gm spokesman announced saturday it will move its european headquarters from the swiss capital zurich to ruesselsheim , opel 's current home .
all but the headquarters of the chevrolet brand will be included in the transfer , which should be completed before the end of the year , the spokesman said .
reneging on a deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers protested gm 's decision to keep the company gm had been through months of negotiations with the canadian firm magna on selling off opel , and german chancellor angela merkel had invested significant political capital in backing the sale .
the decision to keep the company shocked politicans and auto employees all over germany and europe .
the german government has already earmarked 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loans to aid the struggling company , but everyone from politicians , employers ' associations and german citizens have expressed opposition to further aid .
much of the anger toward gm stems from what are widely seen as inevitable layoffs during restructuring .

that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?

bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "

in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .

by concentrating its european presence in germany , gm could hope to appease politicians and auto workers angry with the automaker 's abandonment of a plan to sell its german branch opel . the small german town of ruesselsheim has not been happy with general motors .
since gm 's announcement that it would restructure german subsidiary opel itself , rather than sell it off , ruesselsheim has been home to angry protesters calling gm 's behavior " totally unacceptable " and " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism . "
in a move that may appease some of that anger , a gm spokesman announced saturday it will move its european headquarters from the swiss capital zurich to ruesselsheim , opel 's current home .
all but the headquarters of the chevrolet brand will be included in the transfer , which should be completed before the end of the year , the spokesman said .

the decision to keep the company shocked politicans and auto employees all over germany and europe .
the german government has already earmarked 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loans to aid the struggling company , but everyone from politicians , employers ' associations and german citizens have expressed opposition to further aid .

by concentrating its european presence in germany , gm could hope to appease politicians and auto workers angry with the automaker 's abandonment of a plan to sell its german branch opel . the small german town of ruesselsheim has not been happy with general motors .
since gm 's announcement that it would restructure german subsidiary opel itself , rather than sell it off , ruesselsheim has been home to angry protesters calling gm 's behavior " totally unacceptable " and " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism . "
in a move that may appease some of that anger , a gm spokesman announced saturday it will move its european headquarters from the swiss capital zurich to ruesselsheim , opel 's current home .
all but the headquarters of the chevrolet brand will be included in the transfer , which should be completed before the end of the year , the spokesman said .
reneging on a deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers protested gm 's decision to keep the company gm had been through months of negotiations with the canadian firm magna on selling off opel , and german chancellor angela merkel had invested significant political capital in backing the sale .
the decision to keep the company shocked politicans and auto employees all over germany and europe .
the german government has already earmarked 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loans to aid the struggling company , but everyone from politicians , employers ' associations and german citizens have expressed opposition to further aid .
much of the anger toward gm stems from what are widely seen as inevitable layoffs during restructuring .

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .

in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .

the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.11.2009 china sees leadership role as unwanted surprise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new , powerful ' g2 ' could be emerging made up of the us and china as us president barack obama continues his week-long asia visit , europeans are paying special attention to the china leg of the trip .
that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "
the chancellor emphasized that " self-supporting economic growth " was necessary and warned that " a lack of recovery with years of weak and unstable finances would end up being more expensive for the public purse than courageous action .

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "
british abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of the abuses at the abu ghraib prison caused an international outcry one claimant alleges he was raped by two british soldiers while in a detention center , while a 14-year-old boy claims he was forced to perform a sex act on a british soldier . others allege they were stripped naked , photographed and abused .
in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .
an investigation is already underway into the death of an iraqi civilian , baha mousa , who died in british custody in basra in 2003 after sustaining 93 separate injuries to his body. sjt / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "
british abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of the abuses at the abu ghraib prison caused an international outcry one claimant alleges he was raped by two british soldiers while in a detention center , while a 14-year-old boy claims he was forced to perform a sex act on a british soldier . others allege they were stripped naked , photographed and abused .
in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .
an investigation is already underway into the death of an iraqi civilian , baha mousa , who died in british custody in basra in 2003 after sustaining 93 separate injuries to his body. sjt / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "
british abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of the abuses at the abu ghraib prison caused an international outcry one claimant alleges he was raped by two british soldiers while in a detention center , while a 14-year-old boy claims he was forced to perform a sex act on a british soldier . others allege they were stripped naked , photographed and abused .
in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .

by concentrating its european presence in germany , gm could hope to appease politicians and auto workers angry with the automaker 's abandonment of a plan to sell its german branch opel . the small german town of ruesselsheim has not been happy with general motors .
since gm 's announcement that it would restructure german subsidiary opel itself , rather than sell it off , ruesselsheim has been home to angry protesters calling gm 's behavior " totally unacceptable " and " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism . "
in a move that may appease some of that anger , a gm spokesman announced saturday it will move its european headquarters from the swiss capital zurich to ruesselsheim , opel 's current home .
all but the headquarters of the chevrolet brand will be included in the transfer , which should be completed before the end of the year , the spokesman said .

the decision to keep the company shocked politicans and auto employees all over germany and europe .
the german government has already earmarked 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loans to aid the struggling company , but everyone from politicians , employers ' associations and german citizens have expressed opposition to further aid .

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "
the chancellor emphasized that " self-supporting economic growth " was necessary and warned that " a lack of recovery with years of weak and unstable finances would end up being more expensive for the public purse than courageous action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 14.11.2009 anti-immigrant views widespread in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prejudices can be eliminated in a very simple way : friendship a new study has found that anti-foreigner sentiments are widespread in the eu , although the forms in which they appear vary from country to country .
the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .

the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .

the best way to get rid of them ?
friendship , researchers say . one in two europeans believes there are too many immigrants in europe .
but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "
the chancellor emphasized that " self-supporting economic growth " was necessary and warned that " a lack of recovery with years of weak and unstable finances would end up being more expensive for the public purse than courageous action .

but if you look more closely , it is clear that opinions vary broadly across the continent .
in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

in italy , 62 percent of respondents agree there are too many immigrants , while in poland , which has very few foreigners , only 27 percent think so .
but when it comes to jobs , three in four poles say those born in the country should be given preferential treatment .
another , seemingly contradictory , example from the study comes from the netherlands .
the dutch are tolerant when it comes to jobs - only one in four of the 8,000 respondents think natives should be favored over immigrants .
but on the other hand , they are the least willing to invest in neighborhoods inhabited by immigrants .
friendship as a way to understanding prejudices such as those prevalent in the eu can be eliminated in a simple way , according to the study , which was conducted by researchers from eight countries .
people from different groups must simply come in contact with one another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 31 percent of muslims feel discriminated against in europe , according to polls " we have clearly figured out by research over the past ten years that friendships are most effective .
if i myself have a friend in another group , that is the best scenario .
but when i see that a friend of mine has a friend in another group , that is also very effective , " said miles hewstone of oxford university .
while that may sound rather simple , there are still many obstacles to making it happen in reality , says anetta kahane of the amadeu antonio foundation in berlin .
the organization , which contributed funding to the study , says right-wing violence and racism in the east of germany and europe is widespread .
and it is difficult to bring different groups together in places where there is a low immigrant population , said kahane .
still a lot of work to be done but having contact with people of another background is not sufficient , said cem oezdemir , head of germany 's green party .
" if simply having encounters and friendships with people of different groups were enough to get rid of racism and prejudices , then we should actually be the country where there are no problems , when i think of the many travelers to turkey and to other countries , " he said .
however , the study says encounters form the basis on which greater understanding can develop .
the study also found that discrimination was strongest in poland and hungary .
so the west can not just sit back , says oezdemir .
" about 200 years after the age of enlightenment , we have still not reached the highest stage of human civilization .
barbarism is all around us .
it exists in the european union , " oezdemir said .
however , he views the role of the eu positively .
he says it has made substantial progress on the issue of discrimination , for example , by implementing anti-discrimination directives , which many individual countries had long refused .
it is at least on the right track .

the british ministry of defence says it is taking claims of torture against detainees in iraq very seriously .
detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .
the allegations arose after british daily newspaper , the independent , published an article in which a lawyer acting for detainees cataloged more than 30 new cases of abuse , inlcuding rape and torture .
female soldiers were accused in the article of aiding in the physical and sexual abuse of prisoners .
the claims were being taken seriously , according to minister for the armed forces william rammell .
in a statement rammell said formal investigations needed to take place " without judgements being made prematurely . "
british abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of the abuses at the abu ghraib prison caused an international outcry one claimant alleges he was raped by two british soldiers while in a detention center , while a 14-year-old boy claims he was forced to perform a sex act on a british soldier . others allege they were stripped naked , photographed and abused .
in another incident described in the article , detainees were piled atop each other and electrocuted .
the allegations of abuse are being compared to the treatment of prisoners in the abu ghraib where a similar scandal broke in an american-run prison in 2004 .
an investigation is already underway into the death of an iraqi civilian , baha mousa , who died in british custody in basra in 2003 after sustaining 93 separate injuries to his body. sjt / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

detainees claim they were raped and tortured by british soldiers . the british ministry of defence announced on saturday that it is investigating allegations of abuse against prisoners of war in iraq .

by concentrating its european presence in germany , gm could hope to appease politicians and auto workers angry with the automaker 's abandonment of a plan to sell its german branch opel . the small german town of ruesselsheim has not been happy with general motors .
since gm 's announcement that it would restructure german subsidiary opel itself , rather than sell it off , ruesselsheim has been home to angry protesters calling gm 's behavior " totally unacceptable " and " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism . "

the plan to spend germany out of its economic slump would further add to the country 's burgeoning debt for years to come and contravene the european union 's debt ceiling rules .
a panel of economic experts on friday issued a stinging critique of the chancellor 's plans , calling them " vague " and " deceptive " .
the group of so-called " five wise men " said merkel failed to recognize the scale of the challenges facing europe 's largest economy .
the group of independent academics which advises the german government and parliament on economic policy issues said the new coalition had not spelled out how it will reduce germany 's budget deficit and the massive stimulus measures propping up the economy . spending cuts would worsen the crisis , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower taxes mean more growth , merkel argues the chancellor countered , however , saying that " of course it is right to consolidate public spending , but if we start doing that at the bottom of the economic crisis we will only be making the crisis worse . "
export dependent germany has been hit hard by the global recession , but is already beginning to recover .
the merkel government argues that lower taxes , coupled with continued public spending , will kick-start the economy and lead to higher tax revenues as business expands and more jobs are created .
economics minister rainer bruederle sharply rebuked the economists for their objections , saying " professors can not replace the reasoning of political leaders .
that 's why they are advisers and not decision-makers . "
merkel said she was " aware that her strategy carried risks , but that the decision was reached after thoroughly considering all the pros and cons . "
the chancellor emphasized that " self-supporting economic growth " was necessary and warned that " a lack of recovery with years of weak and unstable finances would end up being more expensive for the public purse than courageous action .

the fao has called the november 16-18 meeting hoping to win a clear pledge from world leaders to spend $ 44 billion -lrb- € 29.7 million -rrb- a year to help poor countries develop self-sufficiency in food production .
ban ki-moon will be traveling from new york to rome where he will be speaking at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban urges help for the one billion people who go hungry " the secretary-general intends to join the fast over the weekend , " said un spokeswoman marie okabe .
he will be fasting in transit , she said .
at the summit , okabe said ban would " highlight the human cost of the recent food , energy and economic crises " on the world 's poor and underscore the link between climate change and food security .
meanwhile , the un 's world food program , facing a major shortfall in funding , is launching a new drive for donations before the food summit convenes .
josette sheeran , head of the food aid body , said the wfp is starting an internet appeal this saturday to get one million people in the developed world to donate just one euro -lrb- $ 1.48 -rrb- a week to the campaign .
sheeran said her organization was only on track to raise about half the $ 6.7 billion -lrb- € 4.5 billion -rrb- it had targeted for the year , but that the one-euro campaign could cover the shortfall. gb / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.11.2009 china sees leadership role as unwanted surprise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new , powerful ' g2 ' could be emerging made up of the us and china as us president barack obama continues his week-long asia visit , europeans are paying special attention to the china leg of the trip .
that nation 's influence continues to grow along with its economy . deutsche welle spoke to bernt berger , an analyst for chinese foreign and security policy issues at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
he explains why china is less than comfortable with its world leadership role .
deutsche welle : obama is currently in asia - and all eyes are on his stop in china .
what are the expectations for the meeting , in terms of outcome ?
bernt berger : well , its too early to see what will come out of obama 's new asia policy , or what he calls the " new era of engagement " in general .
i think the visit that is starting now is more symbolic .
obama will go to china and set the tone for the relationship in the future .
the real negotiations , especially with china , take place in the china strategic and economic dialog , where real issues are being talked about , like protectionism , human rights , or exchange-rate issues .
does europe , or the eu , have any particular expectations for obama 's visit to china ?
the eu does n't have the same role that the us does in the asian region - we 're not engaged in security issues in east asia , we 're not a regional power .
but the us has this role - of ordering power in the region , and as a balance of china in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where real work gets done : the china strategic and economic dialog so far , china is a very weak military power , but they are a very strong economic power , and they are in dialog with most of the states on a multilateral and bilateral basis .
the us will now engage more in this kind of forum .
for instance there will be the us-asean summit where the us will try to engage with southeast asian nations on a different basis than they have so far .
do you think the eu is content with its role when it comes to us-asian relations ?
or were they hoping that with this new us administration they could be more central to policy discussions ?
i think you have to separate the issues .
the eu has its own relationship with asean … and i think the us has a completely different role in asia .
there is no direct competition , and no direct benefit for europeans from these meetings .
the problem for the us at the moment is that none of the main foreign policy objectives in the world right now can be solved without china .
that concerns the international financial crisis , north korea , iran , and economic problems in general .
so the us and china have to get to the table and sort these problems out together .
so does this support what a lot of commentators are saying : that in terms of world influence , china is more or less on par with the us ?
the catchphrase is that there is a ' g2 ' emerging at the heart of the g20 .
as far as the idea of a g2 is concerned , the chinese have n't been very happy about this term so far .
they do n't want to be seen as one of the two great powers - it would damage their image in the developing world .
the problem is that smaller states in the developing world are trying to diversify their relations , and in order to gain political weight , both the us and china have to be on board .
but is n't it china 's goal to be a world power ?
or is the issue simply that beijing would rather not be portrayed that way ?
actually , it 's not really their goal .
i think sometimes the chinese themselves are surprised by the dynamic that happened with their rise .
it was n't their goal to become a great power , its just a side effect of their economic development so far .
what kind of issues will europe keep an eye on in these meetings ?
security issues , for one .
there are several trends taking place .
in the run-up to these meetings between obama and china , there were initiatives on the side of japan and australia , who had a kind of alliance with india since -lrb- former us president george w. -rrb-
bush was in office , to be a balance against china .
now this has changed , since the obama administration came in , and also because the taiwan issue is less problematic since relations between taiwan and the mainland have improved over the last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernt berger but there were initiatives from australia , first of all to give more weight to apec , where china is not a member , and secondly to bring the us into the east asian forums , especially to the east asian summit , which includes the asean countries , china , japan , australia , india … . we do n't know what will come out of this yet .
but these are some initiatives which try to prevent the us-china relationship from becoming too strong .
europeans generally seem to be in love with obama and are very positive on his leadership style and policies so far .
do the chinese feel the same , or are they more sceptical ?
obama is very popular among the chinese public .
i think they are expecting him to bring another change into the diplomatic tone between china and the us , and increase the dialogical character of the relationships .
i have to say that relations were n't bad between the bush administration and china - they were very uncontroversial .
but the chinese of course expect that dialog will be improved and that critical issues will be talked about in a constructive manner with obama .
this includes things like human rights and tibet .
speaking of which , human rights issues seem to be pretty far from the center of the discussion of this trip .
why is that ?
i think obama has kept a low profile on this issue .
it does n't mean he does n't talk about it .
he will have a very specific style when visiting china this time . but i do n't think he will meet with dissidents , because that would have a negative impact .

by concentrating its european presence in germany , gm could hope to appease politicians and auto workers angry with the automaker 's abandonment of a plan to sell its german branch opel . the small german town of ruesselsheim has not been happy with general motors .
since gm 's announcement that it would restructure german subsidiary opel itself , rather than sell it off , ruesselsheim has been home to angry protesters calling gm 's behavior " totally unacceptable " and " the ugly face of turbo-capitalism . "
in a move that may appease some of that anger , a gm spokesman announced saturday it will move its european headquarters from the swiss capital zurich to ruesselsheim , opel 's current home .
all but the headquarters of the chevrolet brand will be included in the transfer , which should be completed before the end of the year , the spokesman said .
reneging on a deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of opel workers protested gm 's decision to keep the company gm had been through months of negotiations with the canadian firm magna on selling off opel , and german chancellor angela merkel had invested significant political capital in backing the sale .
the decision to keep the company shocked politicans and auto employees all over germany and europe .
the german government has already earmarked 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loans to aid the struggling company , but everyone from politicians , employers ' associations and german citizens have expressed opposition to further aid .
much of the anger toward gm stems from what are widely seen as inevitable layoffs during restructuring .

many in the crowd began to laugh during the anthem , which incorporates five of south africa 's 11 official languages .
making matters worse , the world champs went on to lose 20-13 to france .
south african coach peter de villiers told reporters the french deserved to win , but added that he was very angry with the hosts for the poor singing of the anthem .
" before i answer the first question , i must first convey that we were annoyed by the fact the french did not respect our anthem .
they did not really get somebody who knows it , " he said .
south africa forward victor matfield said the players were so shocked by the anthem blunder , they lost concentration before the match .
" it was a joke out there and the guys could n't even sing -lrb- along -rrb- and even the crowd was starting to laugh , " he said .

iran is under international pressure to accept a deal to send its enriched uranium abroad for reprocessing .
it has so far refused offers by france and russia to do this and insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful .
but the us and europe say the amounts of uranium iran is enriching could be used to build a nuclear bomb .
the speed with which fences have been mended between iran and turkey in recent months has caused some unease among turkey 's traditional allies in the west .
rising power and the open display of warmth between president mahmoud ahmadinejad and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan during their meeting in tehran last month may have caused a few missed heartbeats in washington .
but could this new axis serve a purpose ?
turkey prides itself on being a rising regional power , and a potential mediator in the middle east .
suddenly it is being talked about as a solution to the deadlock between iran and the un security council over iran 's nuclear programme .
q & a : iran and the nuclear issue guide : nuclear fuel cycle iran has so far been lukewarm towards a proposal , made last month after six-party talks in geneva , that it hand over its enriched uranium to russia for eventual reprocessing in france .
now its neighbour turkey - which has a predominantly muslim population - is offering to store the fuel for iran .
the two countries discussed the idea at an islamic summit on monday , and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has taken it up too .
turkey has no nuclear programme of its own and repeated attempts to build one have been still-born .
but the iaea says the enriched uranium produced by iran - the source of so much anxiety over potential nuclear weapons - is actually quite simple to handle .
turkey could quickly build such a facility and all that would be required would be iaea monitoring of the stock .
if this deal takes off , turkey will already have proved the worth of its policy of " zero problems " with its neighbours .
it would also help quiet those critics who believe that turkey 's shift eastwards must inevitably mean a loss for the west .

dr toby ord , 30 , who researches ethics , believes his donations to charities in developing countries could save 500,000 years of healthy life .
he is launching a society to encourage others to follow his example .
giving what we can wants others to pledge at least 10 % of their earnings to help tackle poverty in the world .
the first to join has been his wife .
dr ord will give up 10 % of his annual salary , plus any yearly earnings above £ 20,000 for the rest of his career .
" i was living very happily as a student and worked out what i 'd need to continue living like that through my life - or a little bit better , to allow some room for improvement - and then i worked out how much i could do with that amount of money .
" i could save thousands of people 's lives , and saving one person 's life is often thought to be an amazing kind of thing you can do over your whole career , " he said .
sacrifice ' extras ' he said he had been thinking for a while about how he could make a difference in the world .
he has predicted he should be able to earn about £ 1.5m over the course of his academic career , and has decided to donate about £ 1m of it to charities fighting poverty in the developing world .

the territory immediately won recognition from the united states and major european union countries .
but serbia , with the help of its big-power ally russia , has vowed to block kosovo from getting a united nations seat .
kosovo has been the backdrop to a centuries-old and often-strained relationship between its serb and ethnic albanian inhabitants .
from 1999 to 2008 the province was administered by the un , after enduring a conflict fuelled by ethnic division and repression .
reconciliation between the majority ethnic albanians , most of whom support independence , and the serb minority remains elusive .
overview overview facts leaders media the landlocked region is one of europe 's poorest , with more than half of its people living in poverty .
although it possesses rich mineral resources , agriculture is the main economic activity .
kosovo 's economy revolves around agriculture ethnic albanians number about 2 million - about 90 % of the population .
some 100,000 serbs remain following a post-war exodus of non-albanians .
the serbian minority live in separate areas watched over by nato peacekeepers .
international diplomats have voiced concern over slow progress on their rights .
history slavic and albanian peoples have co-existed in kosovo since the eighth century .
the region was the centre of the serbian empire until the mid-14th century , and serbians regard kosovo as the birthplace of their state .
over the centuries , as the ethnic balance shifted in favour of albanians , kosovo came to represent a serbian golden age , embodied in epic poetry .
serbia 's defeat at the battle of kosovo in 1389 ushered in centuries of rule under the muslim ottoman empire .
serbia regained control of kosovo in 1913 , and the province was incorporated into the yugoslav federation .
path to autonomy serbs and ethnic albanians vied for control in the region throughout the 20th century .
in the 1960s the suppression of albanian national identity in kosovo gave way to a more tolerant line from belgrade .
ethnic albanians gained a foothold in the kosovan , and yugoslav , administrations .
divided town : mitrovica has been a flashpoint for inter-ethnic tensions the 1974 yugoslav constitution laid down kosovo 's status as an autonomous province , and pressure for independence mounted in the 1980s after the death of yugoslav president tito .
but resentment over kosovan influence within the yugoslav federation was harnessed by the future leader , slobodan milosevic .
on becoming president in 1989 he proceeded to strip kosovo of its autonomy .
a passive resistance movement in the 1990s failed to secure independence or to restore autonomy , although ethnic albanian leaders declared unilateral independence in 1991 .
in the mid-1990s an ethnic albanian guerrilla movement , the kosovo liberation army , stepped up its attacks on serb targets .
the attacks precipitated a major , and brutal , yugoslav military crackdown .
war slobodan milosevic 's rejection of an internationally-brokered deal to end the crisis , and the persecution of kosovo albanians , led to the start of nato air strikes against targets in kosovo and serbia in march 1999 .
meanwhile , a campaign of ethnic cleansing against kosovo albanians was initiated by serbian forces .
hundreds of thousands of refugees fled to albania , macedonia and montenegro .
thousands of people died in the conflict .
serbian forces were driven out in the summer of 1999 and the un took over the administration of the province .

the leader of kosovo 's biggest party , the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- , he was the sole candidate .
fatmir sejdiu supports independence from serbia he was a close ally of the former president , writer-turned-politician ibrahim rugova , who died of cancer just days before un-mediated talks on kosovo 's future status began in february 2006 .
ibrahim rugova was nicknamed the " gandhi of the balkans " .
he led an ethnic albanian campaign of passive resistance against serb rule in the 1990s .
he was twice elected president in unofficial elections , and won official presidential elections in 2002 .
like his predecessor , president sejdiu supports independence for kosovo .
he was born near the town of podujevo in northern kosovo .
he studied law in france and the us and speaks both english and french .
prime minister : hashim thaci hashim thaci is a veteran of the ethnic albanians ' drive to break away from serbia .
the former guerrilla is now regarded as a moderate politician he began agitating for the kosovo albanian cause while still in his teens , and first came to prominence as the political leader of the kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- , the guerrilla group that took up arms against serb forces in the late 1990s .
he became known outside kosovo when he formed part of the kosovo albanian negotiating team at internationally-sponsored peace talks at rambouillet , france , early in 1999 .
he made such a powerful impression at the talks that he succeeded in sidelining veteran kosovo albanian leader ibrahim rugova - who was more in favour of passive resistance to serbia - and was appointed leader of the kosovo albanian negotiating team .
after the talks broke down and nato launched its air campaign against serbia that resulted in kosovo becoming a un protectorate , mr rugova reasserted his authority within the province and officially became president in 2002 .
meanwhile , mr thaci underwent a gradual process of transformation from fiery left-wing guerrilla to respectable politician .
his democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- emerged out of the kla and finally won an election in november 2007 .
some analysts believe that the years spent by mr thaci as prime minister-in-waiting allowed him to hone his political skills and made him into one of the province 's most moderate leaders .
on being elected prime minister , he made an attempt to reach out to kosovo 's dwindling serbian minority by switching to speaking serbian as he called on the serbs to consider kosovo their home .
hasim thaci was born in 1968 in the drenica region , a stronghold of the ethnic albanian revolt against serbia .
he was a student activist in 1989-91 , and later went underground to join the kla , which was formed in 1993 .
it was at that time that he acquired the nom de guerre of " the snake " on account of his success in evading capture .
he is married , with one son .

the climate is harsh and the area is isolated .
there are no roads and sanitation is basic .
that is why the one hospital in the region , the kunde hospital , is vitally important .
set up in 1966 by sir edmund hillary in the mountain town of kunde at a height of 3,840m , the hospital is mainly funded by foreign donations .
but for the past 10 years , it has been staffed and run totally by local sherpas .
dr tsering wangdi sherpa , 27 , is currently running the clinic , which serves 8,000 patients from the four main valleys of the khumbu district .
" it 's very important to have this hospital , " he says .
" before it was built , the health system here was absolutely bad .
there were a lot of problems with birth control and immunisation .
people had very bad infections and the hygiene was really bad , " he says .
' unusual ' dr tsering has only been working at kunde hospital for the last seven months .
but he has been connected to the clinic all his life .
he was born here in 1983 - delivered by a canadian doctor who was volunteering at the time .
his father used to work as a health assistant to the foreign doctors , but thanks to a grant from the sir edmund hillary foundation of canada , he was able to complete his own medical degree and became the first sherpa doctor to work at kunde .
" it was pretty unusual for my father to become a doctor , " says dr tsering .
" it was very expensive to afford the training .
the sherpas live around khumbu region which at the time was not very well-developed and most people did not have the money to afford good schools and colleges . "
dr tsering 's own training was also funded by the sir edmund hillary foundation .
he describes the new zealand mountaineer as a " godfather " to the sherpa people for building the hospital and helping the local community .
dr tsering works six days a week , running the 12-bed clinic from nine to five most days .
the small stone hospital , built on the side of a mountain with a view of the snow-capped mountains , is able to deal with minor surgeries and has a laboratory to conduct basic tests .
on the morning of my visit , dr tsering 's first patient is a man with an ingrown toenail .
he arrived at the clinic late last night and dr tsering performed basic surgery on him , removing the nail and cleaning the wound .
this morning he changes the dressing and checks for infection .
' important ' his next patients are both women who have come for their three-monthly contraceptive injection .
" the family planning service has been really important in improving the health of the people and encouraging them to have smaller families , " says dr tsering .
one of the women has walked two-and-a-half hours to reach the clinic - nothing unusual for many patients in this region .
if the hospital did not exist , she would not know where to go for contraception , she said .
the clinic charges a basic fee of 20 nepali rupees -lrb- around 25 cents -rrb- per visit - whatever service is being provided .
the fee has stayed the same for the last 20 years and dr tsering says that it means that everyone can afford treatment .
one important area in which the clinic has improved health is by providing regular iodine injections to the local population .
" thyroidism was a big problem 40 years back because there was no iodine in the region , so we had many cases of goitre and cretinism , " says dr tsering .
" but after sir edmund hillary set up the hospital we no longer have this problem , " he says .
break but as the khumbu district has become more affluent , the hospital is now dealing with different diseases .
" we 've seen an increase in diabetes in those villages that are economically better , " says the doctor .
" their diet is getting worse and they have a more sedentary lifestyle because they have people working for them . "
as morning clinic ends , dr tsering and his colleagues take a break to drink hot sweet tea and eat freshly-baked bread .
sitting in front of the hospital , the view is spectacular .
the snow-covered peak of ama dablam dominates the skyline .
the sound of lamas chanting drifts down from a buddhist monastery high above them on the mountainside .
" it 's been really great working up here , " says dr tsering .
" sometimes it 's difficult because everything is in our hands .
when things get complicated , we have to use all our knowledge and all the equipment we have to help the patient . "
" but otherwise it 's really peaceful working here , " he says .

the climate is harsh and the area is isolated .
there are no roads and sanitation is basic .
that is why the one hospital in the region , the kunde hospital , is vitally important .
set up in 1966 by sir edmund hillary in the mountain town of kunde at a height of 3,840m , the hospital is mainly funded by foreign donations .
but for the past 10 years , it has been staffed and run totally by local sherpas .
dr tsering wangdi sherpa , 27 , is currently running the clinic , which serves 8,000 patients from the four main valleys of the khumbu district .
" it 's very important to have this hospital , " he says .
" before it was built , the health system here was absolutely bad .
there were a lot of problems with birth control and immunisation .
people had very bad infections and the hygiene was really bad , " he says .
' unusual ' dr tsering has only been working at kunde hospital for the last seven months .
but he has been connected to the clinic all his life .
he was born here in 1983 - delivered by a canadian doctor who was volunteering at the time .
his father used to work as a health assistant to the foreign doctors , but thanks to a grant from the sir edmund hillary foundation of canada , he was able to complete his own medical degree and became the first sherpa doctor to work at kunde .
dr tsering has been connected to the hospital all his life " it was pretty unusual for my father to become a doctor , " says dr tsering .
" it was very expensive to afford the training .
the sherpas live around khumbu region which at the time was not very well-developed and most people did not have the money to afford good schools and colleges . "
dr tsering 's own training was also funded by the sir edmund hillary foundation .
he describes the new zealand mountaineer as a " godfather " to the sherpa people for building the hospital and helping the local community .
dr tsering works six days a week , running the 12-bed clinic from nine to five most days .
the small stone hospital , built on the side of a mountain with a view of the snow-capped mountains , is able to deal with minor surgeries and has a laboratory to conduct basic tests .
on the morning of my visit , dr tsering 's first patient is a man with an ingrown toenail .
he arrived at the clinic late last night and dr tsering performed basic surgery on him , removing the nail and cleaning the wound .
this morning he changes the dressing and checks for infection .
' important ' his next patients are both women who have come for their three-monthly contraceptive injection .
" the family planning service has been really important in improving the health of the people and encouraging them to have smaller families , " says dr tsering .
his patients come from far and wide one of the women has walked two-and-a-half hours to reach the clinic - nothing unusual for many patients in this region .
if the hospital did not exist , she would not know where to go for contraception , she said .
the clinic charges a basic fee of 20 nepali rupees -lrb- around 25 cents -rrb- per visit - whatever service is being provided .

the climate is harsh and the area is isolated .
there are no roads and sanitation is basic .
that is why the one hospital in the region , the kunde hospital , is vitally important .
set up in 1966 by sir edmund hillary in the mountain town of kunde at a height of 3,840m , the hospital is mainly funded by foreign donations .
but for the past 10 years , it has been staffed and run totally by local sherpas .
dr tsering wangdi sherpa , 27 , is currently running the clinic , which serves 8,000 patients from the four main valleys of the khumbu district .
" it 's very important to have this hospital , " he says .
" before it was built , the health system here was absolutely bad .
there were a lot of problems with birth control and immunisation .
people had very bad infections and the hygiene was really bad , " he says .
' unusual ' dr tsering has only been working at kunde hospital for the last seven months .
but he has been connected to the clinic all his life .
he was born here in 1983 - delivered by a canadian doctor who was volunteering at the time .
his father used to work as a health assistant to the foreign doctors , but thanks to a grant from the sir edmund hillary foundation of canada , he was able to complete his own medical degree and became the first sherpa doctor to work at kunde .
dr tsering has been connected to the hospital all his life " it was pretty unusual for my father to become a doctor , " says dr tsering .
" it was very expensive to afford the training .
the sherpas live around khumbu region which at the time was not very well-developed and most people did not have the money to afford good schools and colleges . "
dr tsering 's own training was also funded by the sir edmund hillary foundation .
he describes the new zealand mountaineer as a " godfather " to the sherpa people for building the hospital and helping the local community .
dr tsering works six days a week , running the 12-bed clinic from nine to five most days .
the small stone hospital , built on the side of a mountain with a view of the snow-capped mountains , is able to deal with minor surgeries and has a laboratory to conduct basic tests .
on the morning of my visit , dr tsering 's first patient is a man with an ingrown toenail .
he arrived at the clinic late last night and dr tsering performed basic surgery on him , removing the nail and cleaning the wound .
this morning he changes the dressing and checks for infection .
' important ' his next patients are both women who have come for their three-monthly contraceptive injection .
" the family planning service has been really important in improving the health of the people and encouraging them to have smaller families , " says dr tsering .
his patients come from far and wide one of the women has walked two-and-a-half hours to reach the clinic - nothing unusual for many patients in this region .
if the hospital did not exist , she would not know where to go for contraception , she said .
the clinic charges a basic fee of 20 nepali rupees -lrb- around 25 cents -rrb- per visit - whatever service is being provided .
the fee has stayed the same for the last 20 years and dr tsering says that it means that everyone can afford treatment .
one important area in which the clinic has improved health is by providing regular iodine injections to the local population .
" thyroidism was a big problem 40 years back because there was no iodine in the region , so we had many cases of goitre and cretinism , " says dr tsering .
" but after sir edmund hillary set up the hospital we no longer have this problem , " he says .
break but as the khumbu district has become more affluent , the hospital is now dealing with different diseases .
" we 've seen an increase in diabetes in those villages that are economically better , " says the doctor .
the view from the hospital is spectacular " their diet is getting worse and they have a more sedentary lifestyle because they have people working for them . "
as morning clinic ends , dr tsering and his colleagues take a break to drink hot sweet tea and eat freshly-baked bread .
sitting in front of the hospital , the view is spectacular .
the snow-covered peak of ama dablam dominates the skyline .
the sound of lamas chanting drifts down from a buddhist monastery high above them on the mountainside .
" it 's been really great working up here , " says dr tsering .
" sometimes it 's difficult because everything is in our hands .
when things get complicated , we have to use all our knowledge and all the equipment we have to help the patient . "
" but otherwise it 's really peaceful working here , " he says .

the posters plastered across milan use a mixture of blood and gore to attract a younger audience .
la scala spokesman carlo maria cella says it is a plan which is working : " every theatre has to cultivate a renewal of its audience .
as someone wrote : new blood for the old ceremony . "
attracting new audiences is the perpetual problem for an art form which is often accused of being elitist , and it is one opera companies in the uk have been trying to solve .
it is nearly 10 years since the royal opera house -lrb- roh -rrb- re-opened its doors after its refurbishment .
on average it is 5 % short of a full house every night - with demand for a recent run of carmen leading to a returns queue stretching around covent garden 's block .
barry stewart leads backstage tours at the roh , one of several initiatives aimed at making opera more accessible .
he agrees with mr cella : " it is very important for us to keep the momentum of our audience throughout the years .
" consider our traditional audience , well you have to make our new audience that traditional audience so through the years it is all about building up this audience . "
the roh 's building bricks include opera tickets with a starting price of £ 5 , cinema link-ups and summer screens , which this year beamed live productions to 40,000 people at outdoor events around the country .
it 's a similar story just down the road at the english national opera 's -lrb- eno -rrb- headquarters .
like the roh , eno have slashed some of their ticket prices to open up the market .
" we have over 2,300 seats here so it 's really important to bring people in , " says eno chief loretta tomasi .
" we do a range of work for all audiences because it is not about alienating existing audiences - that would be really stupid .
but our core audience is very adventurous and they like to see different things being done . "
' embarrassing prospect ' this has led to various high-profile partnerships .
film-maker anthony minghella directed madame butterfly for the eno two years before his death in 2008 .
theatre pin-up rupert goold has turned his attention to opera , directing this season 's turandot .
however some of the audience grabbing initiatives fail to hit the mark , according to opera magazine 's assistant editor kate molleson .
" opera should certainly be available to anyone who wants to see it .
but trying to dumb it down so that it appeals to some sort of projection of what people think a younger audience might want is often quite an embarrassing prospect , " says ms molleson .
and ms molleson thinks there are still some barriers which need to be broken : " it 's not the art form that is elitist but it is sometimes the industry that surrounds it .
" it is also perhaps a problem more in this country than others where audiences are perhaps more representative of a certain demographic .
that is something that certainly needs to be worked upon . "
away from the opera houses opera singers have been embraced by the record buying public .
take this week 's sales .
katherine jenkins is dominating the classical album chart but she also has two albums in the main top 40 .
take that 's gary barlow is music 's latest maestro to embrace the classical cross-over , making soprano camilla kerslake his first signing to his own record label future records .
her debut album is a mix of genres and includes a classically inspired version of take that 's rule the world .
" i would n't necessarily say the classical people are as open to it as the general public but nowadays it is a lot easier to cross over , " she says .
" in some ways it has been dumbed down .

good music is good music and if you are opening something up and creating an emotional response , making people feel and care about classical music when they normally would n't , well i do n't think that is a bad thing . "
opera magazine 's ms molleson tends to agree : " what matters is the quality of what you are doing .
i think people will buy your album or go to your concert if you are good and that 's not to do with slapping a certain genre on it . "
opera has been something tv audiences switched on to two years ago , when paul potts won the first series of britain 's got talent .

as about 7,000 primary school pupils sharpen their pencils and prepare for the transfer exams , a group of lawyers may be getting ready too .
the 11-plus was abolished last year in northern ireland but with no political agreement on what to replace it with , the grammar schools have set their own entrance tests .
they may not be called ' 11-plus ' but the exams largely perform the same function , deciding which pupils qualify for grammar school places .
' breakaway schools ' the system has been disowned by the department of education in northern ireland , amid warnings over possible legal action .
education minister caitriona ruane of sinn fein , told bbc news online : " these tests are being run and organised by breakaway grammar schools .
" they are leaving themselves wide open to legal cases against them .
i have written , and my officials have written , advising them of the dangers .
" in the past , the state provided the test , corrected the test , trialled the test , sent out results of the test .
we are having nothing to do with these tests . "
the department of education insists that the minister is not threatening the schools , simply encouraging them to be aware of their legal responsibilities .
sample maths questions 108 x 482 = 216 x ?

what is the cost of 250g of flour ?
click to scroll down to answers however , the schools involved may not interpret it that way .
the image they may see is of an angry minister waving a big stick , rather than patting them on the back sympathetically .
northern ireland 's gcse and a-level results are among the best in the uk , and the grammar schools believe this could be jeopardised by the new system .
the truth is that the row over education in northern ireland is personal as well as political .
there are major differences between the main parties on the whole issue of post-primary selection procedures , and the search for a resolution is not helped by a breakdown in relations between the minister and some rival politicians .
' minister for mayhem ' caitriona ruane believes the old system was unfair , and placed too much pressure on children at a young age .
supporters of the 11-plus system say she has a closed mind on the transfer issue and does too much talking , and not enough listening .
mervyn storey , the education spokesman for the largest unionist party , the dup , has labelled her the ' minister for mayhem ' and said she 'd be better named ' caitriona ruin ' .
he told the last dup annual conference : " when it comes to education matters , caitriona ruane is about as confused as adam was on mothers ' day and is about as much use as a trapdoor on a canoe . "
these playground jibes may get a laugh and a round of applause at a party conference , but they do not help sort out the political stand-off .
indeed , there does not seem to be any sign of movement soon .
views are so entrenched that the power-sharing executive has stopped discussing the issue at their regular cabinet meetings .
caught in the middle are the pupils .
the old 11-plus system was relatively straightforward .
tests were held in primary schools on friday mornings .
all pupils - whether they were catholics or protestants - did the same two tests .
now there are two different entrance tests to chose from - one used mainly by catholic grammar schools , the other used by schools mostly attended by protestants .
answers to sample questions 241 33.3 % 35 pence click to return to questions and this is supposed to be an era when divisions in northern ireland are narrowing .
the tests are being held at weekends , rather than during school time , and take place in grammar schools rather than the familiar surroundings of primary schools .
as for the tests themselves , they are completely new .
there are no past papers to study .
the only clues about them are in sample papers provided by the examiners .
the hardest question of all is the one facing northern ireland 's politicians : how do they sort out the education debacle so that an agreed , regulated transfer system is in place by next year ?
ultimately , it may not just be politicians who will determine what happens next year - a judge could have a say as well .
