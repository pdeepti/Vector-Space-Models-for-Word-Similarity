program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.09.2009 still in slump , spain explores solutions to economic crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was brought to its knees when its property market collapsed with a public deficit nudging 10 percent of gdp , spain 's government is testing the waters on a series of recovery measures - from improved social protection to green stimulus . last week saw workers across spain protest at layoffs from the factories of bathroom manufacturer roca .
' what next ? ' read the banners of the angry demonstrators .
it 's a question most spaniards are asking as the country continues to wallow in recession .
for while france and germany have staged quick recoveries , spain is lagging behind .
spanish daily el pais reported this summer that the spanish gdp would shrink 4.2 percent this year , while the central european bank has predicted that it will be mid-2010 before the country starts to register growth .
spain buffeted by economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero says recovery will be slow prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government has been forced to admit that unemployment will likely rise to 20 percent this year of the working population and that the deficit is set to reach 10 percent of gdp .
the country has shed 1.3 million jobs in the last year , while employment figures for august show that last month , another 85,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed - over 18 percent of the active population .
that puts spain 's joblessness at more than double the eu average , a development blamed largely on the collapse of the spanish housing market and the end of the construction boom .
as a result , government spending has escalated and zapatero has warned that next year 's budget will " be the most austere spain has seen in the recent years . "
last week , he told parliament that recovery will be slow .
" signs that the deterioration is slowing does not mean that a recovery is here or will be fast .
there are signs that the worst of the recession has passed , but we are still suffering an intense crisis , " he said .
wefare and green energy so what is his government doing to help spain weather the crisis ?
with over a million unemployed people without any form of government support , one focus is welfare .
keen to keep unions on its side in the face of dwindling public support , the government has agreed to pay 420 euros a month to those who have exhausted their social security quotas , backdated to january 2009 .
around 600,000 people will benefit from the scheme , but it will cost the government an extra 100 million euros per month .
meanwhile , to reactivate the economy , the government has announced a new finance model that has echoes of a green new deal .
spain 's debt-fuelled property boom paid scant attention to either environmental concerns or sustainability .
now , the government has announced a 25- illion-euro stimulus package to boost technological innovation , investments in renewables and energy efficiency .
it makes sense for spain to play to its strengths .
after all , the country provided for 35 percent of its energy needs in january 2009 with renewables - making a saving of 90 million euros on gas imports , according to the wwf energy observatory .
moderate and temporary as for plugging the 50-billion-euro public deficit , the government has floated a couple of ideas in the last week ahead of 2010 budget announcements , due to be passed on 18 september .
one is to freeze civil servants ' salaries , introduce cuts across the ministries , and another , more controversially , to raise taxes .
zapatero announced the move , without enthusiasm , last week : " we are going to look at capital income , not at wages , to ask for a small - and it 's going to be small - increase in the contribution to the public purse .
it 's going to be moderate and as far as we can manage it , temporary , " he said .
no more false hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood in spain is subdued whatever form they take , tax hikes are likely to be passed through pacting with the left .
the government 's socialist approach to the crisis has attracted scorn from the main government opposition , the conservative pp who have also accused them of erratic and improvised policy .
the government has also been accused of failing to admit to the extent of the damage .
until recently , ministers expressed overriding optimism - choosing to focus on improving consumer confidence , the madrid stockmarket 's positive performance and the fact that even though unemployment is increasing , the rate is slowing .
but even before zapatero finally spelt out the grim truth about spain 's prospects of recovery this week , a more realistic mood had been apparent in madrid .
in july , deputy prime minister and economics minister elena salgado conceded that the economic outlook was worse than had been acknowledged .
the new honesty might prove constructive .
shows of unity from government , unions and business leaders have kept demonstrations like that at the roca plant to a minimum so far .
but with fresh economic data emerging that shows spain is by no means out of the woods , the government can not afford to raise false hopes .

" we went to and have stayed in afghanistan to prevent terrorist attacks , including against ourselves , " steinmeier told super illu magazine .
" but we do n't want to stay forever .
the aim , over the course of the next parliamentary period , is to lay the foundations for a withdrawal . "
the foreign minister refused , however , to give a definite deadline for when the soldiers are to be out .
" it would n't be prudent to inform terrorist forces of the precise year in which the last foreign soldier will have left afghanistan , " he said .
the announcement is a move that could win steinmeier votes in the upcoming september 27 elections when he 'll be running as the social democratic candidate against incumbent german chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats .
the german foreign minister said the timeline of the withdrawal would depend on the capabilities of the local afghan forces .
talks are needed " to determine how long we and other international soldiers will have to stay and how many more afghan soldiers and policemen have to be trained to take full charge of security . "
afghanistan is back on the election agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is also pushing for an early exit german chancellor angela merkel touched upon an early german withdrawal from afghanistan herself on saturday .
" in association with our partners , we want to hammer out a strategy allowing for the transfer of responsibility to afghanistan over five years , " merkel said in an interview published in saturday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
on sunday night , merkel and steinmeier are to face each other in a televised debate which may help to determine the outcome of the september 27 election .
polls show that around 60 percent of voters want an end to germany 's participation in the nato mission .
all of germany 's major parties , other than the far-left left party , have so far backed the deployment of german troops in northern afghanistan .
karzai commission confirms 30 civilian deaths a controversial airstrike called by german troops in afghanistan earlier this month that killed scores of people has brought the issue back into the election campaign .
on sunday , a commission set up by afghan president hamid karzai said that a total of 30 civilians and 69 taliban were killed in the airstrike .
but mohamadulla batai of the commission added that the responsibility for the tragedy remained with the taliban and defended the german officer who ordered the airstrike . " not only the german troops would have ordered the airstrikes , " batai said .
" all of the international and national forces would have acted likewise .
if these fuel trucks had remained in the hands of enemies , they would have used them for terrorist purposes . " germany , britain and france last week called for an international conference on afghanistan to be held by the end of the year to set new goals for the nato mission in the country. ai / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said the decision was " made with the intention of preventing significant danger , " to german , allied and afghan security forces . many german officials - including defense minister franz josef jung and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , both christian democrats - have already supported the decision to order the airstrike just over a week ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 13.09.2009 opel sale sparks widespread criticism in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel logo may lose some of its sheen if critics are proved right gm 's planned sale of carmaker opel to supplier magna has been welcomed by top german politicians .
but elsewhere criticism of the deal is growing amid reports of unfair competition and greater job losses than expected . with federal elections just two weeks away , top-ranking german politicians are celebrating general motors ' decision to sell ailing carmaker opel to canadian-austrian car parts maker magna .
the deal is seen in germany as a coup for chancellor angela merkel whose government had pressed hard for gm to choose a consortium of magna and sberbank of russia , offering 4.5 billion euros in german taxpayers ' money .
but the euphoria may be short-lived if a report in news magazine der spiegel is confirmed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to germany , opel employs thousands in other european nations the magazine said on saturday that magna plans to lay off more employees in germany than previously thought .
on top of 3,000 jobs in the production lines , another 1,100 are to be scrapped in the administration , it said .
the magna deal was favored in germany as it promised to preserve more jobs than rival bidder rhj international .
around half of gm 's 50,000 strong european work force is based in germany and opel 's new owners have pledged to keep open its four main plants in the country .
but the carmaker also employs thousands in spain , britain , belgium , italy , austria and france .
and fears are now growing that the new owners , magna and sberbank of russia , might axe jobs in other european sites in a bid to minimize losses in germany .
gm vice-president john smith said in berlin this week that opel 's new owners were " contemplating " winding down a plant in antwerp , belgium , and shifting some production from spain to germany .
state negotiator slams opel deal making matters more complicated for chancellor angela merkel 's government , the representative of the german federal states at the opel negotiations , dirk pfeil , also described the opel sale to magna as a " serious mistake . "
in an interview with radio station deutschlandfunk on saturday , pfeil said had he would not have taken part in the discussions had he “ known that it was going to be a purely political decision , and that business management considerations would be left in the shadows . ”
“ it is unique in my professional life that the party which has been acting as guarantor also decides on the buyer .
that is a bit odd and it does not fit into the system , " pfeil said .
eu warns of action against protectionism general motors announced this week it will sell 55 percent of its european subsidiary opel to magna and its russian partner bank sberbank and carmaker gaz .
gm will only retain a minority stake of 35 percent , while ten percent is to be held by opel employees .
the opel sale to magna has also attracted the interest of the european commission .
on saturday , european union competition commissioner neelie kroes warned she will take action if there is any protectionism in the sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes has warned of tough action if any protectionism is detected in the opel deal the belgian government says it wants the eu commission to investigate the opel deal amid concern that germany allegedly sought to protect its own plants at the cost of others .
kroes was quoted as saying saturday that " if something happens against the rules , i will take action . "
kroes added that state support should not be tied to factory locations .
merkel denies deal was politically motivated chancellor merkel on saturday however dismissed fears that the eu commission could put the brakes on the deals or block berlin 's package of government aid for opel .
in the sueddeutsche newspaper , she pointed out that the general framework of government aid from which the billions for opel are to come have already been approved by the commission .
there 's also criticism from within germany that berlin 's pressure on gm to favor magna was mostly politically motivated .
with general elections coming up on sept .
27 , the two parties in the current grand coalition needed a quick solution to the opel problem and a solution with as little job cuts within germany as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism has put chancellor merkel on the defensive analysts warn , however , that the true cost of the deal and more details about layoffs will be known only after the general election .
chancellor merkel on saturday dismissed that the opel rescue was politically motivated .
" we are not rescuing corporations , but are maintaining a chance for them in the financial crisis , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" but of course the company needs a solid concept for the future .
any company then has to prove itself on the market , there 's no way that the government can take off that pressure . " ai / dpa / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kroes was quoted as saying saturday that " if something happens against the rules , i will take action . "
kroes added that state support should not be tied to factory locations .
merkel denies deal was politically motivated chancellor merkel on saturday however dismissed fears that the eu commission could put the brakes on the deals or block berlin 's package of government aid for opel .
in the sueddeutsche newspaper , she pointed out that the general framework of government aid from which the billions for opel are to come have already been approved by the commission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 13.09.2009 opel sale sparks widespread criticism in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel logo may lose some of its sheen if critics are proved right gm 's planned sale of carmaker opel to supplier magna has been welcomed by top german politicians .
but elsewhere criticism of the deal is growing amid reports of unfair competition and greater job losses than expected . with federal elections just two weeks away , top-ranking german politicians are celebrating general motors ' decision to sell ailing carmaker opel to canadian-austrian car parts maker magna .
the deal is seen in germany as a coup for chancellor angela merkel whose government had pressed hard for gm to choose a consortium of magna and sberbank of russia , offering 4.5 billion euros in german taxpayers ' money .
but the euphoria may be short-lived if a report in news magazine der spiegel is confirmed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to germany , opel employs thousands in other european nations the magazine said on saturday that magna plans to lay off more employees in germany than previously thought .
on top of 3,000 jobs in the production lines , another 1,100 are to be scrapped in the administration , it said .
the magna deal was favored in germany as it promised to preserve more jobs than rival bidder rhj international .
around half of gm 's 50,000 strong european work force is based in germany and opel 's new owners have pledged to keep open its four main plants in the country .
but the carmaker also employs thousands in spain , britain , belgium , italy , austria and france .
and fears are now growing that the new owners , magna and sberbank of russia , might axe jobs in other european sites in a bid to minimize losses in germany .
gm vice-president john smith said in berlin this week that opel 's new owners were " contemplating " winding down a plant in antwerp , belgium , and shifting some production from spain to germany .
state negotiator slams opel deal making matters more complicated for chancellor angela merkel 's government , the representative of the german federal states at the opel negotiations , dirk pfeil , also described the opel sale to magna as a " serious mistake . "
in an interview with radio station deutschlandfunk on saturday , pfeil said had he would not have taken part in the discussions had he “ known that it was going to be a purely political decision , and that business management considerations would be left in the shadows . ”
“ it is unique in my professional life that the party which has been acting as guarantor also decides on the buyer .
that is a bit odd and it does not fit into the system , " pfeil said .
eu warns of action against protectionism general motors announced this week it will sell 55 percent of its european subsidiary opel to magna and its russian partner bank sberbank and carmaker gaz .
gm will only retain a minority stake of 35 percent , while ten percent is to be held by opel employees .
the opel sale to magna has also attracted the interest of the european commission .
on saturday , european union competition commissioner neelie kroes warned she will take action if there is any protectionism in the sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes has warned of tough action if any protectionism is detected in the opel deal the belgian government says it wants the eu commission to investigate the opel deal amid concern that germany allegedly sought to protect its own plants at the cost of others .
kroes was quoted as saying saturday that " if something happens against the rules , i will take action . "
kroes added that state support should not be tied to factory locations .
merkel denies deal was politically motivated chancellor merkel on saturday however dismissed fears that the eu commission could put the brakes on the deals or block berlin 's package of government aid for opel .
in the sueddeutsche newspaper , she pointed out that the general framework of government aid from which the billions for opel are to come have already been approved by the commission .
there 's also criticism from within germany that berlin 's pressure on gm to favor magna was mostly politically motivated .
with general elections coming up on sept .
27 , the two parties in the current grand coalition needed a quick solution to the opel problem and a solution with as little job cuts within germany as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism has put chancellor merkel on the defensive analysts warn , however , that the true cost of the deal and more details about layoffs will be known only after the general election .
chancellor merkel on saturday dismissed that the opel rescue was politically motivated .
" we are not rescuing corporations , but are maintaining a chance for them in the financial crisis , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" but of course the company needs a solid concept for the future .
any company then has to prove itself on the market , there 's no way that the government can take off that pressure . " ai / dpa / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we went to and have stayed in afghanistan to prevent terrorist attacks , including against ourselves , " steinmeier told super illu magazine .
" but we do n't want to stay forever .
the aim , over the course of the next parliamentary period , is to lay the foundations for a withdrawal . "
the foreign minister refused , however , to give a definite deadline for when the soldiers are to be out .
" it would n't be prudent to inform terrorist forces of the precise year in which the last foreign soldier will have left afghanistan , " he said .
the announcement is a move that could win steinmeier votes in the upcoming september 27 elections when he 'll be running as the social democratic candidate against incumbent german chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats .
the german foreign minister said the timeline of the withdrawal would depend on the capabilities of the local afghan forces .
talks are needed " to determine how long we and other international soldiers will have to stay and how many more afghan soldiers and policemen have to be trained to take full charge of security . "
afghanistan is back on the election agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is also pushing for an early exit german chancellor angela merkel touched upon an early german withdrawal from afghanistan herself on saturday .
" in association with our partners , we want to hammer out a strategy allowing for the transfer of responsibility to afghanistan over five years , " merkel said in an interview published in saturday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
on sunday night , merkel and steinmeier are to face each other in a televised debate which may help to determine the outcome of the september 27 election .
polls show that around 60 percent of voters want an end to germany 's participation in the nato mission .
all of germany 's major parties , other than the far-left left party , have so far backed the deployment of german troops in northern afghanistan .
karzai commission confirms 30 civilian deaths a controversial airstrike called by german troops in afghanistan earlier this month that killed scores of people has brought the issue back into the election campaign .
on sunday , a commission set up by afghan president hamid karzai said that a total of 30 civilians and 69 taliban were killed in the airstrike .
but mohamadulla batai of the commission added that the responsibility for the tragedy remained with the taliban and defended the german officer who ordered the airstrike . " not only the german troops would have ordered the airstrikes , " batai said .
" all of the international and national forces would have acted likewise .
if these fuel trucks had remained in the hands of enemies , they would have used them for terrorist purposes . " germany , britain and france last week called for an international conference on afghanistan to be held by the end of the year to set new goals for the nato mission in the country. ai / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.09.2009 merkel to face rival steinmeier in german election tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a live tv debate inject some spice into an uninspiring campaign ?
chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .
a recent poll puts steinmeier 's social democrats at 23 percent , far behind merkel 's conservatives on 36 percent . this is steinmeier 's first run at higher office and his poll numbers indicate that he has n't really connected with the public .
that may change tonight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are having trouble distinguishing between the policies of the two main parties " what we have seen so far is that steinmeier is uncomfortable in the role of candidate , " manfred guellner , the head of polling firm forsa said .
" it will be tough to score points against merkel , who has gained a lot of experience with public events like this . " tough , but not impossible .
a large swing in voter opinion is not unheard of in german politics . back in 2002 , in a debate between gerhard schroeder and edmund stoiber , schroeder hammered stoiber on iraq and turned a likely defeat for the spd into a victory . merkel has the upper hand chancellor merkel , could benefit from tonight 's debate in a couple of ways .
by holding her own , or even impressing the voters , she could stop the erosion of support for her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in recent weeks . despite the conservatives ' lead over the spd , it is far from certain whether merkel will win enough votes to form a coalition with her desired partners , the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . nearly two-thirds of germans -lrb- 64 percent -rrb- believe merkel will " win " sunday 's debate , compared to only 15 percent who think steinmeier will triumph , according to a poll for ard public television. av / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .
a recent poll puts steinmeier 's social democrats at 23 percent , far behind merkel 's conservatives on 36 percent . this is steinmeier 's first run at higher office and his poll numbers indicate that he has n't really connected with the public .
that may change tonight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are having trouble distinguishing between the policies of the two main parties " what we have seen so far is that steinmeier is uncomfortable in the role of candidate , " manfred guellner , the head of polling firm forsa said .
" it will be tough to score points against merkel , who has gained a lot of experience with public events like this . " tough , but not impossible .
a large swing in voter opinion is not unheard of in german politics . back in 2002 , in a debate between gerhard schroeder and edmund stoiber , schroeder hammered stoiber on iraq and turned a likely defeat for the spd into a victory . merkel has the upper hand chancellor merkel , could benefit from tonight 's debate in a couple of ways .
by holding her own , or even impressing the voters , she could stop the erosion of support for her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in recent weeks . despite the conservatives ' lead over the spd , it is far from certain whether merkel will win enough votes to form a coalition with her desired partners , the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . nearly two-thirds of germans -lrb- 64 percent -rrb- believe merkel will " win " sunday 's debate , compared to only 15 percent who think steinmeier will triumph , according to a poll for ard public television. av / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.09.2009 still in slump , spain explores solutions to economic crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was brought to its knees when its property market collapsed with a public deficit nudging 10 percent of gdp , spain 's government is testing the waters on a series of recovery measures - from improved social protection to green stimulus . last week saw workers across spain protest at layoffs from the factories of bathroom manufacturer roca .
' what next ? ' read the banners of the angry demonstrators .
it 's a question most spaniards are asking as the country continues to wallow in recession .
for while france and germany have staged quick recoveries , spain is lagging behind .
spanish daily el pais reported this summer that the spanish gdp would shrink 4.2 percent this year , while the central european bank has predicted that it will be mid-2010 before the country starts to register growth .
spain buffeted by economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero says recovery will be slow prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government has been forced to admit that unemployment will likely rise to 20 percent this year of the working population and that the deficit is set to reach 10 percent of gdp .
the country has shed 1.3 million jobs in the last year , while employment figures for august show that last month , another 85,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed - over 18 percent of the active population .
that puts spain 's joblessness at more than double the eu average , a development blamed largely on the collapse of the spanish housing market and the end of the construction boom .
as a result , government spending has escalated and zapatero has warned that next year 's budget will " be the most austere spain has seen in the recent years . "
last week , he told parliament that recovery will be slow .
" signs that the deterioration is slowing does not mean that a recovery is here or will be fast .
there are signs that the worst of the recession has passed , but we are still suffering an intense crisis , " he said .
wefare and green energy so what is his government doing to help spain weather the crisis ?
with over a million unemployed people without any form of government support , one focus is welfare .
keen to keep unions on its side in the face of dwindling public support , the government has agreed to pay 420 euros a month to those who have exhausted their social security quotas , backdated to january 2009 .
around 600,000 people will benefit from the scheme , but it will cost the government an extra 100 million euros per month .
meanwhile , to reactivate the economy , the government has announced a new finance model that has echoes of a green new deal .
spain 's debt-fuelled property boom paid scant attention to either environmental concerns or sustainability .
now , the government has announced a 25- illion-euro stimulus package to boost technological innovation , investments in renewables and energy efficiency .
it makes sense for spain to play to its strengths .
after all , the country provided for 35 percent of its energy needs in january 2009 with renewables - making a saving of 90 million euros on gas imports , according to the wwf energy observatory .
moderate and temporary as for plugging the 50-billion-euro public deficit , the government has floated a couple of ideas in the last week ahead of 2010 budget announcements , due to be passed on 18 september .
one is to freeze civil servants ' salaries , introduce cuts across the ministries , and another , more controversially , to raise taxes .
zapatero announced the move , without enthusiasm , last week : " we are going to look at capital income , not at wages , to ask for a small - and it 's going to be small - increase in the contribution to the public purse .
it 's going to be moderate and as far as we can manage it , temporary , " he said .
no more false hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood in spain is subdued whatever form they take , tax hikes are likely to be passed through pacting with the left .
the government 's socialist approach to the crisis has attracted scorn from the main government opposition , the conservative pp who have also accused them of erratic and improvised policy .
the government has also been accused of failing to admit to the extent of the damage .
until recently , ministers expressed overriding optimism - choosing to focus on improving consumer confidence , the madrid stockmarket 's positive performance and the fact that even though unemployment is increasing , the rate is slowing .
but even before zapatero finally spelt out the grim truth about spain 's prospects of recovery this week , a more realistic mood had been apparent in madrid .
in july , deputy prime minister and economics minister elena salgado conceded that the economic outlook was worse than had been acknowledged .
the new honesty might prove constructive .
shows of unity from government , unions and business leaders have kept demonstrations like that at the roca plant to a minimum so far .
but with fresh economic data emerging that shows spain is by no means out of the woods , the government can not afford to raise false hopes .

spain buffeted by economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero says recovery will be slow prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government has been forced to admit that unemployment will likely rise to 20 percent this year of the working population and that the deficit is set to reach 10 percent of gdp .
the country has shed 1.3 million jobs in the last year , while employment figures for august show that last month , another 85,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed - over 18 percent of the active population .
that puts spain 's joblessness at more than double the eu average , a development blamed largely on the collapse of the spanish housing market and the end of the construction boom .

around 600,000 people will benefit from the scheme , but it will cost the government an extra 100 million euros per month .
meanwhile , to reactivate the economy , the government has announced a new finance model that has echoes of a green new deal .
spain 's debt-fuelled property boom paid scant attention to either environmental concerns or sustainability .
now , the government has announced a 25- illion-euro stimulus package to boost technological innovation , investments in renewables and energy efficiency .
it makes sense for spain to play to its strengths .
after all , the country provided for 35 percent of its energy needs in january 2009 with renewables - making a saving of 90 million euros on gas imports , according to the wwf energy observatory .
moderate and temporary as for plugging the 50-billion-euro public deficit , the government has floated a couple of ideas in the last week ahead of 2010 budget announcements , due to be passed on 18 september .
one is to freeze civil servants ' salaries , introduce cuts across the ministries , and another , more controversially , to raise taxes .
zapatero announced the move , without enthusiasm , last week : " we are going to look at capital income , not at wages , to ask for a small - and it 's going to be small - increase in the contribution to the public purse .
it 's going to be moderate and as far as we can manage it , temporary , " he said .

spain buffeted by economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero says recovery will be slow prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government has been forced to admit that unemployment will likely rise to 20 percent this year of the working population and that the deficit is set to reach 10 percent of gdp .
the country has shed 1.3 million jobs in the last year , while employment figures for august show that last month , another 85,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed - over 18 percent of the active population .
that puts spain 's joblessness at more than double the eu average , a development blamed largely on the collapse of the spanish housing market and the end of the construction boom .

after all , the country provided for 35 percent of its energy needs in january 2009 with renewables - making a saving of 90 million euros on gas imports , according to the wwf energy observatory .
moderate and temporary as for plugging the 50-billion-euro public deficit , the government has floated a couple of ideas in the last week ahead of 2010 budget announcements , due to be passed on 18 september .
one is to freeze civil servants ' salaries , introduce cuts across the ministries , and another , more controversially , to raise taxes .
zapatero announced the move , without enthusiasm , last week : " we are going to look at capital income , not at wages , to ask for a small - and it 's going to be small - increase in the contribution to the public purse .

it 's a question most spaniards are asking as the country continues to wallow in recession .

spain buffeted by economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero says recovery will be slow prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government has been forced to admit that unemployment will likely rise to 20 percent this year of the working population and that the deficit is set to reach 10 percent of gdp .
the country has shed 1.3 million jobs in the last year , while employment figures for august show that last month , another 85,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed - over 18 percent of the active population .
that puts spain 's joblessness at more than double the eu average , a development blamed largely on the collapse of the spanish housing market and the end of the construction boom .
as a result , government spending has escalated and zapatero has warned that next year 's budget will " be the most austere spain has seen in the recent years . "
last week , he told parliament that recovery will be slow .
" signs that the deterioration is slowing does not mean that a recovery is here or will be fast .
there are signs that the worst of the recession has passed , but we are still suffering an intense crisis , " he said .
wefare and green energy so what is his government doing to help spain weather the crisis ?
with over a million unemployed people without any form of government support , one focus is welfare .
keen to keep unions on its side in the face of dwindling public support , the government has agreed to pay 420 euros a month to those who have exhausted their social security quotas , backdated to january 2009 .
around 600,000 people will benefit from the scheme , but it will cost the government an extra 100 million euros per month .
meanwhile , to reactivate the economy , the government has announced a new finance model that has echoes of a green new deal .
spain 's debt-fuelled property boom paid scant attention to either environmental concerns or sustainability .
now , the government has announced a 25- illion-euro stimulus package to boost technological innovation , investments in renewables and energy efficiency .
it makes sense for spain to play to its strengths .
after all , the country provided for 35 percent of its energy needs in january 2009 with renewables - making a saving of 90 million euros on gas imports , according to the wwf energy observatory .
moderate and temporary as for plugging the 50-billion-euro public deficit , the government has floated a couple of ideas in the last week ahead of 2010 budget announcements , due to be passed on 18 september .
one is to freeze civil servants ' salaries , introduce cuts across the ministries , and another , more controversially , to raise taxes .
zapatero announced the move , without enthusiasm , last week : " we are going to look at capital income , not at wages , to ask for a small - and it 's going to be small - increase in the contribution to the public purse .
it 's going to be moderate and as far as we can manage it , temporary , " he said .
no more false hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood in spain is subdued whatever form they take , tax hikes are likely to be passed through pacting with the left .
the government 's socialist approach to the crisis has attracted scorn from the main government opposition , the conservative pp who have also accused them of erratic and improvised policy .
the government has also been accused of failing to admit to the extent of the damage .
until recently , ministers expressed overriding optimism - choosing to focus on improving consumer confidence , the madrid stockmarket 's positive performance and the fact that even though unemployment is increasing , the rate is slowing .
but even before zapatero finally spelt out the grim truth about spain 's prospects of recovery this week , a more realistic mood had been apparent in madrid .
in july , deputy prime minister and economics minister elena salgado conceded that the economic outlook was worse than had been acknowledged .
the new honesty might prove constructive .
shows of unity from government , unions and business leaders have kept demonstrations like that at the roca plant to a minimum so far .
but with fresh economic data emerging that shows spain is by no means out of the woods , the government can not afford to raise false hopes .

"
the coveted golden lion award went to israeli filmmaker samuel maoz . fatih akin 's comedy " soul kitchen " is a romantic comedy following the fortunes of a restaurant and its owner , a scruffy looking german-greek .
the food is n't exactly top-notch in his locals-only restaurant , but his clientele remain loyal . however , when zinos , played by adam bousdoukos , brings in a more talented chef to improve the menu , the local 's revolt is just the start of his problems . akin won the golden bear award at the 2004 berlinale film festival for his more serious film " head on , " and in 2007 another weightier film , " edge of heaven , " won him the screenplay award at cannes .
akin said he wanted to stretch his wings and try something new this year . " as a director , i want to make experiments , and i get bored with directors that make one style .
i want to change and go on testing my style . " war dramas clinch big prizes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian director shirin neshat scooped the best director award however , it was an entirely serious film that won the coveted golden lion prize for best film , the award that akin was really eyeing with soul kitchen . " lebanon " by israeli director samuel maoz , is set during the first day of israel 's 1982 conflict in lebanon .
it is shot from the perspective of soldiers holed up in a tank , and clever cinematography forces the audience to share the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere . maoz said earlier in the week that he was so traumatized by his real-life experience as a young soldier during the lebanon war that it took him a quarter of a century to pluck up the courage to revisit his own past and make the movie . but bragging rights amongst the directors belong to iranian-born visual artist shirin neshat .
neshat won the silver lion award for best director for her film " women without men . "
the tale follows the fate of four women during iran 's 1953 cia-backed coup d 'etat . honorable mentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore released " capitalism : a love story " in venice russia 's ksenia rappoport won the coppa volpi prize for best actress , for her role as a waitress who meets a former policeman on a speed date in the italian noir thriller , " la doppia ora . "
britain 's colin firth won the best actor prize , for his portrayal of a discreet university professor coming to terms with the death of his gay lover in " a single man . " meanwhile , the festival stole the headlines primarily for its political flavor this year .
controversial us director michael moore premiered his latest documentary entitled " capitalism : a love story , " and those familiar with his work will not be surprised to hear that the title is dripping with irony .
moore assaults wall street 's wheeling and dealing , blaming excessive financial speculation for the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the bankruptcy of major banks and companies like general motors . also , venezuelan president hugo chavez stole a little of the limelight on his european diplomatic tour .
earlier in the week the controversial latin american leader attended the premiere of oliver stone 's " south of the border " - a movie condemning what it portrays as a us smear campaign against venezuela 's socialist leader . the awards ceremony on saturday marked the end of the 66th venice film festival , the world 's oldest silver screen celebration. msh / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 13.09.2009 opel sale sparks widespread criticism in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel logo may lose some of its sheen if critics are proved right gm 's planned sale of carmaker opel to supplier magna has been welcomed by top german politicians .
but elsewhere criticism of the deal is growing amid reports of unfair competition and greater job losses than expected . with federal elections just two weeks away , top-ranking german politicians are celebrating general motors ' decision to sell ailing carmaker opel to canadian-austrian car parts maker magna .
the deal is seen in germany as a coup for chancellor angela merkel whose government had pressed hard for gm to choose a consortium of magna and sberbank of russia , offering 4.5 billion euros in german taxpayers ' money .
but the euphoria may be short-lived if a report in news magazine der spiegel is confirmed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to germany , opel employs thousands in other european nations the magazine said on saturday that magna plans to lay off more employees in germany than previously thought .
on top of 3,000 jobs in the production lines , another 1,100 are to be scrapped in the administration , it said .
the magna deal was favored in germany as it promised to preserve more jobs than rival bidder rhj international .
around half of gm 's 50,000 strong european work force is based in germany and opel 's new owners have pledged to keep open its four main plants in the country .
but the carmaker also employs thousands in spain , britain , belgium , italy , austria and france .
and fears are now growing that the new owners , magna and sberbank of russia , might axe jobs in other european sites in a bid to minimize losses in germany .
gm vice-president john smith said in berlin this week that opel 's new owners were " contemplating " winding down a plant in antwerp , belgium , and shifting some production from spain to germany .
state negotiator slams opel deal making matters more complicated for chancellor angela merkel 's government , the representative of the german federal states at the opel negotiations , dirk pfeil , also described the opel sale to magna as a " serious mistake . "
in an interview with radio station deutschlandfunk on saturday , pfeil said had he would not have taken part in the discussions had he “ known that it was going to be a purely political decision , and that business management considerations would be left in the shadows . ”
“ it is unique in my professional life that the party which has been acting as guarantor also decides on the buyer .
that is a bit odd and it does not fit into the system , " pfeil said .
eu warns of action against protectionism general motors announced this week it will sell 55 percent of its european subsidiary opel to magna and its russian partner bank sberbank and carmaker gaz .
gm will only retain a minority stake of 35 percent , while ten percent is to be held by opel employees .
the opel sale to magna has also attracted the interest of the european commission .
on saturday , european union competition commissioner neelie kroes warned she will take action if there is any protectionism in the sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes has warned of tough action if any protectionism is detected in the opel deal the belgian government says it wants the eu commission to investigate the opel deal amid concern that germany allegedly sought to protect its own plants at the cost of others .
kroes was quoted as saying saturday that " if something happens against the rules , i will take action . "
kroes added that state support should not be tied to factory locations .
merkel denies deal was politically motivated chancellor merkel on saturday however dismissed fears that the eu commission could put the brakes on the deals or block berlin 's package of government aid for opel .
in the sueddeutsche newspaper , she pointed out that the general framework of government aid from which the billions for opel are to come have already been approved by the commission .
there 's also criticism from within germany that berlin 's pressure on gm to favor magna was mostly politically motivated .
with general elections coming up on sept .
27 , the two parties in the current grand coalition needed a quick solution to the opel problem and a solution with as little job cuts within germany as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism has put chancellor merkel on the defensive analysts warn , however , that the true cost of the deal and more details about layoffs will be known only after the general election .
chancellor merkel on saturday dismissed that the opel rescue was politically motivated .
" we are not rescuing corporations , but are maintaining a chance for them in the financial crisis , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" but of course the company needs a solid concept for the future .
any company then has to prove itself on the market , there 's no way that the government can take off that pressure . " ai / dpa / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but elsewhere criticism of the deal is growing amid reports of unfair competition and greater job losses than expected . with federal elections just two weeks away , top-ranking german politicians are celebrating general motors ' decision to sell ailing carmaker opel to canadian-austrian car parts maker magna .
the deal is seen in germany as a coup for chancellor angela merkel whose government had pressed hard for gm to choose a consortium of magna and sberbank of russia , offering 4.5 billion euros in german taxpayers ' money .

kroes added that state support should not be tied to factory locations .
merkel denies deal was politically motivated chancellor merkel on saturday however dismissed fears that the eu commission could put the brakes on the deals or block berlin 's package of government aid for opel .

"
the coveted golden lion award went to israeli filmmaker samuel maoz . fatih akin 's comedy " soul kitchen " is a romantic comedy following the fortunes of a restaurant and its owner , a scruffy looking german-greek .
the food is n't exactly top-notch in his locals-only restaurant , but his clientele remain loyal . however , when zinos , played by adam bousdoukos , brings in a more talented chef to improve the menu , the local 's revolt is just the start of his problems . akin won the golden bear award at the 2004 berlinale film festival for his more serious film " head on , " and in 2007 another weightier film , " edge of heaven , " won him the screenplay award at cannes .
akin said he wanted to stretch his wings and try something new this year . " as a director , i want to make experiments , and i get bored with directors that make one style .
i want to change and go on testing my style . " war dramas clinch big prizes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian director shirin neshat scooped the best director award however , it was an entirely serious film that won the coveted golden lion prize for best film , the award that akin was really eyeing with soul kitchen . " lebanon " by israeli director samuel maoz , is set during the first day of israel 's 1982 conflict in lebanon .
it is shot from the perspective of soldiers holed up in a tank , and clever cinematography forces the audience to share the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere . maoz said earlier in the week that he was so traumatized by his real-life experience as a young soldier during the lebanon war that it took him a quarter of a century to pluck up the courage to revisit his own past and make the movie . but bragging rights amongst the directors belong to iranian-born visual artist shirin neshat .
neshat won the silver lion award for best director for her film " women without men . "
the tale follows the fate of four women during iran 's 1953 cia-backed coup d 'etat . honorable mentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore released " capitalism : a love story " in venice russia 's ksenia rappoport won the coppa volpi prize for best actress , for her role as a waitress who meets a former policeman on a speed date in the italian noir thriller , " la doppia ora . "
britain 's colin firth won the best actor prize , for his portrayal of a discreet university professor coming to terms with the death of his gay lover in " a single man . " meanwhile , the festival stole the headlines primarily for its political flavor this year .
controversial us director michael moore premiered his latest documentary entitled " capitalism : a love story , " and those familiar with his work will not be surprised to hear that the title is dripping with irony .
moore assaults wall street 's wheeling and dealing , blaming excessive financial speculation for the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the bankruptcy of major banks and companies like general motors . also , venezuelan president hugo chavez stole a little of the limelight on his european diplomatic tour .
earlier in the week the controversial latin american leader attended the premiere of oliver stone 's " south of the border " - a movie condemning what it portrays as a us smear campaign against venezuela 's socialist leader . the awards ceremony on saturday marked the end of the 66th venice film festival , the world 's oldest silver screen celebration. msh / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but elsewhere criticism of the deal is growing amid reports of unfair competition and greater job losses than expected . with federal elections just two weeks away , top-ranking german politicians are celebrating general motors ' decision to sell ailing carmaker opel to canadian-austrian car parts maker magna .
the deal is seen in germany as a coup for chancellor angela merkel whose government had pressed hard for gm to choose a consortium of magna and sberbank of russia , offering 4.5 billion euros in german taxpayers ' money .
but the euphoria may be short-lived if a report in news magazine der spiegel is confirmed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to germany , opel employs thousands in other european nations the magazine said on saturday that magna plans to lay off more employees in germany than previously thought .
on top of 3,000 jobs in the production lines , another 1,100 are to be scrapped in the administration , it said .
the magna deal was favored in germany as it promised to preserve more jobs than rival bidder rhj international .
around half of gm 's 50,000 strong european work force is based in germany and opel 's new owners have pledged to keep open its four main plants in the country .
but the carmaker also employs thousands in spain , britain , belgium , italy , austria and france .
and fears are now growing that the new owners , magna and sberbank of russia , might axe jobs in other european sites in a bid to minimize losses in germany .
gm vice-president john smith said in berlin this week that opel 's new owners were " contemplating " winding down a plant in antwerp , belgium , and shifting some production from spain to germany .
state negotiator slams opel deal making matters more complicated for chancellor angela merkel 's government , the representative of the german federal states at the opel negotiations , dirk pfeil , also described the opel sale to magna as a " serious mistake . "
in an interview with radio station deutschlandfunk on saturday , pfeil said had he would not have taken part in the discussions had he “ known that it was going to be a purely political decision , and that business management considerations would be left in the shadows . ”
“ it is unique in my professional life that the party which has been acting as guarantor also decides on the buyer .
that is a bit odd and it does not fit into the system , " pfeil said .
eu warns of action against protectionism general motors announced this week it will sell 55 percent of its european subsidiary opel to magna and its russian partner bank sberbank and carmaker gaz .
gm will only retain a minority stake of 35 percent , while ten percent is to be held by opel employees .
the opel sale to magna has also attracted the interest of the european commission .
on saturday , european union competition commissioner neelie kroes warned she will take action if there is any protectionism in the sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes has warned of tough action if any protectionism is detected in the opel deal the belgian government says it wants the eu commission to investigate the opel deal amid concern that germany allegedly sought to protect its own plants at the cost of others .
kroes was quoted as saying saturday that " if something happens against the rules , i will take action . "
kroes added that state support should not be tied to factory locations .
merkel denies deal was politically motivated chancellor merkel on saturday however dismissed fears that the eu commission could put the brakes on the deals or block berlin 's package of government aid for opel .
in the sueddeutsche newspaper , she pointed out that the general framework of government aid from which the billions for opel are to come have already been approved by the commission .
there 's also criticism from within germany that berlin 's pressure on gm to favor magna was mostly politically motivated .
with general elections coming up on sept .
27 , the two parties in the current grand coalition needed a quick solution to the opel problem and a solution with as little job cuts within germany as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism has put chancellor merkel on the defensive analysts warn , however , that the true cost of the deal and more details about layoffs will be known only after the general election .
chancellor merkel on saturday dismissed that the opel rescue was politically motivated .
" we are not rescuing corporations , but are maintaining a chance for them in the financial crisis , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" but of course the company needs a solid concept for the future .
any company then has to prove itself on the market , there 's no way that the government can take off that pressure . " ai / dpa / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .
a recent poll puts steinmeier 's social democrats at 23 percent , far behind merkel 's conservatives on 36 percent . this is steinmeier 's first run at higher office and his poll numbers indicate that he has n't really connected with the public .
that may change tonight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are having trouble distinguishing between the policies of the two main parties " what we have seen so far is that steinmeier is uncomfortable in the role of candidate , " manfred guellner , the head of polling firm forsa said .
" it will be tough to score points against merkel , who has gained a lot of experience with public events like this . " tough , but not impossible .
a large swing in voter opinion is not unheard of in german politics . back in 2002 , in a debate between gerhard schroeder and edmund stoiber , schroeder hammered stoiber on iraq and turned a likely defeat for the spd into a victory . merkel has the upper hand chancellor merkel , could benefit from tonight 's debate in a couple of ways .
by holding her own , or even impressing the voters , she could stop the erosion of support for her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in recent weeks . despite the conservatives ' lead over the spd , it is far from certain whether merkel will win enough votes to form a coalition with her desired partners , the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . nearly two-thirds of germans -lrb- 64 percent -rrb- believe merkel will " win " sunday 's debate , compared to only 15 percent who think steinmeier will triumph , according to a poll for ard public television. av / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said the decision was " made with the intention of preventing significant danger , " to german , allied and afghan security forces . many german officials - including defense minister franz josef jung and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , both christian democrats - have already supported the decision to order the airstrike just over a week ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command there are vastly conflicting reports on the extent of casualties caused by the attack , but afghan authorities are investigating the incident more closely , along with nato .
german media reports suggest that at least some civilians were killed in the attack . with just weeks to go before the german general election , the unpopular afghan conflict has been catapulted into the midst of campaign season . " impressed " by colonel 's command schneiderhahn also said he visited colonel klein in afghanistan this spring , and had an in-depth discussion with the commander about the difficulties operating in afghanistan . " the professionalism with which our soldiers are acting , under constant threat and in an unsure situation , impressed me , " schneiderhahn said . however , the strike has come under criticism from some of germany 's nato allies , and colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command by ordering the airstrike . klein himself has welcomed the investigation into the attack in an interview with mass-circulation daily bild , describing such investigations into lethal military strikes as " necessary and correct .

"
the coveted golden lion award went to israeli filmmaker samuel maoz . fatih akin 's comedy " soul kitchen " is a romantic comedy following the fortunes of a restaurant and its owner , a scruffy looking german-greek .
the food is n't exactly top-notch in his locals-only restaurant , but his clientele remain loyal . however , when zinos , played by adam bousdoukos , brings in a more talented chef to improve the menu , the local 's revolt is just the start of his problems . akin won the golden bear award at the 2004 berlinale film festival for his more serious film " head on , " and in 2007 another weightier film , " edge of heaven , " won him the screenplay award at cannes .
akin said he wanted to stretch his wings and try something new this year . " as a director , i want to make experiments , and i get bored with directors that make one style .
i want to change and go on testing my style . " war dramas clinch big prizes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian director shirin neshat scooped the best director award however , it was an entirely serious film that won the coveted golden lion prize for best film , the award that akin was really eyeing with soul kitchen . " lebanon " by israeli director samuel maoz , is set during the first day of israel 's 1982 conflict in lebanon .
it is shot from the perspective of soldiers holed up in a tank , and clever cinematography forces the audience to share the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere . maoz said earlier in the week that he was so traumatized by his real-life experience as a young soldier during the lebanon war that it took him a quarter of a century to pluck up the courage to revisit his own past and make the movie . but bragging rights amongst the directors belong to iranian-born visual artist shirin neshat .
neshat won the silver lion award for best director for her film " women without men . "
the tale follows the fate of four women during iran 's 1953 cia-backed coup d 'etat . honorable mentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore released " capitalism : a love story " in venice russia 's ksenia rappoport won the coppa volpi prize for best actress , for her role as a waitress who meets a former policeman on a speed date in the italian noir thriller , " la doppia ora . "
britain 's colin firth won the best actor prize , for his portrayal of a discreet university professor coming to terms with the death of his gay lover in " a single man . " meanwhile , the festival stole the headlines primarily for its political flavor this year .
controversial us director michael moore premiered his latest documentary entitled " capitalism : a love story , " and those familiar with his work will not be surprised to hear that the title is dripping with irony .
moore assaults wall street 's wheeling and dealing , blaming excessive financial speculation for the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the bankruptcy of major banks and companies like general motors . also , venezuelan president hugo chavez stole a little of the limelight on his european diplomatic tour .
earlier in the week the controversial latin american leader attended the premiere of oliver stone 's " south of the border " - a movie condemning what it portrays as a us smear campaign against venezuela 's socialist leader . the awards ceremony on saturday marked the end of the 66th venice film festival , the world 's oldest silver screen celebration. msh / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the coveted golden lion award went to israeli filmmaker samuel maoz . fatih akin 's comedy " soul kitchen " is a romantic comedy following the fortunes of a restaurant and its owner , a scruffy looking german-greek .
the food is n't exactly top-notch in his locals-only restaurant , but his clientele remain loyal . however , when zinos , played by adam bousdoukos , brings in a more talented chef to improve the menu , the local 's revolt is just the start of his problems . akin won the golden bear award at the 2004 berlinale film festival for his more serious film " head on , " and in 2007 another weightier film , " edge of heaven , " won him the screenplay award at cannes .
akin said he wanted to stretch his wings and try something new this year . " as a director , i want to make experiments , and i get bored with directors that make one style .
i want to change and go on testing my style . " war dramas clinch big prizes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian director shirin neshat scooped the best director award however , it was an entirely serious film that won the coveted golden lion prize for best film , the award that akin was really eyeing with soul kitchen . " lebanon " by israeli director samuel maoz , is set during the first day of israel 's 1982 conflict in lebanon .
it is shot from the perspective of soldiers holed up in a tank , and clever cinematography forces the audience to share the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere . maoz said earlier in the week that he was so traumatized by his real-life experience as a young soldier during the lebanon war that it took him a quarter of a century to pluck up the courage to revisit his own past and make the movie . but bragging rights amongst the directors belong to iranian-born visual artist shirin neshat .
neshat won the silver lion award for best director for her film " women without men . "
the tale follows the fate of four women during iran 's 1953 cia-backed coup d 'etat . honorable mentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore released " capitalism : a love story " in venice russia 's ksenia rappoport won the coppa volpi prize for best actress , for her role as a waitress who meets a former policeman on a speed date in the italian noir thriller , " la doppia ora . "
britain 's colin firth won the best actor prize , for his portrayal of a discreet university professor coming to terms with the death of his gay lover in " a single man . " meanwhile , the festival stole the headlines primarily for its political flavor this year .
controversial us director michael moore premiered his latest documentary entitled " capitalism : a love story , " and those familiar with his work will not be surprised to hear that the title is dripping with irony .
moore assaults wall street 's wheeling and dealing , blaming excessive financial speculation for the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the bankruptcy of major banks and companies like general motors . also , venezuelan president hugo chavez stole a little of the limelight on his european diplomatic tour .
earlier in the week the controversial latin american leader attended the premiere of oliver stone 's " south of the border " - a movie condemning what it portrays as a us smear campaign against venezuela 's socialist leader . the awards ceremony on saturday marked the end of the 66th venice film festival , the world 's oldest silver screen celebration. msh / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.09.2009 merkel to face rival steinmeier in german election tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a live tv debate inject some spice into an uninspiring campaign ?
chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .
a recent poll puts steinmeier 's social democrats at 23 percent , far behind merkel 's conservatives on 36 percent . this is steinmeier 's first run at higher office and his poll numbers indicate that he has n't really connected with the public .
that may change tonight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are having trouble distinguishing between the policies of the two main parties " what we have seen so far is that steinmeier is uncomfortable in the role of candidate , " manfred guellner , the head of polling firm forsa said .
" it will be tough to score points against merkel , who has gained a lot of experience with public events like this . " tough , but not impossible .
a large swing in voter opinion is not unheard of in german politics . back in 2002 , in a debate between gerhard schroeder and edmund stoiber , schroeder hammered stoiber on iraq and turned a likely defeat for the spd into a victory . merkel has the upper hand chancellor merkel , could benefit from tonight 's debate in a couple of ways .
by holding her own , or even impressing the voters , she could stop the erosion of support for her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in recent weeks . despite the conservatives ' lead over the spd , it is far from certain whether merkel will win enough votes to form a coalition with her desired partners , the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . nearly two-thirds of germans -lrb- 64 percent -rrb- believe merkel will " win " sunday 's debate , compared to only 15 percent who think steinmeier will triumph , according to a poll for ard public television. av / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .
a recent poll puts steinmeier 's social democrats at 23 percent , far behind merkel 's conservatives on 36 percent . this is steinmeier 's first run at higher office and his poll numbers indicate that he has n't really connected with the public .
that may change tonight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are having trouble distinguishing between the policies of the two main parties " what we have seen so far is that steinmeier is uncomfortable in the role of candidate , " manfred guellner , the head of polling firm forsa said .
" it will be tough to score points against merkel , who has gained a lot of experience with public events like this . " tough , but not impossible .
a large swing in voter opinion is not unheard of in german politics . back in 2002 , in a debate between gerhard schroeder and edmund stoiber , schroeder hammered stoiber on iraq and turned a likely defeat for the spd into a victory . merkel has the upper hand chancellor merkel , could benefit from tonight 's debate in a couple of ways .
by holding her own , or even impressing the voters , she could stop the erosion of support for her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in recent weeks . despite the conservatives ' lead over the spd , it is far from certain whether merkel will win enough votes to form a coalition with her desired partners , the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . nearly two-thirds of germans -lrb- 64 percent -rrb- believe merkel will " win " sunday 's debate , compared to only 15 percent who think steinmeier will triumph , according to a poll for ard public television. av / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .
a recent poll puts steinmeier 's social democrats at 23 percent , far behind merkel 's conservatives on 36 percent . this is steinmeier 's first run at higher office and his poll numbers indicate that he has n't really connected with the public .
that may change tonight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are having trouble distinguishing between the policies of the two main parties " what we have seen so far is that steinmeier is uncomfortable in the role of candidate , " manfred guellner , the head of polling firm forsa said .
" it will be tough to score points against merkel , who has gained a lot of experience with public events like this . " tough , but not impossible .
a large swing in voter opinion is not unheard of in german politics . back in 2002 , in a debate between gerhard schroeder and edmund stoiber , schroeder hammered stoiber on iraq and turned a likely defeat for the spd into a victory . merkel has the upper hand chancellor merkel , could benefit from tonight 's debate in a couple of ways .
by holding her own , or even impressing the voters , she could stop the erosion of support for her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in recent weeks . despite the conservatives ' lead over the spd , it is far from certain whether merkel will win enough votes to form a coalition with her desired partners , the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . nearly two-thirds of germans -lrb- 64 percent -rrb- believe merkel will " win " sunday 's debate , compared to only 15 percent who think steinmeier will triumph , according to a poll for ard public television. av / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .
a recent poll puts steinmeier 's social democrats at 23 percent , far behind merkel 's conservatives on 36 percent . this is steinmeier 's first run at higher office and his poll numbers indicate that he has n't really connected with the public .
that may change tonight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are having trouble distinguishing between the policies of the two main parties " what we have seen so far is that steinmeier is uncomfortable in the role of candidate , " manfred guellner , the head of polling firm forsa said .

" we went to and have stayed in afghanistan to prevent terrorist attacks , including against ourselves , " steinmeier told super illu magazine .
" but we do n't want to stay forever .
the aim , over the course of the next parliamentary period , is to lay the foundations for a withdrawal . "
the foreign minister refused , however , to give a definite deadline for when the soldiers are to be out .
" it would n't be prudent to inform terrorist forces of the precise year in which the last foreign soldier will have left afghanistan , " he said .
the announcement is a move that could win steinmeier votes in the upcoming september 27 elections when he 'll be running as the social democratic candidate against incumbent german chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats .
the german foreign minister said the timeline of the withdrawal would depend on the capabilities of the local afghan forces .
talks are needed " to determine how long we and other international soldiers will have to stay and how many more afghan soldiers and policemen have to be trained to take full charge of security . "
afghanistan is back on the election agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is also pushing for an early exit german chancellor angela merkel touched upon an early german withdrawal from afghanistan herself on saturday .
" in association with our partners , we want to hammer out a strategy allowing for the transfer of responsibility to afghanistan over five years , " merkel said in an interview published in saturday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
on sunday night , merkel and steinmeier are to face each other in a televised debate which may help to determine the outcome of the september 27 election .
polls show that around 60 percent of voters want an end to germany 's participation in the nato mission .
all of germany 's major parties , other than the far-left left party , have so far backed the deployment of german troops in northern afghanistan .
karzai commission confirms 30 civilian deaths a controversial airstrike called by german troops in afghanistan earlier this month that killed scores of people has brought the issue back into the election campaign .
on sunday , a commission set up by afghan president hamid karzai said that a total of 30 civilians and 69 taliban were killed in the airstrike .
but mohamadulla batai of the commission added that the responsibility for the tragedy remained with the taliban and defended the german officer who ordered the airstrike . " not only the german troops would have ordered the airstrikes , " batai said .
" all of the international and national forces would have acted likewise .
if these fuel trucks had remained in the hands of enemies , they would have used them for terrorist purposes . " germany , britain and france last week called for an international conference on afghanistan to be held by the end of the year to set new goals for the nato mission in the country. ai / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said the decision was " made with the intention of preventing significant danger , " to german , allied and afghan security forces . many german officials - including defense minister franz josef jung and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , both christian democrats - have already supported the decision to order the airstrike just over a week ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command there are vastly conflicting reports on the extent of casualties caused by the attack , but afghan authorities are investigating the incident more closely , along with nato .
german media reports suggest that at least some civilians were killed in the attack . with just weeks to go before the german general election , the unpopular afghan conflict has been catapulted into the midst of campaign season . " impressed " by colonel 's command schneiderhahn also said he visited colonel klein in afghanistan this spring , and had an in-depth discussion with the commander about the difficulties operating in afghanistan . " the professionalism with which our soldiers are acting , under constant threat and in an unsure situation , impressed me , " schneiderhahn said . however , the strike has come under criticism from some of germany 's nato allies , and colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command by ordering the airstrike . klein himself has welcomed the investigation into the attack in an interview with mass-circulation daily bild , describing such investigations into lethal military strikes as " necessary and correct .

' what next ? ' read the banners of the angry demonstrators .
it 's a question most spaniards are asking as the country continues to wallow in recession .
for while france and germany have staged quick recoveries , spain is lagging behind .
spanish daily el pais reported this summer that the spanish gdp would shrink 4.2 percent this year , while the central european bank has predicted that it will be mid-2010 before the country starts to register growth .
spain buffeted by economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero says recovery will be slow prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government has been forced to admit that unemployment will likely rise to 20 percent this year of the working population and that the deficit is set to reach 10 percent of gdp .
the country has shed 1.3 million jobs in the last year , while employment figures for august show that last month , another 85,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed - over 18 percent of the active population .
that puts spain 's joblessness at more than double the eu average , a development blamed largely on the collapse of the spanish housing market and the end of the construction boom .
as a result , government spending has escalated and zapatero has warned that next year 's budget will " be the most austere spain has seen in the recent years . "
last week , he told parliament that recovery will be slow .
" signs that the deterioration is slowing does not mean that a recovery is here or will be fast .
there are signs that the worst of the recession has passed , but we are still suffering an intense crisis , " he said .
wefare and green energy so what is his government doing to help spain weather the crisis ?
with over a million unemployed people without any form of government support , one focus is welfare .
keen to keep unions on its side in the face of dwindling public support , the government has agreed to pay 420 euros a month to those who have exhausted their social security quotas , backdated to january 2009 .
around 600,000 people will benefit from the scheme , but it will cost the government an extra 100 million euros per month .
meanwhile , to reactivate the economy , the government has announced a new finance model that has echoes of a green new deal .
spain 's debt-fuelled property boom paid scant attention to either environmental concerns or sustainability .
now , the government has announced a 25- illion-euro stimulus package to boost technological innovation , investments in renewables and energy efficiency .
it makes sense for spain to play to its strengths .
after all , the country provided for 35 percent of its energy needs in january 2009 with renewables - making a saving of 90 million euros on gas imports , according to the wwf energy observatory .
moderate and temporary as for plugging the 50-billion-euro public deficit , the government has floated a couple of ideas in the last week ahead of 2010 budget announcements , due to be passed on 18 september .
one is to freeze civil servants ' salaries , introduce cuts across the ministries , and another , more controversially , to raise taxes .
zapatero announced the move , without enthusiasm , last week : " we are going to look at capital income , not at wages , to ask for a small - and it 's going to be small - increase in the contribution to the public purse .
it 's going to be moderate and as far as we can manage it , temporary , " he said .
no more false hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood in spain is subdued whatever form they take , tax hikes are likely to be passed through pacting with the left .
the government 's socialist approach to the crisis has attracted scorn from the main government opposition , the conservative pp who have also accused them of erratic and improvised policy .
the government has also been accused of failing to admit to the extent of the damage .
until recently , ministers expressed overriding optimism - choosing to focus on improving consumer confidence , the madrid stockmarket 's positive performance and the fact that even though unemployment is increasing , the rate is slowing .
but even before zapatero finally spelt out the grim truth about spain 's prospects of recovery this week , a more realistic mood had been apparent in madrid .
in july , deputy prime minister and economics minister elena salgado conceded that the economic outlook was worse than had been acknowledged .
the new honesty might prove constructive .
shows of unity from government , unions and business leaders have kept demonstrations like that at the roca plant to a minimum so far .
but with fresh economic data emerging that shows spain is by no means out of the woods , the government can not afford to raise false hopes .

"
the coveted golden lion award went to israeli filmmaker samuel maoz . fatih akin 's comedy " soul kitchen " is a romantic comedy following the fortunes of a restaurant and its owner , a scruffy looking german-greek .
the food is n't exactly top-notch in his locals-only restaurant , but his clientele remain loyal . however , when zinos , played by adam bousdoukos , brings in a more talented chef to improve the menu , the local 's revolt is just the start of his problems . akin won the golden bear award at the 2004 berlinale film festival for his more serious film " head on , " and in 2007 another weightier film , " edge of heaven , " won him the screenplay award at cannes .
akin said he wanted to stretch his wings and try something new this year . " as a director , i want to make experiments , and i get bored with directors that make one style .
i want to change and go on testing my style .

" lebanon " by israeli director samuel maoz , is set during the first day of israel 's 1982 conflict in lebanon .
it is shot from the perspective of soldiers holed up in a tank , and clever cinematography forces the audience to share the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere . maoz said earlier in the week that he was so traumatized by his real-life experience as a young soldier during the lebanon war that it took him a quarter of a century to pluck up the courage to revisit his own past and make the movie . but bragging rights amongst the directors belong to iranian-born visual artist shirin neshat .
neshat won the silver lion award for best director for her film " women without men . "

controversial us director michael moore premiered his latest documentary entitled " capitalism : a love story , " and those familiar with his work will not be surprised to hear that the title is dripping with irony .
moore assaults wall street 's wheeling and dealing , blaming excessive financial speculation for the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the bankruptcy of major banks and companies like general motors . also , venezuelan president hugo chavez stole a little of the limelight on his european diplomatic tour .

" we went to and have stayed in afghanistan to prevent terrorist attacks , including against ourselves , " steinmeier told super illu magazine .
" but we do n't want to stay forever .
the aim , over the course of the next parliamentary period , is to lay the foundations for a withdrawal . "
the foreign minister refused , however , to give a definite deadline for when the soldiers are to be out .
" it would n't be prudent to inform terrorist forces of the precise year in which the last foreign soldier will have left afghanistan , " he said .
the announcement is a move that could win steinmeier votes in the upcoming september 27 elections when he 'll be running as the social democratic candidate against incumbent german chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats .
the german foreign minister said the timeline of the withdrawal would depend on the capabilities of the local afghan forces .
talks are needed " to determine how long we and other international soldiers will have to stay and how many more afghan soldiers and policemen have to be trained to take full charge of security . "
afghanistan is back on the election agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is also pushing for an early exit german chancellor angela merkel touched upon an early german withdrawal from afghanistan herself on saturday .
" in association with our partners , we want to hammer out a strategy allowing for the transfer of responsibility to afghanistan over five years , " merkel said in an interview published in saturday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
on sunday night , merkel and steinmeier are to face each other in a televised debate which may help to determine the outcome of the september 27 election .
polls show that around 60 percent of voters want an end to germany 's participation in the nato mission .
all of germany 's major parties , other than the far-left left party , have so far backed the deployment of german troops in northern afghanistan .
karzai commission confirms 30 civilian deaths a controversial airstrike called by german troops in afghanistan earlier this month that killed scores of people has brought the issue back into the election campaign .
on sunday , a commission set up by afghan president hamid karzai said that a total of 30 civilians and 69 taliban were killed in the airstrike .
but mohamadulla batai of the commission added that the responsibility for the tragedy remained with the taliban and defended the german officer who ordered the airstrike . " not only the german troops would have ordered the airstrikes , " batai said .

" we went to and have stayed in afghanistan to prevent terrorist attacks , including against ourselves , " steinmeier told super illu magazine .
" but we do n't want to stay forever .
the aim , over the course of the next parliamentary period , is to lay the foundations for a withdrawal . "
the foreign minister refused , however , to give a definite deadline for when the soldiers are to be out .
" it would n't be prudent to inform terrorist forces of the precise year in which the last foreign soldier will have left afghanistan , " he said .
the announcement is a move that could win steinmeier votes in the upcoming september 27 elections when he 'll be running as the social democratic candidate against incumbent german chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats .
the german foreign minister said the timeline of the withdrawal would depend on the capabilities of the local afghan forces .
talks are needed " to determine how long we and other international soldiers will have to stay and how many more afghan soldiers and policemen have to be trained to take full charge of security . "
afghanistan is back on the election agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is also pushing for an early exit german chancellor angela merkel touched upon an early german withdrawal from afghanistan herself on saturday .
" in association with our partners , we want to hammer out a strategy allowing for the transfer of responsibility to afghanistan over five years , " merkel said in an interview published in saturday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
on sunday night , merkel and steinmeier are to face each other in a televised debate which may help to determine the outcome of the september 27 election .
polls show that around 60 percent of voters want an end to germany 's participation in the nato mission .
all of germany 's major parties , other than the far-left left party , have so far backed the deployment of german troops in northern afghanistan .
karzai commission confirms 30 civilian deaths a controversial airstrike called by german troops in afghanistan earlier this month that killed scores of people has brought the issue back into the election campaign .
on sunday , a commission set up by afghan president hamid karzai said that a total of 30 civilians and 69 taliban were killed in the airstrike .
but mohamadulla batai of the commission added that the responsibility for the tragedy remained with the taliban and defended the german officer who ordered the airstrike . " not only the german troops would have ordered the airstrikes , " batai said .
" all of the international and national forces would have acted likewise .
if these fuel trucks had remained in the hands of enemies , they would have used them for terrorist purposes .

" he said the decision was " made with the intention of preventing significant danger , " to german , allied and afghan security forces . many german officials - including defense minister franz josef jung and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , both christian democrats - have already supported the decision to order the airstrike just over a week ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command there are vastly conflicting reports on the extent of casualties caused by the attack , but afghan authorities are investigating the incident more closely , along with nato .
german media reports suggest that at least some civilians were killed in the attack . with just weeks to go before the german general election , the unpopular afghan conflict has been catapulted into the midst of campaign season . " impressed " by colonel 's command schneiderhahn also said he visited colonel klein in afghanistan this spring , and had an in-depth discussion with the commander about the difficulties operating in afghanistan . " the professionalism with which our soldiers are acting , under constant threat and in an unsure situation , impressed me , " schneiderhahn said . however , the strike has come under criticism from some of germany 's nato allies , and colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command by ordering the airstrike . klein himself has welcomed the investigation into the attack in an interview with mass-circulation daily bild , describing such investigations into lethal military strikes as " necessary and correct .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command there are vastly conflicting reports on the extent of casualties caused by the attack , but afghan authorities are investigating the incident more closely , along with nato .
german media reports suggest that at least some civilians were killed in the attack . with just weeks to go before the german general election , the unpopular afghan conflict has been catapulted into the midst of campaign season . " impressed " by colonel 's command schneiderhahn also said he visited colonel klein in afghanistan this spring , and had an in-depth discussion with the commander about the difficulties operating in afghanistan . " the professionalism with which our soldiers are acting , under constant threat and in an unsure situation , impressed me , " schneiderhahn said . however , the strike has come under criticism from some of germany 's nato allies , and colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command by ordering the airstrike . klein himself has welcomed the investigation into the attack in an interview with mass-circulation daily bild , describing such investigations into lethal military strikes as " necessary and correct . " " every isaf soldier or civilian killed in afghanistan is one too many , " klein said . msh / dpa / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said the decision was " made with the intention of preventing significant danger , " to german , allied and afghan security forces . many german officials - including defense minister franz josef jung and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , both christian democrats - have already supported the decision to order the airstrike just over a week ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command there are vastly conflicting reports on the extent of casualties caused by the attack , but afghan authorities are investigating the incident more closely , along with nato .
german media reports suggest that at least some civilians were killed in the attack . with just weeks to go before the german general election , the unpopular afghan conflict has been catapulted into the midst of campaign season . " impressed " by colonel 's command schneiderhahn also said he visited colonel klein in afghanistan this spring , and had an in-depth discussion with the commander about the difficulties operating in afghanistan . " the professionalism with which our soldiers are acting , under constant threat and in an unsure situation , impressed me , " schneiderhahn said . however , the strike has come under criticism from some of germany 's nato allies , and colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command by ordering the airstrike . klein himself has welcomed the investigation into the attack in an interview with mass-circulation daily bild , describing such investigations into lethal military strikes as " necessary and correct .

"
the coveted golden lion award went to israeli filmmaker samuel maoz . fatih akin 's comedy " soul kitchen " is a romantic comedy following the fortunes of a restaurant and its owner , a scruffy looking german-greek .
the food is n't exactly top-notch in his locals-only restaurant , but his clientele remain loyal . however , when zinos , played by adam bousdoukos , brings in a more talented chef to improve the menu , the local 's revolt is just the start of his problems . akin won the golden bear award at the 2004 berlinale film festival for his more serious film " head on , " and in 2007 another weightier film , " edge of heaven , " won him the screenplay award at cannes .
akin said he wanted to stretch his wings and try something new this year . " as a director , i want to make experiments , and i get bored with directors that make one style .
i want to change and go on testing my style . " war dramas clinch big prizes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian director shirin neshat scooped the best director award however , it was an entirely serious film that won the coveted golden lion prize for best film , the award that akin was really eyeing with soul kitchen . " lebanon " by israeli director samuel maoz , is set during the first day of israel 's 1982 conflict in lebanon .
it is shot from the perspective of soldiers holed up in a tank , and clever cinematography forces the audience to share the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere . maoz said earlier in the week that he was so traumatized by his real-life experience as a young soldier during the lebanon war that it took him a quarter of a century to pluck up the courage to revisit his own past and make the movie . but bragging rights amongst the directors belong to iranian-born visual artist shirin neshat .
neshat won the silver lion award for best director for her film " women without men . "
the tale follows the fate of four women during iran 's 1953 cia-backed coup d 'etat . honorable mentions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore released " capitalism : a love story " in venice russia 's ksenia rappoport won the coppa volpi prize for best actress , for her role as a waitress who meets a former policeman on a speed date in the italian noir thriller , " la doppia ora . "
britain 's colin firth won the best actor prize , for his portrayal of a discreet university professor coming to terms with the death of his gay lover in " a single man . " meanwhile , the festival stole the headlines primarily for its political flavor this year .
controversial us director michael moore premiered his latest documentary entitled " capitalism : a love story , " and those familiar with his work will not be surprised to hear that the title is dripping with irony .
moore assaults wall street 's wheeling and dealing , blaming excessive financial speculation for the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the bankruptcy of major banks and companies like general motors . also , venezuelan president hugo chavez stole a little of the limelight on his european diplomatic tour .
earlier in the week the controversial latin american leader attended the premiere of oliver stone 's " south of the border " - a movie condemning what it portrays as a us smear campaign against venezuela 's socialist leader . the awards ceremony on saturday marked the end of the 66th venice film festival , the world 's oldest silver screen celebration. msh / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 13.09.2009 opel sale sparks widespread criticism in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel logo may lose some of its sheen if critics are proved right gm 's planned sale of carmaker opel to supplier magna has been welcomed by top german politicians .
but elsewhere criticism of the deal is growing amid reports of unfair competition and greater job losses than expected . with federal elections just two weeks away , top-ranking german politicians are celebrating general motors ' decision to sell ailing carmaker opel to canadian-austrian car parts maker magna .
the deal is seen in germany as a coup for chancellor angela merkel whose government had pressed hard for gm to choose a consortium of magna and sberbank of russia , offering 4.5 billion euros in german taxpayers ' money .
but the euphoria may be short-lived if a report in news magazine der spiegel is confirmed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to germany , opel employs thousands in other european nations the magazine said on saturday that magna plans to lay off more employees in germany than previously thought .
on top of 3,000 jobs in the production lines , another 1,100 are to be scrapped in the administration , it said .
the magna deal was favored in germany as it promised to preserve more jobs than rival bidder rhj international .
around half of gm 's 50,000 strong european work force is based in germany and opel 's new owners have pledged to keep open its four main plants in the country .
but the carmaker also employs thousands in spain , britain , belgium , italy , austria and france .
and fears are now growing that the new owners , magna and sberbank of russia , might axe jobs in other european sites in a bid to minimize losses in germany .
gm vice-president john smith said in berlin this week that opel 's new owners were " contemplating " winding down a plant in antwerp , belgium , and shifting some production from spain to germany .
state negotiator slams opel deal making matters more complicated for chancellor angela merkel 's government , the representative of the german federal states at the opel negotiations , dirk pfeil , also described the opel sale to magna as a " serious mistake . "
in an interview with radio station deutschlandfunk on saturday , pfeil said had he would not have taken part in the discussions had he “ known that it was going to be a purely political decision , and that business management considerations would be left in the shadows . ”
“ it is unique in my professional life that the party which has been acting as guarantor also decides on the buyer .
that is a bit odd and it does not fit into the system , " pfeil said .
eu warns of action against protectionism general motors announced this week it will sell 55 percent of its european subsidiary opel to magna and its russian partner bank sberbank and carmaker gaz .
gm will only retain a minority stake of 35 percent , while ten percent is to be held by opel employees .
the opel sale to magna has also attracted the interest of the european commission .
on saturday , european union competition commissioner neelie kroes warned she will take action if there is any protectionism in the sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes has warned of tough action if any protectionism is detected in the opel deal the belgian government says it wants the eu commission to investigate the opel deal amid concern that germany allegedly sought to protect its own plants at the cost of others .
kroes was quoted as saying saturday that " if something happens against the rules , i will take action . "
kroes added that state support should not be tied to factory locations .
merkel denies deal was politically motivated chancellor merkel on saturday however dismissed fears that the eu commission could put the brakes on the deals or block berlin 's package of government aid for opel .
in the sueddeutsche newspaper , she pointed out that the general framework of government aid from which the billions for opel are to come have already been approved by the commission .
there 's also criticism from within germany that berlin 's pressure on gm to favor magna was mostly politically motivated .
with general elections coming up on sept .
27 , the two parties in the current grand coalition needed a quick solution to the opel problem and a solution with as little job cuts within germany as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism has put chancellor merkel on the defensive analysts warn , however , that the true cost of the deal and more details about layoffs will be known only after the general election .
chancellor merkel on saturday dismissed that the opel rescue was politically motivated .
" we are not rescuing corporations , but are maintaining a chance for them in the financial crisis , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" but of course the company needs a solid concept for the future .
any company then has to prove itself on the market , there 's no way that the government can take off that pressure . " ai / dpa / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it would n't be prudent to inform terrorist forces of the precise year in which the last foreign soldier will have left afghanistan , " he said .
the announcement is a move that could win steinmeier votes in the upcoming september 27 elections when he 'll be running as the social democratic candidate against incumbent german chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats .

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .
a recent poll puts steinmeier 's social democrats at 23 percent , far behind merkel 's conservatives on 36 percent . this is steinmeier 's first run at higher office and his poll numbers indicate that he has n't really connected with the public .
that may change tonight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are having trouble distinguishing between the policies of the two main parties " what we have seen so far is that steinmeier is uncomfortable in the role of candidate , " manfred guellner , the head of polling firm forsa said .
" it will be tough to score points against merkel , who has gained a lot of experience with public events like this . " tough , but not impossible .
a large swing in voter opinion is not unheard of in german politics . back in 2002 , in a debate between gerhard schroeder and edmund stoiber , schroeder hammered stoiber on iraq and turned a likely defeat for the spd into a victory . merkel has the upper hand chancellor merkel , could benefit from tonight 's debate in a couple of ways .
by holding her own , or even impressing the voters , she could stop the erosion of support for her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in recent weeks . despite the conservatives ' lead over the spd , it is far from certain whether merkel will win enough votes to form a coalition with her desired partners , the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . nearly two-thirds of germans -lrb- 64 percent -rrb- believe merkel will " win " sunday 's debate , compared to only 15 percent who think steinmeier will triumph , according to a poll for ard public television. av / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the coveted golden lion award went to israeli filmmaker samuel maoz . fatih akin 's comedy " soul kitchen " is a romantic comedy following the fortunes of a restaurant and its owner , a scruffy looking german-greek .
the food is n't exactly top-notch in his locals-only restaurant , but his clientele remain loyal . however , when zinos , played by adam bousdoukos , brings in a more talented chef to improve the menu , the local 's revolt is just the start of his problems . akin won the golden bear award at the 2004 berlinale film festival for his more serious film " head on , " and in 2007 another weightier film , " edge of heaven , " won him the screenplay award at cannes .
akin said he wanted to stretch his wings and try something new this year . " as a director , i want to make experiments , and i get bored with directors that make one style .
i want to change and go on testing my style . " war dramas clinch big prizes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian director shirin neshat scooped the best director award however , it was an entirely serious film that won the coveted golden lion prize for best film , the award that akin was really eyeing with soul kitchen . " lebanon " by israeli director samuel maoz , is set during the first day of israel 's 1982 conflict in lebanon .
it is shot from the perspective of soldiers holed up in a tank , and clever cinematography forces the audience to share the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere . maoz said earlier in the week that he was so traumatized by his real-life experience as a young soldier during the lebanon war that it took him a quarter of a century to pluck up the courage to revisit his own past and make the movie . but bragging rights amongst the directors belong to iranian-born visual artist shirin neshat .
neshat won the silver lion award for best director for her film " women without men . "

moore assaults wall street 's wheeling and dealing , blaming excessive financial speculation for the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the bankruptcy of major banks and companies like general motors . also , venezuelan president hugo chavez stole a little of the limelight on his european diplomatic tour .

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .
a recent poll puts steinmeier 's social democrats at 23 percent , far behind merkel 's conservatives on 36 percent . this is steinmeier 's first run at higher office and his poll numbers indicate that he has n't really connected with the public .
that may change tonight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are having trouble distinguishing between the policies of the two main parties " what we have seen so far is that steinmeier is uncomfortable in the role of candidate , " manfred guellner , the head of polling firm forsa said .
" it will be tough to score points against merkel , who has gained a lot of experience with public events like this . " tough , but not impossible .
a large swing in voter opinion is not unheard of in german politics . back in 2002 , in a debate between gerhard schroeder and edmund stoiber , schroeder hammered stoiber on iraq and turned a likely defeat for the spd into a victory . merkel has the upper hand chancellor merkel , could benefit from tonight 's debate in a couple of ways .

" we went to and have stayed in afghanistan to prevent terrorist attacks , including against ourselves , " steinmeier told super illu magazine .
" but we do n't want to stay forever .
the aim , over the course of the next parliamentary period , is to lay the foundations for a withdrawal . "
the foreign minister refused , however , to give a definite deadline for when the soldiers are to be out .
" it would n't be prudent to inform terrorist forces of the precise year in which the last foreign soldier will have left afghanistan , " he said .
the announcement is a move that could win steinmeier votes in the upcoming september 27 elections when he 'll be running as the social democratic candidate against incumbent german chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats .
the german foreign minister said the timeline of the withdrawal would depend on the capabilities of the local afghan forces .
talks are needed " to determine how long we and other international soldiers will have to stay and how many more afghan soldiers and policemen have to be trained to take full charge of security . "
afghanistan is back on the election agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is also pushing for an early exit german chancellor angela merkel touched upon an early german withdrawal from afghanistan herself on saturday .
" in association with our partners , we want to hammer out a strategy allowing for the transfer of responsibility to afghanistan over five years , " merkel said in an interview published in saturday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
on sunday night , merkel and steinmeier are to face each other in a televised debate which may help to determine the outcome of the september 27 election .
polls show that around 60 percent of voters want an end to germany 's participation in the nato mission .
all of germany 's major parties , other than the far-left left party , have so far backed the deployment of german troops in northern afghanistan .
karzai commission confirms 30 civilian deaths a controversial airstrike called by german troops in afghanistan earlier this month that killed scores of people has brought the issue back into the election campaign .
on sunday , a commission set up by afghan president hamid karzai said that a total of 30 civilians and 69 taliban were killed in the airstrike .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 13.09.2009 opel sale sparks widespread criticism in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel logo may lose some of its sheen if critics are proved right gm 's planned sale of carmaker opel to supplier magna has been welcomed by top german politicians .
but elsewhere criticism of the deal is growing amid reports of unfair competition and greater job losses than expected . with federal elections just two weeks away , top-ranking german politicians are celebrating general motors ' decision to sell ailing carmaker opel to canadian-austrian car parts maker magna .
the deal is seen in germany as a coup for chancellor angela merkel whose government had pressed hard for gm to choose a consortium of magna and sberbank of russia , offering 4.5 billion euros in german taxpayers ' money .
but the euphoria may be short-lived if a report in news magazine der spiegel is confirmed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to germany , opel employs thousands in other european nations the magazine said on saturday that magna plans to lay off more employees in germany than previously thought .
on top of 3,000 jobs in the production lines , another 1,100 are to be scrapped in the administration , it said .
the magna deal was favored in germany as it promised to preserve more jobs than rival bidder rhj international .
around half of gm 's 50,000 strong european work force is based in germany and opel 's new owners have pledged to keep open its four main plants in the country .
but the carmaker also employs thousands in spain , britain , belgium , italy , austria and france .
and fears are now growing that the new owners , magna and sberbank of russia , might axe jobs in other european sites in a bid to minimize losses in germany .
gm vice-president john smith said in berlin this week that opel 's new owners were " contemplating " winding down a plant in antwerp , belgium , and shifting some production from spain to germany .
state negotiator slams opel deal making matters more complicated for chancellor angela merkel 's government , the representative of the german federal states at the opel negotiations , dirk pfeil , also described the opel sale to magna as a " serious mistake . "
in an interview with radio station deutschlandfunk on saturday , pfeil said had he would not have taken part in the discussions had he “ known that it was going to be a purely political decision , and that business management considerations would be left in the shadows . ”
“ it is unique in my professional life that the party which has been acting as guarantor also decides on the buyer .
that is a bit odd and it does not fit into the system , " pfeil said .
eu warns of action against protectionism general motors announced this week it will sell 55 percent of its european subsidiary opel to magna and its russian partner bank sberbank and carmaker gaz .
gm will only retain a minority stake of 35 percent , while ten percent is to be held by opel employees .
the opel sale to magna has also attracted the interest of the european commission .
on saturday , european union competition commissioner neelie kroes warned she will take action if there is any protectionism in the sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes has warned of tough action if any protectionism is detected in the opel deal the belgian government says it wants the eu commission to investigate the opel deal amid concern that germany allegedly sought to protect its own plants at the cost of others .
kroes was quoted as saying saturday that " if something happens against the rules , i will take action . "
kroes added that state support should not be tied to factory locations .
merkel denies deal was politically motivated chancellor merkel on saturday however dismissed fears that the eu commission could put the brakes on the deals or block berlin 's package of government aid for opel .
in the sueddeutsche newspaper , she pointed out that the general framework of government aid from which the billions for opel are to come have already been approved by the commission .
there 's also criticism from within germany that berlin 's pressure on gm to favor magna was mostly politically motivated .
with general elections coming up on sept .
27 , the two parties in the current grand coalition needed a quick solution to the opel problem and a solution with as little job cuts within germany as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism has put chancellor merkel on the defensive analysts warn , however , that the true cost of the deal and more details about layoffs will be known only after the general election .
chancellor merkel on saturday dismissed that the opel rescue was politically motivated .
" we are not rescuing corporations , but are maintaining a chance for them in the financial crisis , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" but of course the company needs a solid concept for the future .
any company then has to prove itself on the market , there 's no way that the government can take off that pressure . " ai / dpa / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .
a recent poll puts steinmeier 's social democrats at 23 percent , far behind merkel 's conservatives on 36 percent . this is steinmeier 's first run at higher office and his poll numbers indicate that he has n't really connected with the public .
that may change tonight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are having trouble distinguishing between the policies of the two main parties " what we have seen so far is that steinmeier is uncomfortable in the role of candidate , " manfred guellner , the head of polling firm forsa said .
" it will be tough to score points against merkel , who has gained a lot of experience with public events like this . " tough , but not impossible .
a large swing in voter opinion is not unheard of in german politics . back in 2002 , in a debate between gerhard schroeder and edmund stoiber , schroeder hammered stoiber on iraq and turned a likely defeat for the spd into a victory . merkel has the upper hand chancellor merkel , could benefit from tonight 's debate in a couple of ways .
by holding her own , or even impressing the voters , she could stop the erosion of support for her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in recent weeks . despite the conservatives ' lead over the spd , it is far from certain whether merkel will win enough votes to form a coalition with her desired partners , the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . nearly two-thirds of germans -lrb- 64 percent -rrb- believe merkel will " win " sunday 's debate , compared to only 15 percent who think steinmeier will triumph , according to a poll for ard public television. av / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 13.09.2009 opel sale sparks widespread criticism in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel logo may lose some of its sheen if critics are proved right gm 's planned sale of carmaker opel to supplier magna has been welcomed by top german politicians .
but elsewhere criticism of the deal is growing amid reports of unfair competition and greater job losses than expected . with federal elections just two weeks away , top-ranking german politicians are celebrating general motors ' decision to sell ailing carmaker opel to canadian-austrian car parts maker magna .
the deal is seen in germany as a coup for chancellor angela merkel whose government had pressed hard for gm to choose a consortium of magna and sberbank of russia , offering 4.5 billion euros in german taxpayers ' money .
but the euphoria may be short-lived if a report in news magazine der spiegel is confirmed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to germany , opel employs thousands in other european nations the magazine said on saturday that magna plans to lay off more employees in germany than previously thought .
on top of 3,000 jobs in the production lines , another 1,100 are to be scrapped in the administration , it said .
the magna deal was favored in germany as it promised to preserve more jobs than rival bidder rhj international .
around half of gm 's 50,000 strong european work force is based in germany and opel 's new owners have pledged to keep open its four main plants in the country .
but the carmaker also employs thousands in spain , britain , belgium , italy , austria and france .
and fears are now growing that the new owners , magna and sberbank of russia , might axe jobs in other european sites in a bid to minimize losses in germany .
gm vice-president john smith said in berlin this week that opel 's new owners were " contemplating " winding down a plant in antwerp , belgium , and shifting some production from spain to germany .
state negotiator slams opel deal making matters more complicated for chancellor angela merkel 's government , the representative of the german federal states at the opel negotiations , dirk pfeil , also described the opel sale to magna as a " serious mistake . "
in an interview with radio station deutschlandfunk on saturday , pfeil said had he would not have taken part in the discussions had he “ known that it was going to be a purely political decision , and that business management considerations would be left in the shadows . ”
“ it is unique in my professional life that the party which has been acting as guarantor also decides on the buyer .
that is a bit odd and it does not fit into the system , " pfeil said .
eu warns of action against protectionism general motors announced this week it will sell 55 percent of its european subsidiary opel to magna and its russian partner bank sberbank and carmaker gaz .
gm will only retain a minority stake of 35 percent , while ten percent is to be held by opel employees .
the opel sale to magna has also attracted the interest of the european commission .

" we went to and have stayed in afghanistan to prevent terrorist attacks , including against ourselves , " steinmeier told super illu magazine .
" but we do n't want to stay forever .
the aim , over the course of the next parliamentary period , is to lay the foundations for a withdrawal . "
the foreign minister refused , however , to give a definite deadline for when the soldiers are to be out .
" it would n't be prudent to inform terrorist forces of the precise year in which the last foreign soldier will have left afghanistan , " he said .
the announcement is a move that could win steinmeier votes in the upcoming september 27 elections when he 'll be running as the social democratic candidate against incumbent german chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats .
the german foreign minister said the timeline of the withdrawal would depend on the capabilities of the local afghan forces .
talks are needed " to determine how long we and other international soldiers will have to stay and how many more afghan soldiers and policemen have to be trained to take full charge of security . "
afghanistan is back on the election agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is also pushing for an early exit german chancellor angela merkel touched upon an early german withdrawal from afghanistan herself on saturday .
" in association with our partners , we want to hammer out a strategy allowing for the transfer of responsibility to afghanistan over five years , " merkel said in an interview published in saturday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
on sunday night , merkel and steinmeier are to face each other in a televised debate which may help to determine the outcome of the september 27 election .
polls show that around 60 percent of voters want an end to germany 's participation in the nato mission .
all of germany 's major parties , other than the far-left left party , have so far backed the deployment of german troops in northern afghanistan .
karzai commission confirms 30 civilian deaths a controversial airstrike called by german troops in afghanistan earlier this month that killed scores of people has brought the issue back into the election campaign .
on sunday , a commission set up by afghan president hamid karzai said that a total of 30 civilians and 69 taliban were killed in the airstrike .
but mohamadulla batai of the commission added that the responsibility for the tragedy remained with the taliban and defended the german officer who ordered the airstrike . " not only the german troops would have ordered the airstrikes , " batai said .
" all of the international and national forces would have acted likewise .
if these fuel trucks had remained in the hands of enemies , they would have used them for terrorist purposes . " germany , britain and france last week called for an international conference on afghanistan to be held by the end of the year to set new goals for the nato mission in the country. ai / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .
a recent poll puts steinmeier 's social democrats at 23 percent , far behind merkel 's conservatives on 36 percent . this is steinmeier 's first run at higher office and his poll numbers indicate that he has n't really connected with the public .
that may change tonight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are having trouble distinguishing between the policies of the two main parties " what we have seen so far is that steinmeier is uncomfortable in the role of candidate , " manfred guellner , the head of polling firm forsa said .
" it will be tough to score points against merkel , who has gained a lot of experience with public events like this . " tough , but not impossible .
a large swing in voter opinion is not unheard of in german politics . back in 2002 , in a debate between gerhard schroeder and edmund stoiber , schroeder hammered stoiber on iraq and turned a likely defeat for the spd into a victory . merkel has the upper hand chancellor merkel , could benefit from tonight 's debate in a couple of ways .
by holding her own , or even impressing the voters , she could stop the erosion of support for her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in recent weeks . despite the conservatives ' lead over the spd , it is far from certain whether merkel will win enough votes to form a coalition with her desired partners , the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . nearly two-thirds of germans -lrb- 64 percent -rrb- believe merkel will " win " sunday 's debate , compared to only 15 percent who think steinmeier will triumph , according to a poll for ard public television. av / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.09.2009 still in slump , spain explores solutions to economic crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was brought to its knees when its property market collapsed with a public deficit nudging 10 percent of gdp , spain 's government is testing the waters on a series of recovery measures - from improved social protection to green stimulus . last week saw workers across spain protest at layoffs from the factories of bathroom manufacturer roca .
' what next ? ' read the banners of the angry demonstrators .
it 's a question most spaniards are asking as the country continues to wallow in recession .
for while france and germany have staged quick recoveries , spain is lagging behind .
spanish daily el pais reported this summer that the spanish gdp would shrink 4.2 percent this year , while the central european bank has predicted that it will be mid-2010 before the country starts to register growth .
spain buffeted by economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero says recovery will be slow prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government has been forced to admit that unemployment will likely rise to 20 percent this year of the working population and that the deficit is set to reach 10 percent of gdp .
the country has shed 1.3 million jobs in the last year , while employment figures for august show that last month , another 85,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed - over 18 percent of the active population .
that puts spain 's joblessness at more than double the eu average , a development blamed largely on the collapse of the spanish housing market and the end of the construction boom .
as a result , government spending has escalated and zapatero has warned that next year 's budget will " be the most austere spain has seen in the recent years . "
last week , he told parliament that recovery will be slow .
" signs that the deterioration is slowing does not mean that a recovery is here or will be fast .
there are signs that the worst of the recession has passed , but we are still suffering an intense crisis , " he said .
wefare and green energy so what is his government doing to help spain weather the crisis ?
with over a million unemployed people without any form of government support , one focus is welfare .
keen to keep unions on its side in the face of dwindling public support , the government has agreed to pay 420 euros a month to those who have exhausted their social security quotas , backdated to january 2009 .
around 600,000 people will benefit from the scheme , but it will cost the government an extra 100 million euros per month .
meanwhile , to reactivate the economy , the government has announced a new finance model that has echoes of a green new deal .
spain 's debt-fuelled property boom paid scant attention to either environmental concerns or sustainability .
now , the government has announced a 25- illion-euro stimulus package to boost technological innovation , investments in renewables and energy efficiency .
it makes sense for spain to play to its strengths .
after all , the country provided for 35 percent of its energy needs in january 2009 with renewables - making a saving of 90 million euros on gas imports , according to the wwf energy observatory .
moderate and temporary as for plugging the 50-billion-euro public deficit , the government has floated a couple of ideas in the last week ahead of 2010 budget announcements , due to be passed on 18 september .
one is to freeze civil servants ' salaries , introduce cuts across the ministries , and another , more controversially , to raise taxes .
zapatero announced the move , without enthusiasm , last week : " we are going to look at capital income , not at wages , to ask for a small - and it 's going to be small - increase in the contribution to the public purse .
it 's going to be moderate and as far as we can manage it , temporary , " he said .
no more false hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood in spain is subdued whatever form they take , tax hikes are likely to be passed through pacting with the left .
the government 's socialist approach to the crisis has attracted scorn from the main government opposition , the conservative pp who have also accused them of erratic and improvised policy .
the government has also been accused of failing to admit to the extent of the damage .
until recently , ministers expressed overriding optimism - choosing to focus on improving consumer confidence , the madrid stockmarket 's positive performance and the fact that even though unemployment is increasing , the rate is slowing .
but even before zapatero finally spelt out the grim truth about spain 's prospects of recovery this week , a more realistic mood had been apparent in madrid .
in july , deputy prime minister and economics minister elena salgado conceded that the economic outlook was worse than had been acknowledged .
the new honesty might prove constructive .
shows of unity from government , unions and business leaders have kept demonstrations like that at the roca plant to a minimum so far .
but with fresh economic data emerging that shows spain is by no means out of the woods , the government can not afford to raise false hopes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.09.2009 still in slump , spain explores solutions to economic crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was brought to its knees when its property market collapsed with a public deficit nudging 10 percent of gdp , spain 's government is testing the waters on a series of recovery measures - from improved social protection to green stimulus . last week saw workers across spain protest at layoffs from the factories of bathroom manufacturer roca .
' what next ? ' read the banners of the angry demonstrators .
it 's a question most spaniards are asking as the country continues to wallow in recession .
for while france and germany have staged quick recoveries , spain is lagging behind .
spanish daily el pais reported this summer that the spanish gdp would shrink 4.2 percent this year , while the central european bank has predicted that it will be mid-2010 before the country starts to register growth .
spain buffeted by economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero says recovery will be slow prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government has been forced to admit that unemployment will likely rise to 20 percent this year of the working population and that the deficit is set to reach 10 percent of gdp .
the country has shed 1.3 million jobs in the last year , while employment figures for august show that last month , another 85,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed - over 18 percent of the active population .
that puts spain 's joblessness at more than double the eu average , a development blamed largely on the collapse of the spanish housing market and the end of the construction boom .
as a result , government spending has escalated and zapatero has warned that next year 's budget will " be the most austere spain has seen in the recent years . "
last week , he told parliament that recovery will be slow .
" signs that the deterioration is slowing does not mean that a recovery is here or will be fast .
there are signs that the worst of the recession has passed , but we are still suffering an intense crisis , " he said .
wefare and green energy so what is his government doing to help spain weather the crisis ?
with over a million unemployed people without any form of government support , one focus is welfare .
keen to keep unions on its side in the face of dwindling public support , the government has agreed to pay 420 euros a month to those who have exhausted their social security quotas , backdated to january 2009 .
around 600,000 people will benefit from the scheme , but it will cost the government an extra 100 million euros per month .
meanwhile , to reactivate the economy , the government has announced a new finance model that has echoes of a green new deal .
spain 's debt-fuelled property boom paid scant attention to either environmental concerns or sustainability .
now , the government has announced a 25- illion-euro stimulus package to boost technological innovation , investments in renewables and energy efficiency .
it makes sense for spain to play to its strengths .
after all , the country provided for 35 percent of its energy needs in january 2009 with renewables - making a saving of 90 million euros on gas imports , according to the wwf energy observatory .
moderate and temporary as for plugging the 50-billion-euro public deficit , the government has floated a couple of ideas in the last week ahead of 2010 budget announcements , due to be passed on 18 september .
one is to freeze civil servants ' salaries , introduce cuts across the ministries , and another , more controversially , to raise taxes .
zapatero announced the move , without enthusiasm , last week : " we are going to look at capital income , not at wages , to ask for a small - and it 's going to be small - increase in the contribution to the public purse .
it 's going to be moderate and as far as we can manage it , temporary , " he said .
no more false hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood in spain is subdued whatever form they take , tax hikes are likely to be passed through pacting with the left .
the government 's socialist approach to the crisis has attracted scorn from the main government opposition , the conservative pp who have also accused them of erratic and improvised policy .
the government has also been accused of failing to admit to the extent of the damage .
until recently , ministers expressed overriding optimism - choosing to focus on improving consumer confidence , the madrid stockmarket 's positive performance and the fact that even though unemployment is increasing , the rate is slowing .
but even before zapatero finally spelt out the grim truth about spain 's prospects of recovery this week , a more realistic mood had been apparent in madrid .
in july , deputy prime minister and economics minister elena salgado conceded that the economic outlook was worse than had been acknowledged .
the new honesty might prove constructive .
shows of unity from government , unions and business leaders have kept demonstrations like that at the roca plant to a minimum so far .
but with fresh economic data emerging that shows spain is by no means out of the woods , the government can not afford to raise false hopes .

dw-world.de is the fiesta over for spain 's tourism industry ?

" we went to and have stayed in afghanistan to prevent terrorist attacks , including against ourselves , " steinmeier told super illu magazine .
" but we do n't want to stay forever .
the aim , over the course of the next parliamentary period , is to lay the foundations for a withdrawal . "
the foreign minister refused , however , to give a definite deadline for when the soldiers are to be out .
" it would n't be prudent to inform terrorist forces of the precise year in which the last foreign soldier will have left afghanistan , " he said .
the announcement is a move that could win steinmeier votes in the upcoming september 27 elections when he 'll be running as the social democratic candidate against incumbent german chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats .
the german foreign minister said the timeline of the withdrawal would depend on the capabilities of the local afghan forces .
talks are needed " to determine how long we and other international soldiers will have to stay and how many more afghan soldiers and policemen have to be trained to take full charge of security . "
afghanistan is back on the election agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is also pushing for an early exit german chancellor angela merkel touched upon an early german withdrawal from afghanistan herself on saturday .

karzai commission confirms 30 civilian deaths a controversial airstrike called by german troops in afghanistan earlier this month that killed scores of people has brought the issue back into the election campaign .
on sunday , a commission set up by afghan president hamid karzai said that a total of 30 civilians and 69 taliban were killed in the airstrike .
but mohamadulla batai of the commission added that the responsibility for the tragedy remained with the taliban and defended the german officer who ordered the airstrike . " not only the german troops would have ordered the airstrikes , " batai said .
" all of the international and national forces would have acted likewise .
if these fuel trucks had remained in the hands of enemies , they would have used them for terrorist purposes .

' what next ? ' read the banners of the angry demonstrators .
it 's a question most spaniards are asking as the country continues to wallow in recession .
for while france and germany have staged quick recoveries , spain is lagging behind .
spanish daily el pais reported this summer that the spanish gdp would shrink 4.2 percent this year , while the central european bank has predicted that it will be mid-2010 before the country starts to register growth .
spain buffeted by economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero says recovery will be slow prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government has been forced to admit that unemployment will likely rise to 20 percent this year of the working population and that the deficit is set to reach 10 percent of gdp .
the country has shed 1.3 million jobs in the last year , while employment figures for august show that last month , another 85,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed - over 18 percent of the active population .
that puts spain 's joblessness at more than double the eu average , a development blamed largely on the collapse of the spanish housing market and the end of the construction boom .
as a result , government spending has escalated and zapatero has warned that next year 's budget will " be the most austere spain has seen in the recent years . "
last week , he told parliament that recovery will be slow .
" signs that the deterioration is slowing does not mean that a recovery is here or will be fast .
there are signs that the worst of the recession has passed , but we are still suffering an intense crisis , " he said .
wefare and green energy so what is his government doing to help spain weather the crisis ?
with over a million unemployed people without any form of government support , one focus is welfare .
keen to keep unions on its side in the face of dwindling public support , the government has agreed to pay 420 euros a month to those who have exhausted their social security quotas , backdated to january 2009 .
around 600,000 people will benefit from the scheme , but it will cost the government an extra 100 million euros per month .
meanwhile , to reactivate the economy , the government has announced a new finance model that has echoes of a green new deal .
spain 's debt-fuelled property boom paid scant attention to either environmental concerns or sustainability .
now , the government has announced a 25- illion-euro stimulus package to boost technological innovation , investments in renewables and energy efficiency .
it makes sense for spain to play to its strengths .
after all , the country provided for 35 percent of its energy needs in january 2009 with renewables - making a saving of 90 million euros on gas imports , according to the wwf energy observatory .
moderate and temporary as for plugging the 50-billion-euro public deficit , the government has floated a couple of ideas in the last week ahead of 2010 budget announcements , due to be passed on 18 september .
one is to freeze civil servants ' salaries , introduce cuts across the ministries , and another , more controversially , to raise taxes .
zapatero announced the move , without enthusiasm , last week : " we are going to look at capital income , not at wages , to ask for a small - and it 's going to be small - increase in the contribution to the public purse .
it 's going to be moderate and as far as we can manage it , temporary , " he said .
no more false hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood in spain is subdued whatever form they take , tax hikes are likely to be passed through pacting with the left .
the government 's socialist approach to the crisis has attracted scorn from the main government opposition , the conservative pp who have also accused them of erratic and improvised policy .
the government has also been accused of failing to admit to the extent of the damage .
until recently , ministers expressed overriding optimism - choosing to focus on improving consumer confidence , the madrid stockmarket 's positive performance and the fact that even though unemployment is increasing , the rate is slowing .
but even before zapatero finally spelt out the grim truth about spain 's prospects of recovery this week , a more realistic mood had been apparent in madrid .
in july , deputy prime minister and economics minister elena salgado conceded that the economic outlook was worse than had been acknowledged .
the new honesty might prove constructive .
shows of unity from government , unions and business leaders have kept demonstrations like that at the roca plant to a minimum so far .
but with fresh economic data emerging that shows spain is by no means out of the woods , the government can not afford to raise false hopes .

kroes added that state support should not be tied to factory locations .
merkel denies deal was politically motivated chancellor merkel on saturday however dismissed fears that the eu commission could put the brakes on the deals or block berlin 's package of government aid for opel .

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .
we can only hope they want to , we can not order them to , " kloeppel said in an interview with daily nuremburger zeitung , adding " it 's a duel , not a wild shootout . " but some experts warn not to expect too much from the debate . " here come two people from the same government to tell us how it all went - not very exciting , " claus leggewie from the institute for advanced study in the humanities told the waz daily . media expert hans-hermann tiedje said people would tune in " out of pure desperation . " " i would rather go and see knut .
that would be more informative , " tiedje told newspaper der tagesspiegel , referring to the berlin zoo polar bear who is something of a global star . steinmeier 's uphill fight but steinmeier , who is both foreign minister and vice-chancellor , will have his work cut to close a double-digit gap on the hugely popular chancellor angela merkel .
a recent poll puts steinmeier 's social democrats at 23 percent , far behind merkel 's conservatives on 36 percent . this is steinmeier 's first run at higher office and his poll numbers indicate that he has n't really connected with the public .
that may change tonight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are having trouble distinguishing between the policies of the two main parties " what we have seen so far is that steinmeier is uncomfortable in the role of candidate , " manfred guellner , the head of polling firm forsa said .
" it will be tough to score points against merkel , who has gained a lot of experience with public events like this . " tough , but not impossible .
a large swing in voter opinion is not unheard of in german politics . back in 2002 , in a debate between gerhard schroeder and edmund stoiber , schroeder hammered stoiber on iraq and turned a likely defeat for the spd into a victory . merkel has the upper hand chancellor merkel , could benefit from tonight 's debate in a couple of ways .
by holding her own , or even impressing the voters , she could stop the erosion of support for her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in recent weeks . despite the conservatives ' lead over the spd , it is far from certain whether merkel will win enough votes to form a coalition with her desired partners , the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . nearly two-thirds of germans -lrb- 64 percent -rrb- believe merkel will " win " sunday 's debate , compared to only 15 percent who think steinmeier will triumph , according to a poll for ard public television. av / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel squares off with rival steinmeier in a tv debate sunday seen as a last chance for him to boost support for his social democratic party and close the large gap on the popular german leader . with just two weeks to go before the elections , frank-walter steinmeier needs to do something dramatic to boost his social democratic party 's -lrb- sdp -rrb- chances of getting more than the 23 percent of the vote that pollsters are predicting . steinmeier is the chancellor candidate for the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- for the national election on september 27 , as well as foreign minister .
his spd currently rules with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives in an uneasy " grand coalition . " with organizers hoping that at least 21 million people will tune in at 8:30 pm german time on sunday , the 90-minute tv debate could prove steinmeier 's last opportunity to turn around his party 's fortunes . " the tv debate is steinmeier 's big chance because he will reach millions of people , " political scientist karl-rudolf korte told bild am sonntag newspaper . merkel and steinmeier will be grilled by four prominent journalists on a wide range of topics , including the economic crisis and the war in afghanistan . steinmeier tries to seize initiative on german role in afghanistan just hours before the tv clash , steinmeier 's foreign ministry released a ten-point point to pull out german troops from afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's afghanistan withdrawal plan came hours before the tv debate german news magazine der spiegel reported that the plan called for the withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 german troops deployed in afghanistan by 2013 .
that could prove popular as most germans want their soldiers to come home . the german army 's operations in afghanistan have become a campaign issue ever since a controversial airstrike called by the german army last week .
the strike , which is being investigated by nato , may have killed many civilians . german operations in afghanistan have came under heavy international criticism after the incident . could tv clash energize dreary campaign ? the german election campaign so far has been largely uninspiring and non-combative .
both candidates are considered uncharismatic and they 've avoided attacking each other because they 've been coalition partners for the last four years . one of the moderators of the debate , rtl television news chief peter kloeppel , said he hoped the debate would finally inject some enthusiasm into what has been a largely dreary campaign . " we can try to pour some oil onto the fire but they will both have to play their part .

" we went to and have stayed in afghanistan to prevent terrorist attacks , including against ourselves , " steinmeier told super illu magazine .
" but we do n't want to stay forever .
the aim , over the course of the next parliamentary period , is to lay the foundations for a withdrawal . "
the foreign minister refused , however , to give a definite deadline for when the soldiers are to be out .
" it would n't be prudent to inform terrorist forces of the precise year in which the last foreign soldier will have left afghanistan , " he said .
the announcement is a move that could win steinmeier votes in the upcoming september 27 elections when he 'll be running as the social democratic candidate against incumbent german chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats .
the german foreign minister said the timeline of the withdrawal would depend on the capabilities of the local afghan forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.09.2009 still in slump , spain explores solutions to economic crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was brought to its knees when its property market collapsed with a public deficit nudging 10 percent of gdp , spain 's government is testing the waters on a series of recovery measures - from improved social protection to green stimulus . last week saw workers across spain protest at layoffs from the factories of bathroom manufacturer roca .
' what next ? ' read the banners of the angry demonstrators .
it 's a question most spaniards are asking as the country continues to wallow in recession .
for while france and germany have staged quick recoveries , spain is lagging behind .
spanish daily el pais reported this summer that the spanish gdp would shrink 4.2 percent this year , while the central european bank has predicted that it will be mid-2010 before the country starts to register growth .
spain buffeted by economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero says recovery will be slow prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government has been forced to admit that unemployment will likely rise to 20 percent this year of the working population and that the deficit is set to reach 10 percent of gdp .
the country has shed 1.3 million jobs in the last year , while employment figures for august show that last month , another 85,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed - over 18 percent of the active population .
that puts spain 's joblessness at more than double the eu average , a development blamed largely on the collapse of the spanish housing market and the end of the construction boom .
as a result , government spending has escalated and zapatero has warned that next year 's budget will " be the most austere spain has seen in the recent years . "
last week , he told parliament that recovery will be slow .
" signs that the deterioration is slowing does not mean that a recovery is here or will be fast .
there are signs that the worst of the recession has passed , but we are still suffering an intense crisis , " he said .
wefare and green energy so what is his government doing to help spain weather the crisis ?
with over a million unemployed people without any form of government support , one focus is welfare .
keen to keep unions on its side in the face of dwindling public support , the government has agreed to pay 420 euros a month to those who have exhausted their social security quotas , backdated to january 2009 .
around 600,000 people will benefit from the scheme , but it will cost the government an extra 100 million euros per month .
meanwhile , to reactivate the economy , the government has announced a new finance model that has echoes of a green new deal .
spain 's debt-fuelled property boom paid scant attention to either environmental concerns or sustainability .
now , the government has announced a 25- illion-euro stimulus package to boost technological innovation , investments in renewables and energy efficiency .
it makes sense for spain to play to its strengths .
after all , the country provided for 35 percent of its energy needs in january 2009 with renewables - making a saving of 90 million euros on gas imports , according to the wwf energy observatory .
moderate and temporary as for plugging the 50-billion-euro public deficit , the government has floated a couple of ideas in the last week ahead of 2010 budget announcements , due to be passed on 18 september .
one is to freeze civil servants ' salaries , introduce cuts across the ministries , and another , more controversially , to raise taxes .
zapatero announced the move , without enthusiasm , last week : " we are going to look at capital income , not at wages , to ask for a small - and it 's going to be small - increase in the contribution to the public purse .
it 's going to be moderate and as far as we can manage it , temporary , " he said .
no more false hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood in spain is subdued whatever form they take , tax hikes are likely to be passed through pacting with the left .
the government 's socialist approach to the crisis has attracted scorn from the main government opposition , the conservative pp who have also accused them of erratic and improvised policy .
the government has also been accused of failing to admit to the extent of the damage .
until recently , ministers expressed overriding optimism - choosing to focus on improving consumer confidence , the madrid stockmarket 's positive performance and the fact that even though unemployment is increasing , the rate is slowing .
but even before zapatero finally spelt out the grim truth about spain 's prospects of recovery this week , a more realistic mood had been apparent in madrid .
in july , deputy prime minister and economics minister elena salgado conceded that the economic outlook was worse than had been acknowledged .
the new honesty might prove constructive .
shows of unity from government , unions and business leaders have kept demonstrations like that at the roca plant to a minimum so far .
but with fresh economic data emerging that shows spain is by no means out of the woods , the government can not afford to raise false hopes .

" but we do n't want to stay forever .
the aim , over the course of the next parliamentary period , is to lay the foundations for a withdrawal . "
the foreign minister refused , however , to give a definite deadline for when the soldiers are to be out .
" it would n't be prudent to inform terrorist forces of the precise year in which the last foreign soldier will have left afghanistan , " he said .
the announcement is a move that could win steinmeier votes in the upcoming september 27 elections when he 'll be running as the social democratic candidate against incumbent german chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats .
the german foreign minister said the timeline of the withdrawal would depend on the capabilities of the local afghan forces .
talks are needed " to determine how long we and other international soldiers will have to stay and how many more afghan soldiers and policemen have to be trained to take full charge of security . "

" all of the international and national forces would have acted likewise .
if these fuel trucks had remained in the hands of enemies , they would have used them for terrorist purposes .

" he said the decision was " made with the intention of preventing significant danger , " to german , allied and afghan security forces . many german officials - including defense minister franz josef jung and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , both christian democrats - have already supported the decision to order the airstrike just over a week ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command there are vastly conflicting reports on the extent of casualties caused by the attack , but afghan authorities are investigating the incident more closely , along with nato .
german media reports suggest that at least some civilians were killed in the attack . with just weeks to go before the german general election , the unpopular afghan conflict has been catapulted into the midst of campaign season . " impressed " by colonel 's command schneiderhahn also said he visited colonel klein in afghanistan this spring , and had an in-depth discussion with the commander about the difficulties operating in afghanistan . " the professionalism with which our soldiers are acting , under constant threat and in an unsure situation , impressed me , " schneiderhahn said . however , the strike has come under criticism from some of germany 's nato allies , and colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command by ordering the airstrike . klein himself has welcomed the investigation into the attack in an interview with mass-circulation daily bild , describing such investigations into lethal military strikes as " necessary and correct . " " every isaf soldier or civilian killed in afghanistan is one too many , " klein said . msh / dpa / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but elsewhere criticism of the deal is growing amid reports of unfair competition and greater job losses than expected . with federal elections just two weeks away , top-ranking german politicians are celebrating general motors ' decision to sell ailing carmaker opel to canadian-austrian car parts maker magna .
the deal is seen in germany as a coup for chancellor angela merkel whose government had pressed hard for gm to choose a consortium of magna and sberbank of russia , offering 4.5 billion euros in german taxpayers ' money .
but the euphoria may be short-lived if a report in news magazine der spiegel is confirmed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to germany , opel employs thousands in other european nations the magazine said on saturday that magna plans to lay off more employees in germany than previously thought .
on top of 3,000 jobs in the production lines , another 1,100 are to be scrapped in the administration , it said .
the magna deal was favored in germany as it promised to preserve more jobs than rival bidder rhj international .
around half of gm 's 50,000 strong european work force is based in germany and opel 's new owners have pledged to keep open its four main plants in the country .
but the carmaker also employs thousands in spain , britain , belgium , italy , austria and france .
and fears are now growing that the new owners , magna and sberbank of russia , might axe jobs in other european sites in a bid to minimize losses in germany .
gm vice-president john smith said in berlin this week that opel 's new owners were " contemplating " winding down a plant in antwerp , belgium , and shifting some production from spain to germany .
state negotiator slams opel deal making matters more complicated for chancellor angela merkel 's government , the representative of the german federal states at the opel negotiations , dirk pfeil , also described the opel sale to magna as a " serious mistake . "
in an interview with radio station deutschlandfunk on saturday , pfeil said had he would not have taken part in the discussions had he “ known that it was going to be a purely political decision , and that business management considerations would be left in the shadows . ”
“ it is unique in my professional life that the party which has been acting as guarantor also decides on the buyer .
that is a bit odd and it does not fit into the system , " pfeil said .
eu warns of action against protectionism general motors announced this week it will sell 55 percent of its european subsidiary opel to magna and its russian partner bank sberbank and carmaker gaz .
gm will only retain a minority stake of 35 percent , while ten percent is to be held by opel employees .
the opel sale to magna has also attracted the interest of the european commission .
on saturday , european union competition commissioner neelie kroes warned she will take action if there is any protectionism in the sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes has warned of tough action if any protectionism is detected in the opel deal the belgian government says it wants the eu commission to investigate the opel deal amid concern that germany allegedly sought to protect its own plants at the cost of others .
kroes was quoted as saying saturday that " if something happens against the rules , i will take action . "
kroes added that state support should not be tied to factory locations .
merkel denies deal was politically motivated chancellor merkel on saturday however dismissed fears that the eu commission could put the brakes on the deals or block berlin 's package of government aid for opel .
in the sueddeutsche newspaper , she pointed out that the general framework of government aid from which the billions for opel are to come have already been approved by the commission .
there 's also criticism from within germany that berlin 's pressure on gm to favor magna was mostly politically motivated .
with general elections coming up on sept .
27 , the two parties in the current grand coalition needed a quick solution to the opel problem and a solution with as little job cuts within germany as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism has put chancellor merkel on the defensive analysts warn , however , that the true cost of the deal and more details about layoffs will be known only after the general election .
chancellor merkel on saturday dismissed that the opel rescue was politically motivated .
" we are not rescuing corporations , but are maintaining a chance for them in the financial crisis , " merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" but of course the company needs a solid concept for the future .
any company then has to prove itself on the market , there 's no way that the government can take off that pressure . " ai / dpa / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.09.2009 still in slump , spain explores solutions to economic crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain was brought to its knees when its property market collapsed with a public deficit nudging 10 percent of gdp , spain 's government is testing the waters on a series of recovery measures - from improved social protection to green stimulus . last week saw workers across spain protest at layoffs from the factories of bathroom manufacturer roca .
' what next ? ' read the banners of the angry demonstrators .
it 's a question most spaniards are asking as the country continues to wallow in recession .
for while france and germany have staged quick recoveries , spain is lagging behind .
spanish daily el pais reported this summer that the spanish gdp would shrink 4.2 percent this year , while the central european bank has predicted that it will be mid-2010 before the country starts to register growth .
spain buffeted by economic downturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero says recovery will be slow prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's government has been forced to admit that unemployment will likely rise to 20 percent this year of the working population and that the deficit is set to reach 10 percent of gdp .
the country has shed 1.3 million jobs in the last year , while employment figures for august show that last month , another 85,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed - over 18 percent of the active population .
that puts spain 's joblessness at more than double the eu average , a development blamed largely on the collapse of the spanish housing market and the end of the construction boom .
as a result , government spending has escalated and zapatero has warned that next year 's budget will " be the most austere spain has seen in the recent years . "
last week , he told parliament that recovery will be slow .
" signs that the deterioration is slowing does not mean that a recovery is here or will be fast .
there are signs that the worst of the recession has passed , but we are still suffering an intense crisis , " he said .
wefare and green energy so what is his government doing to help spain weather the crisis ?
with over a million unemployed people without any form of government support , one focus is welfare .
keen to keep unions on its side in the face of dwindling public support , the government has agreed to pay 420 euros a month to those who have exhausted their social security quotas , backdated to january 2009 .
around 600,000 people will benefit from the scheme , but it will cost the government an extra 100 million euros per month .
meanwhile , to reactivate the economy , the government has announced a new finance model that has echoes of a green new deal .
spain 's debt-fuelled property boom paid scant attention to either environmental concerns or sustainability .
now , the government has announced a 25- illion-euro stimulus package to boost technological innovation , investments in renewables and energy efficiency .
it makes sense for spain to play to its strengths .
after all , the country provided for 35 percent of its energy needs in january 2009 with renewables - making a saving of 90 million euros on gas imports , according to the wwf energy observatory .
moderate and temporary as for plugging the 50-billion-euro public deficit , the government has floated a couple of ideas in the last week ahead of 2010 budget announcements , due to be passed on 18 september .
one is to freeze civil servants ' salaries , introduce cuts across the ministries , and another , more controversially , to raise taxes .
zapatero announced the move , without enthusiasm , last week : " we are going to look at capital income , not at wages , to ask for a small - and it 's going to be small - increase in the contribution to the public purse .
it 's going to be moderate and as far as we can manage it , temporary , " he said .
no more false hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood in spain is subdued whatever form they take , tax hikes are likely to be passed through pacting with the left .
the government 's socialist approach to the crisis has attracted scorn from the main government opposition , the conservative pp who have also accused them of erratic and improvised policy .
the government has also been accused of failing to admit to the extent of the damage .
until recently , ministers expressed overriding optimism - choosing to focus on improving consumer confidence , the madrid stockmarket 's positive performance and the fact that even though unemployment is increasing , the rate is slowing .
but even before zapatero finally spelt out the grim truth about spain 's prospects of recovery this week , a more realistic mood had been apparent in madrid .
in july , deputy prime minister and economics minister elena salgado conceded that the economic outlook was worse than had been acknowledged .
the new honesty might prove constructive .
shows of unity from government , unions and business leaders have kept demonstrations like that at the roca plant to a minimum so far .
but with fresh economic data emerging that shows spain is by no means out of the woods , the government can not afford to raise false hopes .

the foreign minister refused , however , to give a definite deadline for when the soldiers are to be out .
" it would n't be prudent to inform terrorist forces of the precise year in which the last foreign soldier will have left afghanistan , " he said .
the announcement is a move that could win steinmeier votes in the upcoming september 27 elections when he 'll be running as the social democratic candidate against incumbent german chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats .
the german foreign minister said the timeline of the withdrawal would depend on the capabilities of the local afghan forces .
talks are needed " to determine how long we and other international soldiers will have to stay and how many more afghan soldiers and policemen have to be trained to take full charge of security . "
afghanistan is back on the election agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel is also pushing for an early exit german chancellor angela merkel touched upon an early german withdrawal from afghanistan herself on saturday .
" in association with our partners , we want to hammer out a strategy allowing for the transfer of responsibility to afghanistan over five years , " merkel said in an interview published in saturday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
on sunday night , merkel and steinmeier are to face each other in a televised debate which may help to determine the outcome of the september 27 election .
polls show that around 60 percent of voters want an end to germany 's participation in the nato mission .
all of germany 's major parties , other than the far-left left party , have so far backed the deployment of german troops in northern afghanistan .
karzai commission confirms 30 civilian deaths a controversial airstrike called by german troops in afghanistan earlier this month that killed scores of people has brought the issue back into the election campaign .
on sunday , a commission set up by afghan president hamid karzai said that a total of 30 civilians and 69 taliban were killed in the airstrike .
but mohamadulla batai of the commission added that the responsibility for the tragedy remained with the taliban and defended the german officer who ordered the airstrike . " not only the german troops would have ordered the airstrikes , " batai said .
" all of the international and national forces would have acted likewise .
if these fuel trucks had remained in the hands of enemies , they would have used them for terrorist purposes . " germany , britain and france last week called for an international conference on afghanistan to be held by the end of the year to set new goals for the nato mission in the country. ai / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said the decision was " made with the intention of preventing significant danger , " to german , allied and afghan security forces . many german officials - including defense minister franz josef jung and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , both christian democrats - have already supported the decision to order the airstrike just over a week ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command there are vastly conflicting reports on the extent of casualties caused by the attack , but afghan authorities are investigating the incident more closely , along with nato .
german media reports suggest that at least some civilians were killed in the attack . with just weeks to go before the german general election , the unpopular afghan conflict has been catapulted into the midst of campaign season . " impressed " by colonel 's command schneiderhahn also said he visited colonel klein in afghanistan this spring , and had an in-depth discussion with the commander about the difficulties operating in afghanistan . " the professionalism with which our soldiers are acting , under constant threat and in an unsure situation , impressed me , " schneiderhahn said . however , the strike has come under criticism from some of germany 's nato allies , and colonel klein has been accused of overstepping his command by ordering the airstrike . klein himself has welcomed the investigation into the attack in an interview with mass-circulation daily bild , describing such investigations into lethal military strikes as " necessary and correct . " " every isaf soldier or civilian killed in afghanistan is one too many , " klein said . msh / dpa / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last week cadbury rejected a £ 10.2bn approach from kraft foods , saying the approach " fundamentally undervalued " the dairy milk maker .
now cadbury chairman roger carr has sent an open letter to kraft chief executive irene rosenfeld .
he said the kraft proposal was " of uncertain value " for his shareholders .
the letter also says that under kraft 's offer , " cadbury would be absorbed into kraft 's low growth , conglomerate business model , an unappealing prospect " .
share movement mr carr said that it was in cadbury 's best interests to remain as a stand-alone confectioner .
kraft 's bid is worth 300p in cash and 0.2589 new kraft shares for each cadbury share , and originally valued cadbury at 745p a share or £ 10.2bn -lrb- $ 17bn -rrb- .
however , this had dropped to around 707p on friday due to the weakness in kraft shares and the dollar .
cadbury 's shares closed on friday at 775-1/2p .
kraft shares have fallen by about 7 % since it made its proposal .
as well as dairy milk , cadbury also owns the green & black 's chocolate brand and halls lozenges , trident and dentyne gum brands , and liquorice allsorts maker bassett 's .
it spun off its drinks division as a separate business last year .
kraft 's brands include kenco and maxwell house coffee , oreo biscuits , jacobs , terry 's chocolate orange and toblerone as well as cheese products such as philadelphia and dairylea .
a kraft spokesman said the company had no comment to make on mr carr 's letter .
