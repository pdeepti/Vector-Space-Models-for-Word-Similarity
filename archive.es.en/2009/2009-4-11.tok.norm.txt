frankfurt found out early . bayern munich returned to their winning ways on saturday , april 11 , as they beat eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
franck ribery set the tone , scoring after just three minutes and laying the groundwork for a long day for frankfurt . luca toni and lucio added first-half goals before germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger scored the final bayern goal in a victory that took them to second place in the table behind vfl wolfsburg . bayern 's victory will ease some of the pressure of beleaguered coach juergen klinsmann , whom some of the fans were even calling on to be sacked before the game .
all of that was forgotten though after just 16 minutes as ribery and toni had given the home side a two-goal lead . nine times in a row wolfsburg , who won 2-1 at moenchengladbach , are three points ahead of bayern on 54 points .
hamburg are also on 51 points and could move to second in the standings if they win at stuttgart on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg edin dzeko was a head better than gladbach in moenchengladbach , the struggling home side were unlucky not to come away with at least a point against the high-flying team from northern germany . close to 50,000 spectators saw bosnia striker edin dzeko open the scoring for the visitors midway through the first half .
dzeko 's 16th goal of the season gave the table-toppers some confidence against a more than equal gladbach squad .
when dante equalized for the home side in the 79th minute , wolfsburg did n't despair . they looked for a winner , which sascha riether scored five minutes from time , as the wolves notched their ninth victory in a row in the middle of a second-leg run that has catapulted them from ninth place to the top of the table . hertha 's voronin sees red hertha berlin lost 2-0 at hanover 96 and stayed on 49 points in fourth place .
berlin striker andrey voronin was responsible for hertha 's flight to the top last month but the ukrainian was sent off late in the match and will miss at least berlin 's next home game against werder bremen next week , reducing berlin 's chances to mix it up for the title . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's stanislav sestak , right , made life miserable for slumping hoffenheim former germany striker mike hanke and arnold bruggink scored the goals for hanover .
the side from the capital , who were leading the bundesliga standings a few weeks ago , have now lost three games in a row . schalke 04 moved closer to an uefa cup place with a 2-0 victory at home against karlsruhe .
kevin kuranyi gave schalke the lead in the 24th minute before jefferson farfan added a second - ten minutes from the end .
karlsruhe have now been scoreless for eight straight games .
schalke rivals borussia dortmund kept pace for an uefa cup spot with a 3-1 comeback victory over cologne . in a relegation battle , energie cottbus had bulgarians dimitar rangelov and stanislav angelov to thank for a 2-1 victory at home against fellow-strugglers arminia bielefeld .
although cottbus still occupy a relegation place , they are just one point behind bielefeld , who are 15th in the table . the final game saw autumn champions hoffenheim continue their downward slide .

" with the threats becoming more and more specific , the pirates refusing the offers made to them and the tanit heading towards the coast , an operation to free the hostages was decided upon , " a french presidential spokesman said .
" during the operation , a hostage was unfortunately killed , " he said .
" the four others - including the child - are safe and sound . "
the french commandos also killed two of the pirates and captured a further three .
prior to storming the yacht , french authorities had offered a ransom , and had offered to exchange a french military officer as a substitute hostage , to replace the woman and child on board the tanit .
" all these things were permanently and constantly refused , " french defense minister herve morin said .
morin said that the hostage who died was caught in an exchange of fire between the pirates and french forces .
he added that an investigation into the death has been launched .

it is thought they intend to use the ship as a shield . a pirate source told reuters that the pirates are counting on the fact that the americans will not destroy the german ship in any attempt to rescue captain richard phillips .
four heavily armed pirates holding the us navy captain hostage in a lifeboat far off the somali coast in the indian ocean since wednesday have been communicating with other pirate gangs who are now sailing a hijacked german ship to the site to avoid being attacked should us warships launch a rescue attempt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cargo ship " hansa stavanger " with 24 crew on board was hijacked a week ago it 's unclear which german ship the pirates are sailing towards the lifeboat .
the 20,000 tonne container carrier hansa stavanger with 24 crew on board , including five german nationals , was captured on april 4 .
pirates want 2.5 million euros for us captain the us is sending extra ships to waters off the somali coast to increase pressure on the somali pirates to release phillips .
the uss halyburton , a frigate carrying helicopters and guided missiles , arrived late on friday to join the uss bainbridge destroyer .
another frigate is due to arrive shortly .
captain phillips was captured after a failed attempt to hijack the 17,000-tonne maersk alabama 500 kilometres -lrb- 310 miles -rrb- off the somali coast in the indian ocean on wednesday .
the pirates are reportedly seeking a 1.5 million euro -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- ransom for his release .
phillips made a desperate attempt to escape overnight by jumping into the ocean , but he was recaptured after pirates fired gunshots .
he is the first american to be taken hostage by somali pirates .
" we are not afraid , " say pirates two boats full of heavily-armed fellow pirates have taken up position near lifeboat but are too nervous to come near due to the presence of foreign naval ships including us warships .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german war ship foiled a pirate attack on a german cargo ship on march 3 in the gulf of aden " we are not afraid of the americans , " one of the pirates told reuters by satellite phone on behalf of the pirates holding phillips , far off the somali coast in the indian ocean .
" we will defend ourselves if attacked . "
somali pirates who have been terrorising ships in the gulf of aden and indian ocean for years are currently holding around 270 hostages on around 13 ships .
pirate gangs in 2008 seized dozens of vessels and collected tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
international efforts to stop piracy around 15 warships from the european union , russia , the united states , india and china are patrolling an area of about 2.85 million square kilometres .
the pirates however are shifting their target areas further into the indian ocean to avoid the international patrols .
the pirates can freely return to somalia since there has been no functioning government in the lawless country since 1991 .
pirates late on friday released a norwegian-owned 23,000 mt bow asir tanker after receiving a ransom payment believed to be over 1.8 million euros -lrb- us $ 2.4 million . -rrb-

the survey also highlighted the stark differences that still remain between the west and east of the country . thirty-three percent of respondents in western germany and only 19 percent in eastern german answered that they planned to attend church this easter .
that correlates to official statistics that show just over 70 percent of germans in the west of the country consider themselves christians , while in the formerly communist east , the figure stands at just 26 percent .
meanwhile , more german women are interested in showing their faith this easter , with 36 percent indicating they would go to church , while only 25 percent of men plan to make the effort .
in germany , people have the choice whether to declare themselves as christians .
if they do , they are required to then pay a church tax , which is deducted directly from their monthly paychecks . cg / hf , dpa / ap / bild am sonntag send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this means that items such as chocolate no longer have to be sold in packages weighing either 100 grams or 85 grams .
other items that will now enjoy free reign on their size are beer , milk , water and fruit juice .
the volume of wine and spirits , however , will remain under strict regulation .

" for example , a bar of chocolate can now be 20 or 30 percent bigger , " she told the german news agency dpa .
a " simple scam " there is much opposition to the new regulations , with consumer-protection groups fearing manufacturers will use deceptive packaging - with smaller volumes , but equal prices .

he believes such scams would operate under the simple principle of " less inside but for the same price " .
armin valet from the hamburg consumer group , verbraucherzentrale hamburg agrees .
" consumers wo n't notice it , " he said .
valet claims such practices already occur for items that have n't had such strict regulations , such as cleaning products and cosmetics .
in recent years , the consumer group has exposed many hidden price increases for such items of more than 20 percent .
valet says it often happens when manufacturers offer what consumers see as attractive prices - such as 1.99 or 19.99 euros . cg / hf , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 11.04.2009 german food manufacturers now allowed to " supersize " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim the regulations give manufacturers more room for innovation , and more freedom for consumers it 's the revolution of the german supermarket shelves ; after years of strict regulations on packaging sizes , starting this saturday , most food items may be sold in any size or volume . the changes come after germany was forced to harmonize its packaging regulations with those set out by the european union .
this means that items such as chocolate no longer have to be sold in packages weighing either 100 grams or 85 grams .
other items that will now enjoy free reign on their size are beer , milk , water and fruit juice .
the volume of wine and spirits , however , will remain under strict regulation .
no more gorging for lonesome singles retail groups like germany 's retail federation , hde , claim the changes will be consumer friendly , and will better cater to a wider market , with singles and the elderly able to buy items in smaller packaging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may no longer be so easy to compare prices when shopping for things like milk ulrike hoerchens of hde does n't expect many changes to be introduced for many of the products , including milk .
" consumers are familiar with the package size for milk and there 's little reason to them change that , " she said .
instead , hoerchens said reasons to alter packaging sizes will be driven by marketing .
" for example , a bar of chocolate can now be 20 or 30 percent bigger , " she told the german news agency dpa .
a " simple scam " there is much opposition to the new regulations , with consumer-protection groups fearing manufacturers will use deceptive packaging - with smaller volumes , but equal prices .
" it 's going to open the floodgates to scam packaging , " gerd billen of the federation of german consumer organizations said .
he believes such scams would operate under the simple principle of " less inside but for the same price " .
armin valet from the hamburg consumer group , verbraucherzentrale hamburg agrees .
" consumers wo n't notice it , " he said .
valet claims such practices already occur for items that have n't had such strict regulations , such as cleaning products and cosmetics .
in recent years , the consumer group has exposed many hidden price increases for such items of more than 20 percent .

the spanish interior ministry in madrid has called it a very important arrest . ekaitz sirvent auzmendi , who is reportedly the no. 2 member of the group 's logistical operations , was carrying a handgun when he was apprehended by police .
french police say auzmendi was seized after he got off a high-speed train from bordeaux .
he 'd been under police surveillance during the train journey .
spain 's interior ministry said in a statement that a laptop and a large quantity of computer-equipment including usb sticks and hard discs were seized during the arrest .
he was also carrying false french and spanish identity papers at the time .

the spanish interior ministry in madrid has called it a very important arrest . ekaitz sirvent auzmendi , who is reportedly the no. 2 member of the group 's logistical operations , was carrying a handgun when he was apprehended by police .
french police say auzmendi was seized after he got off a high-speed train from bordeaux .

spain 's interior ministry said in a statement that a laptop and a large quantity of computer-equipment including usb sticks and hard discs were seized during the arrest .
he was also carrying false french and spanish identity papers at the time .

spanish investigators suspect forging documents was part of his duties for the banned separatist group .
eta is listed as a terrorist organization by both the european union and the united states .

frankfurt found out early . bayern munich returned to their winning ways on saturday , april 11 , as they beat eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
franck ribery set the tone , scoring after just three minutes and laying the groundwork for a long day for frankfurt . luca toni and lucio added first-half goals before germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger scored the final bayern goal in a victory that took them to second place in the table behind vfl wolfsburg . bayern 's victory will ease some of the pressure of beleaguered coach juergen klinsmann , whom some of the fans were even calling on to be sacked before the game .
all of that was forgotten though after just 16 minutes as ribery and toni had given the home side a two-goal lead . nine times in a row wolfsburg , who won 2-1 at moenchengladbach , are three points ahead of bayern on 54 points .
hamburg are also on 51 points and could move to second in the standings if they win at stuttgart on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg edin dzeko was a head better than gladbach in moenchengladbach , the struggling home side were unlucky not to come away with at least a point against the high-flying team from northern germany . close to 50,000 spectators saw bosnia striker edin dzeko open the scoring for the visitors midway through the first half .
dzeko 's 16th goal of the season gave the table-toppers some confidence against a more than equal gladbach squad .
when dante equalized for the home side in the 79th minute , wolfsburg did n't despair . they looked for a winner , which sascha riether scored five minutes from time , as the wolves notched their ninth victory in a row in the middle of a second-leg run that has catapulted them from ninth place to the top of the table . hertha 's voronin sees red hertha berlin lost 2-0 at hanover 96 and stayed on 49 points in fourth place .
berlin striker andrey voronin was responsible for hertha 's flight to the top last month but the ukrainian was sent off late in the match and will miss at least berlin 's next home game against werder bremen next week , reducing berlin 's chances to mix it up for the title . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's stanislav sestak , right , made life miserable for slumping hoffenheim former germany striker mike hanke and arnold bruggink scored the goals for hanover .
the side from the capital , who were leading the bundesliga standings a few weeks ago , have now lost three games in a row . schalke 04 moved closer to an uefa cup place with a 2-0 victory at home against karlsruhe .
kevin kuranyi gave schalke the lead in the 24th minute before jefferson farfan added a second - ten minutes from the end .
karlsruhe have now been scoreless for eight straight games .
schalke rivals borussia dortmund kept pace for an uefa cup spot with a 3-1 comeback victory over cologne . in a relegation battle , energie cottbus had bulgarians dimitar rangelov and stanislav angelov to thank for a 2-1 victory at home against fellow-strugglers arminia bielefeld .
although cottbus still occupy a relegation place , they are just one point behind bielefeld , who are 15th in the table . the final game saw autumn champions hoffenheim continue their downward slide .

the contents of their art business were sold by nazis and ultimately ended up in the collection of newspaper mogul william randolph hearst , who displayed them in his castle in california .
the handing-over ceremony ended what was a two-year investigation by california state parks officials into the artworks ' origins .
state officials said they believed hearst was unaware of the paintings ' origins because they were purchased through a third party gallery .

" during the operation , a hostage was unfortunately killed , " he said .
" the four others - including the child - are safe and sound . "
the french commandos also killed two of the pirates and captured a further three .

" all these things were permanently and constantly refused , " french defense minister herve morin said .
morin said that the hostage who died was caught in an exchange of fire between the pirates and french forces .
he added that an investigation into the death has been launched .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 11.04.2009 bayern bounce back from barca drubbing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern could again hold their heads up after a disappointing week while a late goal at moenchengladbach kept wolfsburg atop the bundesliga , most german soccer fans were curious how bayern would recover from their disastrous 4-0 midweek defeat by barcelona .
frankfurt found out early . bayern munich returned to their winning ways on saturday , april 11 , as they beat eintracht frankfurt 4-0 .
franck ribery set the tone , scoring after just three minutes and laying the groundwork for a long day for frankfurt . luca toni and lucio added first-half goals before germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger scored the final bayern goal in a victory that took them to second place in the table behind vfl wolfsburg . bayern 's victory will ease some of the pressure of beleaguered coach juergen klinsmann , whom some of the fans were even calling on to be sacked before the game .
all of that was forgotten though after just 16 minutes as ribery and toni had given the home side a two-goal lead . nine times in a row wolfsburg , who won 2-1 at moenchengladbach , are three points ahead of bayern on 54 points .
hamburg are also on 51 points and could move to second in the standings if they win at stuttgart on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg edin dzeko was a head better than gladbach in moenchengladbach , the struggling home side were unlucky not to come away with at least a point against the high-flying team from northern germany . close to 50,000 spectators saw bosnia striker edin dzeko open the scoring for the visitors midway through the first half .
dzeko 's 16th goal of the season gave the table-toppers some confidence against a more than equal gladbach squad .
when dante equalized for the home side in the 79th minute , wolfsburg did n't despair . they looked for a winner , which sascha riether scored five minutes from time , as the wolves notched their ninth victory in a row in the middle of a second-leg run that has catapulted them from ninth place to the top of the table . hertha 's voronin sees red hertha berlin lost 2-0 at hanover 96 and stayed on 49 points in fourth place .
berlin striker andrey voronin was responsible for hertha 's flight to the top last month but the ukrainian was sent off late in the match and will miss at least berlin 's next home game against werder bremen next week , reducing berlin 's chances to mix it up for the title . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's stanislav sestak , right , made life miserable for slumping hoffenheim former germany striker mike hanke and arnold bruggink scored the goals for hanover .
the side from the capital , who were leading the bundesliga standings a few weeks ago , have now lost three games in a row . schalke 04 moved closer to an uefa cup place with a 2-0 victory at home against karlsruhe .
kevin kuranyi gave schalke the lead in the 24th minute before jefferson farfan added a second - ten minutes from the end .
karlsruhe have now been scoreless for eight straight games .

it is thought they intend to use the ship as a shield . a pirate source told reuters that the pirates are counting on the fact that the americans will not destroy the german ship in any attempt to rescue captain richard phillips .
four heavily armed pirates holding the us navy captain hostage in a lifeboat far off the somali coast in the indian ocean since wednesday have been communicating with other pirate gangs who are now sailing a hijacked german ship to the site to avoid being attacked should us warships launch a rescue attempt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cargo ship " hansa stavanger " with 24 crew on board was hijacked a week ago it 's unclear which german ship the pirates are sailing towards the lifeboat .
the 20,000 tonne container carrier hansa stavanger with 24 crew on board , including five german nationals , was captured on april 4 .
pirates want 2.5 million euros for us captain the us is sending extra ships to waters off the somali coast to increase pressure on the somali pirates to release phillips .
the uss halyburton , a frigate carrying helicopters and guided missiles , arrived late on friday to join the uss bainbridge destroyer .
another frigate is due to arrive shortly .
captain phillips was captured after a failed attempt to hijack the 17,000-tonne maersk alabama 500 kilometres -lrb- 310 miles -rrb- off the somali coast in the indian ocean on wednesday .
the pirates are reportedly seeking a 1.5 million euro -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- ransom for his release .
phillips made a desperate attempt to escape overnight by jumping into the ocean , but he was recaptured after pirates fired gunshots .
he is the first american to be taken hostage by somali pirates .
" we are not afraid , " say pirates two boats full of heavily-armed fellow pirates have taken up position near lifeboat but are too nervous to come near due to the presence of foreign naval ships including us warships .

" we will defend ourselves if attacked . "
somali pirates who have been terrorising ships in the gulf of aden and indian ocean for years are currently holding around 270 hostages on around 13 ships .
pirate gangs in 2008 seized dozens of vessels and collected tens of millions of dollars in ransom .
international efforts to stop piracy around 15 warships from the european union , russia , the united states , india and china are patrolling an area of about 2.85 million square kilometres .
the pirates however are shifting their target areas further into the indian ocean to avoid the international patrols .
the pirates can freely return to somalia since there has been no functioning government in the lawless country since 1991 .
pirates late on friday released a norwegian-owned 23,000 mt bow asir tanker after receiving a ransom payment believed to be over 1.8 million euros -lrb- us $ 2.4 million . -rrb-

" the government has a duty to take care of the leaders who will depart from thailand , " prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said in an address on thai television .
" in this extremely serious situation , the government has decided to impose a state of emergency in pattaya and chonburi to deal with the situation . "
foreign leaders were being evacuated by helicopter .
ahead of the summit , the thai government had made assurances that it would take whatever measures necessary to prevent such a situation .
officials have now acknowledged that security forces had failed to do just that .
" red shirts " protestors the protesters , who support former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , held an impromptu press conference to air their grievances .

“ we want to tell him that if he holds an election and wins fairly then we will accept him .
now he is illegitimate and we can not stand for this . ”
the “ red shirts ” protesters said they will remain inside the hotel until abhisit resigns and claim they stormed the building after three fellow supporters were wounded in earlier clashes with pro-government demonstrators .

his two-year battle with the disease ended on tuesday when he passed away peacefully , his daughter said .
arneson created the game famous for its oddly shaped dice in 1974 along with the late gary gygax .
" the biggest thing about my dad 's world is he wanted people to have fun in life , " said his daughter malia .
arneson and gygax developed d & d using medieval characters and mythical creatures and it was a worldwide hit , particularly among teenage boys .
it eventually was turned into video games , books and films .
pioneer " i think we get distracted by the everyday things you have to do in life and we forget to enjoy life and have fun , " malia weinhagen told the associated press .
" but my dad never did .
he just wanted people to have fun . "
d & d , described by ap as " the quintessential geek pastime " , spawned copycat games and later inspired a whole genre of computer games that is still growing in popularity .
" -lsb- arneson -rsb- developed many of the fundamental ideas of role-playing : that each player controls just one hero , that heroes gain power through adventures and that personality is as important as combat prowess , " said a statement from wizards of the coast , which produces d & d. the company noted that blackmoor , a game arneson had been developing before d & d , was the " first-ever role-playing campaign and the prototype for all -lsb- role-playing game -rsb- campaigns since " .
arneson met gygax , who died in march of last year , at a games convention in 1969 .
he is survived by his daughter and two grandchildren .
your tributes : dave was a nice guy ; i grew up playing his games but only met him as an adult - i spoke to him regularly and met him a few times over the last few years and was always happy to hear from him - he had a great attitude and a wonderful sense of humor .
thanks for everything , dave , and of course , a belated thanks to gary gygax , whom i neither met nor spoke with , but who will remain a massive influence on my life .
jamie blackman , louisiana , usa never having played d & d , i got to know dave arneson through a side project related to the ' runelords ' movie that never happened .
we became friends - he sent me all the texts on his ' blackmoor ' series , i sent him the uk copy of the dungeons and dragons movie that had the little extra showing him in the tower at the end of the movie -lrb- they never released that extra in the states -rrb- .
i only spoke to him a couple of weeks back , and he had said he was unwell .
at least it is over .
i 'm gutted i 'll never be able to drive you to blackmoor in southern england now dave , but it 's been a pleasure to know you .
matt harrill , bristol , england i remember nights spent with friends among the candlelight , dices and sheets of paper with sparks in out eyes doing something magical together , transcending ourselves and our environment .
i also remember hours and hours spend playing computer d & d based rpgs ...
now , no matter how geeky it was , i think i learned a lot from those days .
how to be careful , how to take risks , how to think in critical situations ..
and the people i played with , i really explored them from very different perspectives .
it was a very valuable experience , no less significant in the process of growing up than reading , going to the theater plays and concerts .
the system he created and the worlds that came out of it are deep , interesting and serve as valuable tools for people to learn many different things about themselves , their lives and the reality .
it might seems strange how it teaches reality being completely unreal and based on imagination but it does .
thank you dave .
you were doing an amazing thing , far more than creating a new way of entertainment .
your legacy will be always living on .
rest in peace .
aleksey andreev , whitewater , wi rest easy , you will be missed ...
thank you both for a way for a socially inept doofus to align with " normals " .
you made it possible for me to not have to explain myself ... scott hanley , venice , ca regards to the chap who has given me a sad life for the past 40 years - a role player , remember this - whoever dies with the most characters wins. bobbus , normandy thanks for years of fun and adventure .
you brought the greatest worlds of all to us - the worlds of our own imaginations .
rest in peace .
nicholas lee , exeter , uk even though i have n't played for years i can still remember spending hour upon hour playing d & d with friends .
the times we have just fallen about laughing at some of the things that used to go on on some of our adventures still make me smile now .
thanks for the fun dave .
god bless john scattergood , birmingham uk chadwell heath is arguably one of the least interesting towns in the uk , with scant facilities for youth .
as a teenager with about 30p a week pocket money -lrb- enough for a series 1 airfix model kit , bought and assembled every saturday -rrb- , d & d was an excellent way to pass a friday and a saturday evening .
we moved on from d & d to traveller , chivalry and sorcery , dragonquest , merp and star empires .
no underage drinking , hanging out on street corners , experimenting with drugs , just tea , cakes and good company .
we did it from 1976 until some of us got married and moved away -lrb- mid to late ' 90s -rrb- .
some still do it today .
paul t horgan , bracknell , uk thank you .
nikhil kini , mumbai , india my first d & d game was in 1980 with my family and friends .
we are still playing now .
it 's a way of life , not just a game .
i am now 62 and a grandma on the outside , but a powerful priest who slaughtered iuz and many more demi-gods over the years in my life in d & d. thanks for all that .
i shall never forget you .
julie keymer , cambridge , uk i 'm sad to see one of the men who helped define my life pass .
i grew up a closet geek , and now i 'm an out and out geek .
d & d -lrb- and it 's myriad offshoots -rrb- have meant i 've had a close circle of friends that i still play games with sixteen years later .
an epic level man passed away - and he 'll be missed by a great more communities than maybe he 'll have ever known .
paul drew , oxford d & d was the epitome of interactive escapism ; long before the days of playstation and xbox . - d & d , described by ap as " the quintessential geek pastime " - yeah sure .
instead we have gangs of hoodies hanging around street corners with nothing better to do then harass people and trash cars .
abdul m. ismail , liverpool , uk thanks for endless hours of fantasy adventures .
playing since 1983 , and still have the original hardback books .
you spawned many a young man like me into a fantasy addict , its all i read , and all i attempt to write .
you 'll always be remembered and thanked .
simon , gorey , ireland another hero of the genre passes away .
condolences to his family and friends , and a huge thank you to a man who provided so much enjoyment to so many people .
even if we are geeks : -rrb- tony mcqueen , portsmouth uk would just like to say that both dave and gary will be fondly remembered by me , as the " quintessential geek " mentioned in the article was me , and many of my friends at school playing the first d & d , then ad & d and moving on through the computer game genre -lrb- who remembers " valhalla " ? -rrb- which has become such a huge phenomenon , and which was single-handedly spawned by these two .
rip .
carl hobbs , folkestone , uk thanks for creating such a wonderful game and pastime .
dnd was a major influence in my childhood , and its effect on pop culture have made it part of my life through influencing movies , and video games .
the world would have been poorer without your work .
thanks for the experiences and fun that still continues , and i hope to share them with my son when he is old enough .
rip you legends .
kurt dean , sydney i was young , i was happy .
i 'm still young , i 'm still happy !
thanks and " ' till our swords meet again " celebgil eltar telperion , rome , italy wow , yet another great loss in the role-playing games field .
gygax and arneson helped out a lot of us high school outcasts cope with the angst of the teenage years ; they will be missed .
randall c. , alexandria , u.s.a. i was never much for rpgs but always had respect for people who played them .
to see my friends get so involved and to see their imaginations running wild was wonderful .
i was almost jealous at times .
he was a pioneer that deserves head line coverage and his legacy will last forever in many peoples hearts .
respect .
j. w. jessy forsyth , istanbul , turkey for giving me the opportunity to dream of worlds beyond reality , to fight for my beliefs of right .
to open my mind to accept what can be possible , and to awaken a never-ending kaleidoscope of imagination , i thank you both .
benji ong , q.c. philippines by now he 's probably rolling in his grave .
stephen hennelly , berlin , germany i played dungeons and dragons as a teenager , and am one of the typical geeks who played it -lrb- i am a 39 year old software engineer -rrb- .
though the teachers of our high school actually banned it because they thought it " undermined our morals " we continued to meet and play in secret , with our painted lead figurines of thieves , paladins , assassins and various monsters .
we spent hours painting those figurines while listening to heavy metal .
i was just the other day considering taking it back up again and showed my girlfriend the wikipedia pages on the guys who invented d & d. rest in peace dave arneson and gary gygax .
lindsay kay , auckland , new zealand i was thirteen when i first played d & d. i 'm forty next month and like many who started then i 'm still playing now , thanks to dave and gary .
they began it all .
it all started with these two .
without them the world would have been a sadder place .
what else can i say except thanks .
rchard , valencia i must thank arneson and gygax for their creativity and imagination .
almost all of the fondest memories i have in my life are with my friends growing up , and almost every time we were together , nightly , religiously , we would be in my friend steve 's garage immersed in our make believe land within the realm of d & d. the game spawned my alter ego hexen soulblade , which followed me through most of middle school .
as humorous as it sounds , i will never forget the fun and togetherness i felt when we were were huddled at that table .
life and all of its stresses ceased to exist , and we were free in a far away land full of adventure and laughter and trials and triumph. only a game to some , but to me it was what kept us -lrb- myself and my family of friends -rrb- togeather , and happy .
thank you !
antonio periera -lrb- hexen soulblade -rrb- , seward , illinois , usa i guess you finally rolled a natural 1 .
rest in peace .

we will hold a memorial game .
sarah ross , aberystwyth wales gygax and arneson , your legacy lives on !

umer mumtaz , islamabad , pakistan thank you for great ideas that have made my life happier .

all my best to your family , wish them strengh to go through this .
nitzah , uk rest in peace .
ad & d was the first role-playing system for me that i got attached to in early years of high-school in ' 92 .
in croatia , we did n't even have the real books at that time so we used bad copies of the copies supplemented with hand-written notes ...
i spent many nights with my closest friends roleplaying instead of sleeping in those days .
but we were not in a small room but someplace else , wielding swords and magic ...
it brings back dear and unique memories that only fellow role-players can understand .
thank you guys and condolences to the family .
marko gacesa , zagreb , croatia rest easy , mate .
you will be remembered .
thanks for many years of fun -lrb- since 77 -rrb- .
guess you finally failed your save . happens to all of us in the end. mark fitzgibbon , abu dhabi , uae thank you for your dreams and ideas that spawned d & d. i have the original and all the later editions .
your game kept me thinking and imagining , and made me friends .
i kept out of trouble because i just wanted 1 more adventure .

save vs constitution , failed .
rest well and continue adventuring wherever you now may be .
keith tan , singapore rest in peace , you and gary gygax , and we never forget you .
nabil ben hariz ben hariz , thiais france due to arneson 's & gygax 's efforts i will forever cherish the hours & hours i spent huddled in my garage with 6 of my closest friends .
it was a wonderfully inventive way to spend a day with friends . even though one was a hair-brained barbarian that would never check for traps , and contributed in me losing my favorite sword . even now , though i have n't played in years , in the back of my closet , i still have my dice , manuals , dungeon maps , and character sheets ready if anyone happen to have a game going ? ?
anyone ? ?
you both shall be missed but never forgotten .
finneas macabre , usa , mississippi , biloxi as a long time and ardent fan of d & d / ad & d and now a veteran warcrafter in the 40 's bracket , this man and the late gary gygax have given me thousands of hours of fun , adventure , thrills in the comfort of my own imagination .
a great loss that will be felt by all that play the game past and present .
ian watson , dorset while many may disparage the validity or usefulness of role playing games , there is no way to overlook their gateway for loners into social groups .
awkward teens worldwide can find common ground in the escapism role playing provides .
i remember picking up the first edition of d & d when i was about ten and being awestruck by the world presented therein , as well as perplexed by the awkward d4 dice .
i 'm sure many have had similar experiences .
this shy and reserved individual has grown to be a productive and sociable member of the community , and i place a great deal of credit for that at the feet of these two men .
they spawned a universe of books , games , history , and friendships for me .
i wish more people had an understanding of the value and direction they 've provided across a wide stretch of all aspects of the entertainment industry .
d20s forever .
timothy roller , seattle , u.s.a. gary gygax and dave arneson did n't just invent a game , they invented a hobby that shaped my entire life .
my first memories of dungeons and dragons are of family games .
i was the dungeon master , father was a fighter , mother was an elf , and grandmother was a wizard .
i miss those cheerful days , and i 'll miss the men who made them possible .
chris nail , baton rouge , la , u.s.a. if i 'd had the chance in this life , i 'd have told dave arneson thanks for d & d and all the attendant good times i 've enjoyed with my friends as a result of playing the game .
my heartfelt condolences go out to the arneson family .
ewan cummins , usa rip .
i spent many hours with my friends enjoying rpg 's including mr. arneson 's games .
the quality of entertainment and thought he put into his games and game systems provided millions of people a popular and relaxing pastime .
that is his legacy .
he left the world much improved than he entered it .
in the end , that is all anyone can do. mike , buffalo , ny the true wizards have departed .
may your hit points always be copious .

his two-year battle with the disease ended on tuesday when he passed away peacefully , his daughter said .
arneson created the game famous for its oddly shaped dice in 1974 along with the late gary gygax .
" the biggest thing about my dad 's world is he wanted people to have fun in life , " said his daughter malia .
arneson and gygax developed d & d using medieval characters and mythical creatures and it was a worldwide hit , particularly among teenage boys .
it eventually was turned into video games , books and films .
pioneer " i think we get distracted by the everyday things you have to do in life and we forget to enjoy life and have fun , " malia weinhagen told the associated press .
" but my dad never did .
he just wanted people to have fun . "
d & d , described by ap as " the quintessential geek pastime " , spawned copycat games and later inspired a whole genre of computer games that is still growing in popularity .
" -lsb- arneson -rsb- developed many of the fundamental ideas of role-playing : that each player controls just one hero , that heroes gain power through adventures and that personality is as important as combat prowess , " said a statement from wizards of the coast , which produces d & d. the company noted that blackmoor , a game arneson had been developing before d & d , was the " first-ever role-playing campaign and the prototype for all -lsb- role-playing game -rsb- campaigns since " .
arneson met gygax , who died in march of last year , at a games convention in 1969 .
he is survived by his daughter and two grandchildren .
your tributes : dave was a nice guy ; i grew up playing his games but only met him as an adult - i spoke to him regularly and met him a few times over the last few years and was always happy to hear from him - he had a great attitude and a wonderful sense of humor .
thanks for everything , dave , and of course , a belated thanks to gary gygax , whom i neither met nor spoke with , but who will remain a massive influence on my life .
jamie blackman , louisiana , usa never having played d & d , i got to know dave arneson through a side project related to the ' runelords ' movie that never happened .
we became friends - he sent me all the texts on his ' blackmoor ' series , i sent him the uk copy of the dungeons and dragons movie that had the little extra showing him in the tower at the end of the movie -lrb- they never released that extra in the states -rrb- .
i only spoke to him a couple of weeks back , and he had said he was unwell .
at least it is over .
i 'm gutted i 'll never be able to drive you to blackmoor in southern england now dave , but it 's been a pleasure to know you .
matt harrill , bristol , england i remember nights spent with friends among the candlelight , dices and sheets of paper with sparks in out eyes doing something magical together , transcending ourselves and our environment .
i also remember hours and hours spend playing computer d & d based rpgs ...
now , no matter how geeky it was , i think i learned a lot from those days .
how to be careful , how to take risks , how to think in critical situations ..
and the people i played with , i really explored them from very different perspectives .
it was a very valuable experience , no less significant in the process of growing up than reading , going to the theater plays and concerts .
the system he created and the worlds that came out of it are deep , interesting and serve as valuable tools for people to learn many different things about themselves , their lives and the reality .
it might seems strange how it teaches reality being completely unreal and based on imagination but it does .
thank you dave .
you were doing an amazing thing , far more than creating a new way of entertainment .
your legacy will be always living on .
rest in peace .
aleksey andreev , whitewater , wi rest easy , you will be missed ...
thank you both for a way for a socially inept doofus to align with " normals " .
you made it possible for me to not have to explain myself ... scott hanley , venice , ca regards to the chap who has given me a sad life for the past 40 years - a role player , remember this - whoever dies with the most characters wins. bobbus , normandy thanks for years of fun and adventure .
you brought the greatest worlds of all to us - the worlds of our own imaginations .
rest in peace .
nicholas lee , exeter , uk even though i have n't played for years i can still remember spending hour upon hour playing d & d with friends .
the times we have just fallen about laughing at some of the things that used to go on on some of our adventures still make me smile now .
thanks for the fun dave .
god bless john scattergood , birmingham uk chadwell heath is arguably one of the least interesting towns in the uk , with scant facilities for youth .
as a teenager with about 30p a week pocket money -lrb- enough for a series 1 airfix model kit , bought and assembled every saturday -rrb- , d & d was an excellent way to pass a friday and a saturday evening .
we moved on from d & d to traveller , chivalry and sorcery , dragonquest , merp and star empires .
no underage drinking , hanging out on street corners , experimenting with drugs , just tea , cakes and good company .
we did it from 1976 until some of us got married and moved away -lrb- mid to late ' 90s -rrb- .
some still do it today .
paul t horgan , bracknell , uk thank you .
nikhil kini , mumbai , india my first d & d game was in 1980 with my family and friends .
we are still playing now .
it 's a way of life , not just a game .
i am now 62 and a grandma on the outside , but a powerful priest who slaughtered iuz and many more demi-gods over the years in my life in d & d. thanks for all that .
i shall never forget you .
julie keymer , cambridge , uk i 'm sad to see one of the men who helped define my life pass .
i grew up a closet geek , and now i 'm an out and out geek .
d & d -lrb- and it 's myriad offshoots -rrb- have meant i 've had a close circle of friends that i still play games with sixteen years later .
an epic level man passed away - and he 'll be missed by a great more communities than maybe he 'll have ever known .
paul drew , oxford d & d was the epitome of interactive escapism ; long before the days of playstation and xbox . - d & d , described by ap as " the quintessential geek pastime " - yeah sure .
instead we have gangs of hoodies hanging around street corners with nothing better to do then harass people and trash cars .
abdul m. ismail , liverpool , uk thanks for endless hours of fantasy adventures .
playing since 1983 , and still have the original hardback books .
you spawned many a young man like me into a fantasy addict , its all i read , and all i attempt to write .
you 'll always be remembered and thanked .
simon , gorey , ireland another hero of the genre passes away .
condolences to his family and friends , and a huge thank you to a man who provided so much enjoyment to so many people .
even if we are geeks : -rrb- tony mcqueen , portsmouth uk would just like to say that both dave and gary will be fondly remembered by me , as the " quintessential geek " mentioned in the article was me , and many of my friends at school playing the first d & d , then ad & d and moving on through the computer game genre -lrb- who remembers " valhalla " ? -rrb- which has become such a huge phenomenon , and which was single-handedly spawned by these two .
rip .
carl hobbs , folkestone , uk thanks for creating such a wonderful game and pastime .
dnd was a major influence in my childhood , and its effect on pop culture have made it part of my life through influencing movies , and video games .
the world would have been poorer without your work .
thanks for the experiences and fun that still continues , and i hope to share them with my son when he is old enough .
rip you legends .
kurt dean , sydney i was young , i was happy .
i 'm still young , i 'm still happy !
thanks and " ' till our swords meet again " celebgil eltar telperion , rome , italy wow , yet another great loss in the role-playing games field .
gygax and arneson helped out a lot of us high school outcasts cope with the angst of the teenage years ; they will be missed .
randall c. , alexandria , u.s.a. i was never much for rpgs but always had respect for people who played them .
to see my friends get so involved and to see their imaginations running wild was wonderful .
i was almost jealous at times .
he was a pioneer that deserves head line coverage and his legacy will last forever in many peoples hearts .
respect .
j. w. jessy forsyth , istanbul , turkey for giving me the opportunity to dream of worlds beyond reality , to fight for my beliefs of right .
to open my mind to accept what can be possible , and to awaken a never-ending kaleidoscope of imagination , i thank you both .
benji ong , q.c. philippines by now he 's probably rolling in his grave .
stephen hennelly , berlin , germany i played dungeons and dragons as a teenager , and am one of the typical geeks who played it -lrb- i am a 39 year old software engineer -rrb- .
though the teachers of our high school actually banned it because they thought it " undermined our morals " we continued to meet and play in secret , with our painted lead figurines of thieves , paladins , assassins and various monsters .
we spent hours painting those figurines while listening to heavy metal .
i was just the other day considering taking it back up again and showed my girlfriend the wikipedia pages on the guys who invented d & d. rest in peace dave arneson and gary gygax .
lindsay kay , auckland , new zealand i was thirteen when i first played d & d. i 'm forty next month and like many who started then i 'm still playing now , thanks to dave and gary .
they began it all .
it all started with these two .
without them the world would have been a sadder place .
what else can i say except thanks .
rchard , valencia i must thank arneson and gygax for their creativity and imagination .
almost all of the fondest memories i have in my life are with my friends growing up , and almost every time we were together , nightly , religiously , we would be in my friend steve 's garage immersed in our make believe land within the realm of d & d. the game spawned my alter ego hexen soulblade , which followed me through most of middle school .
as humorous as it sounds , i will never forget the fun and togetherness i felt when we were were huddled at that table .
life and all of its stresses ceased to exist , and we were free in a far away land full of adventure and laughter and trials and triumph. only a game to some , but to me it was what kept us -lrb- myself and my family of friends -rrb- togeather , and happy .
thank you !
antonio periera -lrb- hexen soulblade -rrb- , seward , illinois , usa i guess you finally rolled a natural 1 .
rest in peace .
thank you that in your life time you created a world of role play that has deviated and expanded so much and given me so much in my life .
we will hold a memorial game .
sarah ross , aberystwyth wales gygax and arneson , your legacy lives on !
next weekend , my 5 friends and i will be spending the entire night at a kitchen table with our character sheets , d20 's , and figurines .
i want your families to know that we six awkward teenagers still remember your brilliance .
thanks for the all-nighters .
adeline the pleasant , buffalo , ny thanks for bringing intelligent fun in my teenage years !
mattia leoni , clonakilty , ireland who says he is dead ?

' death is more universal than life ; everyone dies but not everyone lives ! '
umer mumtaz , islamabad , pakistan thank you for great ideas that have made my life happier .
in some of my best memories i am playing d & d with my friends , and it has influenced all my likes and dislikes since i got to know it .
hope you have fun in a very good place now .
all my best to your family , wish them strengh to go through this .
nitzah , uk rest in peace .
ad & d was the first role-playing system for me that i got attached to in early years of high-school in ' 92 .
in croatia , we did n't even have the real books at that time so we used bad copies of the copies supplemented with hand-written notes ...
i spent many nights with my closest friends roleplaying instead of sleeping in those days .
but we were not in a small room but someplace else , wielding swords and magic ...
it brings back dear and unique memories that only fellow role-players can understand .
thank you guys and condolences to the family .
marko gacesa , zagreb , croatia rest easy , mate .
you will be remembered .
thanks for many years of fun -lrb- since 77 -rrb- .
guess you finally failed your save . happens to all of us in the end. mark fitzgibbon , abu dhabi , uae thank you for your dreams and ideas that spawned d & d. i have the original and all the later editions .

nabil ben hariz ben hariz , thiais france due to arneson 's & gygax 's efforts i will forever cherish the hours & hours i spent huddled in my garage with 6 of my closest friends .

even if we are geeks : -rrb- tony mcqueen , portsmouth uk would just like to say that both dave and gary will be fondly remembered by me , as the " quintessential geek " mentioned in the article was me , and many of my friends at school playing the first d & d , then ad & d and moving on through the computer game genre -lrb- who remembers " valhalla " ? -rrb- which has become such a huge phenomenon , and which was single-handedly spawned by these two .

randall c. , alexandria , u.s.a. i was never much for rpgs but always had respect for people who played them .

stephen hennelly , berlin , germany i played dungeons and dragons as a teenager , and am one of the typical geeks who played it -lrb- i am a 39 year old software engineer -rrb- .
though the teachers of our high school actually banned it because they thought it " undermined our morals " we continued to meet and play in secret , with our painted lead figurines of thieves , paladins , assassins and various monsters .
we spent hours painting those figurines while listening to heavy metal .
i was just the other day considering taking it back up again and showed my girlfriend the wikipedia pages on the guys who invented d & d. rest in peace dave arneson and gary gygax .
lindsay kay , auckland , new zealand i was thirteen when i first played d & d. i 'm forty next month and like many who started then i 'm still playing now , thanks to dave and gary .

without them the world would have been a sadder place .
what else can i say except thanks .
rchard , valencia i must thank arneson and gygax for their creativity and imagination .
almost all of the fondest memories i have in my life are with my friends growing up , and almost every time we were together , nightly , religiously , we would be in my friend steve 's garage immersed in our make believe land within the realm of d & d. the game spawned my alter ego hexen soulblade , which followed me through most of middle school .
as humorous as it sounds , i will never forget the fun and togetherness i felt when we were were huddled at that table .
life and all of its stresses ceased to exist , and we were free in a far away land full of adventure and laughter and trials and triumph. only a game to some , but to me it was what kept us -lrb- myself and my family of friends -rrb- togeather , and happy .
thank you !
antonio periera -lrb- hexen soulblade -rrb- , seward , illinois , usa i guess you finally rolled a natural 1 .

hope you have fun in a very good place now .
all my best to your family , wish them strengh to go through this .
nitzah , uk rest in peace .
ad & d was the first role-playing system for me that i got attached to in early years of high-school in ' 92 .
in croatia , we did n't even have the real books at that time so we used bad copies of the copies supplemented with hand-written notes ...
i spent many nights with my closest friends roleplaying instead of sleeping in those days .
but we were not in a small room but someplace else , wielding swords and magic ...
it brings back dear and unique memories that only fellow role-players can understand .
thank you guys and condolences to the family .
marko gacesa , zagreb , croatia rest easy , mate .
you will be remembered .
thanks for many years of fun -lrb- since 77 -rrb- .
guess you finally failed your save . happens to all of us in the end. mark fitzgibbon , abu dhabi , uae thank you for your dreams and ideas that spawned d & d. i have the original and all the later editions .
your game kept me thinking and imagining , and made me friends .
i kept out of trouble because i just wanted 1 more adventure .
thank you .
save vs constitution , failed .
rest well and continue adventuring wherever you now may be .
keith tan , singapore rest in peace , you and gary gygax , and we never forget you .
nabil ben hariz ben hariz , thiais france due to arneson 's & gygax 's efforts i will forever cherish the hours & hours i spent huddled in my garage with 6 of my closest friends .
it was a wonderfully inventive way to spend a day with friends . even though one was a hair-brained barbarian that would never check for traps , and contributed in me losing my favorite sword . even now , though i have n't played in years , in the back of my closet , i still have my dice , manuals , dungeon maps , and character sheets ready if anyone happen to have a game going ? ?
anyone ? ?
you both shall be missed but never forgotten .
finneas macabre , usa , mississippi , biloxi as a long time and ardent fan of d & d / ad & d and now a veteran warcrafter in the 40 's bracket , this man and the late gary gygax have given me thousands of hours of fun , adventure , thrills in the comfort of my own imagination .
a great loss that will be felt by all that play the game past and present .
ian watson , dorset while many may disparage the validity or usefulness of role playing games , there is no way to overlook their gateway for loners into social groups .
awkward teens worldwide can find common ground in the escapism role playing provides .
i remember picking up the first edition of d & d when i was about ten and being awestruck by the world presented therein , as well as perplexed by the awkward d4 dice .
i 'm sure many have had similar experiences .
this shy and reserved individual has grown to be a productive and sociable member of the community , and i place a great deal of credit for that at the feet of these two men .
they spawned a universe of books , games , history , and friendships for me .
i wish more people had an understanding of the value and direction they 've provided across a wide stretch of all aspects of the entertainment industry .
d20s forever .
timothy roller , seattle , u.s.a. gary gygax and dave arneson did n't just invent a game , they invented a hobby that shaped my entire life .
my first memories of dungeons and dragons are of family games .
i was the dungeon master , father was a fighter , mother was an elf , and grandmother was a wizard .
i miss those cheerful days , and i 'll miss the men who made them possible .
chris nail , baton rouge , la , u.s.a. if i 'd had the chance in this life , i 'd have told dave arneson thanks for d & d and all the attendant good times i 've enjoyed with my friends as a result of playing the game .
my heartfelt condolences go out to the arneson family .
ewan cummins , usa rip .
i spent many hours with my friends enjoying rpg 's including mr. arneson 's games .
the quality of entertainment and thought he put into his games and game systems provided millions of people a popular and relaxing pastime .
that is his legacy .
he left the world much improved than he entered it .
in the end , that is all anyone can do. mike , buffalo , ny the true wizards have departed .
may your hit points always be copious .
