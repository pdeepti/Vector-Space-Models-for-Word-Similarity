" strategic progress relies on undermining the insurgency through politics , " miliband said as he called for " a political strategy for dealing with the insurgency through re-integration and reconciliation . "
in miliband 's view , the afghan insurgents are " a wide but shallow coalition of convenience , " and are therefore divisible .

borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

" strategic progress relies on undermining the insurgency through politics , " miliband said as he called for " a political strategy for dealing with the insurgency through re-integration and reconciliation . "
in miliband 's view , the afghan insurgents are " a wide but shallow coalition of convenience , " and are therefore divisible .
offering insurgents who would be willing to live under the afghan constitution a chance to lay down their arms , and a promise protect them against retribution from former comrades if they do so , miliband said , could turn the tide of the conflict .

" the lion 's share of these limited supplies will go to wealthy countries , " who director margaret chan said last week .
" again we see the advantage of affluence .
again we see access denied by an inability to pay . " high demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many rich countries have plans to vaccinate large swaths of the population the united states has set aside at least a billion dollars to buy vaccine , and britain hopes to protect at least half of its 60 million population by the start of next year and the other half as soon as possible thereafter . german states have said they intend to purchase 50 million doses of the drug and would consider buying more if the need arose .
health ministers agreed to buy mass vaccinations in september . france has placed a firm order for 94 million doses of vaccine doses and an option for 36 million more .
starting in october , it hopes to be able to protect each and every member of its population of 64 million . " we expressed our concern about being able to count on the vaccine when it starts going on sale , " argentina 's health minister juan manzur said last week after meeting worried latin american colleagues .
" we have information that much of the production is already reserved . " limited supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing medicine has , so far , been successful at treating the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus pharmaceutical firms are working to increase a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- vaccine production capacity , once tests confirm that the drug proves effective , and hope to begin releasing stocks by early october . some countries and independent experts have questioned whether immunizing every man , woman and child is an effective strategy and have called for authorities to focus on providing the vaccine to health workers and the most vulnerable patients in order to conserve stocks . that 's the plan that germany 's 16 states agreed to earlier this month when health ministers said they would get enough of the vaccine for a third of the german population . " vaccine for 30 percent of the population is enough to vaccinate the 7 million people in the health sector , another seven million in the public service and risk groups such as pregnant women or children , " peter wutzler , president of the german association for the fight against viral disease , told the afp news agency . mutation still possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus could become more - or less - dangerous if it mutates the who has said it is engaged in talks with pharmaceutical companies to donate or provide the drug to developing nations at lower cost .
the organization is also requesting highly industrialized nations to donate some of their stockpiled drugs to the developing world . the swine flu outbreak , which is officially called the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus because of its ability to infect many types of animals - not just pigs - has become " unstoppable , " a who official told the dpa news agency . more than 800 deaths have been linked to the virus , and though the who no longer provides figures on the number of infected people worldwide , swine flu has spread to 160 of the organization 's 193 member states . experts warn that the virus , which has largely been treated with two existing anti-flu drugs , might mutate and become more deadly .

a new era dawns at the bayreuth festival dark history still haunts bayreuth festival classical -pipe- 27.07.2009 the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner sisters have n't changed much - but at least they 're talking to each other the 98th bayreuth festival has started its process of renewal by turning on the charm and changing its tone after a long war of attrition with the german press . " artistic stagnation " was the catchword back when wolfgang wagner , soon to turn 90 , was still festival director . in year one of the co-directorship of his daughters eva wagner-pasquier , 64 , and katharina wagner , 31 , there is little new to be seen onstage - actually , nothing , with no new productions this season .
yet change is in the air , if only in that these two wagners are n't at loggerheads with each other . considering the worldwide obsession with this most authentic of opera festivals - 133 years after it was founded , still doing what its founder richard wagner intended it to - it 's unusual that its image was defined for so long by newspaper critics . wolfgang wagner , richard wagner 's grandson , loved to engage the press in a spirit of confrontation .
in the last fifteen years of his tenure , it turned bitter and reflexive . pr plus musical excellence great-granddaughter katharina wagner is responsible for having revamped the web site -lrb- www.bayreuther-festspiele.de -rrb- , and also directs the incorporated subsidiary bayreuth medien , which handles multimedia aspects of the festival . pre-empting the press and setting the agenda herself , she has said that she has a clear sense of where the festival should position itself : at the forefront of wagner interpretation worldwide . and that will require more than public relations . hopes are placed in the management expertise of eva wagner-pasquier , in the new conductors announced in the coming seasons -lrb- andris nelsons , thomas henglebrock and kirill petrenko -rrb- , and in the prospect that today 's handful of truly exciting wagnerian singers will be heard in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is taking place this year for the 98th time repeat boos for katharina considering that katharina was once again booed for her production of " mastersingers , " it may take some time for the new artistic approach to establish itself .
apparently her new position at the helm does n't give her any bonus points with the critical bayreuth audience . but the musical rendition of " mastersingers " does n't get lost in the stage antics - and that 's saying quite a bit , considering that katharina wagner basically turns the story upside down . in " mastersingers , " there 's quite a bit of singing about singing , as the story revolves around the craft of composition for the voice .
katharina came up with a piece of stage direction about stage direction , with references to the history , not all of it savory , of stagings of the " mastersingers " since the premiere over 140 years ago .
the work was , after all , a favorite in the third reich . to be understood , this meta-level commentary requires an audience that knows the score , the words and a context of different stagings .
katharina wagner can expect that of the bayreuth audience , yet she also goes beyond that small elite group of bayreuth ticket-holders , venturing into the worlds of local public viewing and internet broadcasting worldwide . beyond the green hill public viewing , simultaneous live stream and audio-on-demand continue with a different work on aug .
9 : christoph marthaler 's four-year-old setting of " tristan and isolde , " which opened the festival on july 25 . though bayreuth was late to jump on the multimedia bandwagon , bigger and better projects are reportedly in the works on the green hill . it was announced that the wagners are planning performances of their great-grandfather 's early works in the city of bayreuth -lrb- though not in the festspielhaus -rrb- , and that the new production of the ring cycle in the richard wagner bicentennial year 2013 will be publicly viewed and broadcast on the web . bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner 's daughters are softening the tone he set author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .
reiner holznagel from the taxpayers ' union , a pressure group , accused her of waffling : " mrs schmidt has gone back and forth .
" when we asked her on saturday , she said she was not using the official car for private purposes and that she had her own car on site .
in the meantime , the ministry said she was in fact using it for private purposes and was paying for it .
" the fact remains that the car had to go from berlin to alicante and that costs a lot of money , " holznagel told news channel n24 .

her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .
reiner holznagel from the taxpayers ' union , a pressure group , accused her of waffling : " mrs schmidt has gone back and forth .
" when we asked her on saturday , she said she was not using the official car for private purposes and that she had her own car on site .
in the meantime , the ministry said she was in fact using it for private purposes and was paying for it .
" the fact remains that the car had to go from berlin to alicante and that costs a lot of money , " holznagel told news channel n24 .
the timing of the growing scandal is unfortunate for the spd , which had hoped to use a quiet political week to gear up their election campaign , ahead of germany 's general election on september 27. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.07.2009 bulgarian parliament approves new government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borisov faces an uphill battle to curb corruption and get back in the eu 's favor bulgaria ’ s new prime minister , boiko borisov , was sworn in to office on monday , swearing to rein in systemic corruption and organized crime in hopes of convincing the eu his country should receive financial aid . three weeks following national elections in bulgaria , boiko borisov has been sworn in as the country 's new prime minister .
borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

diplomats also reassured balkan states on iceland 's eu aspirations . although howls of protests had been raised , european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday gave the ok for further negotiations between the eu and the us on a new agreement to allow american authorities continued access to bank transfer data in terrorism investigations . the eu commission and the united states consider providing access to banking data of the swift banking transfer service essential in uncovering the financing of terror networks . swift , the society of worldwide interbank financial telecommunications , is moving its primary server and database from the united states to the netherlands .
without a new agreement , the change of location would leave american officials with access only to information on americans .
the us would then have to ask individual eu countries for access to their data . the ministers approved a mandate for the european commission , the eu 's executive , to negotiate an agreement . german and european politicians from across the political spectrum have been vociferous in their condemnation of the proposed bank data transfer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting and greeting at the brussels pow-wow " it is completely disproportionate and excessive that banking data is to be transferred even if no suspicion exists , " said juergen trittin , german green party parliamentary group leader .
" that the eu wants to allow this kind of wholesale spying is not acceptable . " but law-enforcement officials on both sides of the atlantic have supported the data access , and the eu says us oversight has been an " important and effective tool " in fighting terrorism financing and preventing attacks . " it is no question of giving the us a blank check , as some critics seem to suggest , " eu justice commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" there is no unrestricted and unverified access ; on the contrary , there are clear rules and clear limits . " if the lisbon treaty comes into force in 2010 , as the eu hopes , the european parliament will have to approve any information sharing deals .
but the treaty would not come into effect until the end of the year at the earliest , leaving a gap of several months with the swift servers in europe .
during that time the us would have no access . that would be " extremely dangerous , " according to barrot , who said a temporary agreement lasting just a few months is needed .

her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .
reiner holznagel from the taxpayers ' union , a pressure group , accused her of waffling : " mrs schmidt has gone back and forth .
" when we asked her on saturday , she said she was not using the official car for private purposes and that she had her own car on site .
in the meantime , the ministry said she was in fact using it for private purposes and was paying for it .
" the fact remains that the car had to go from berlin to alicante and that costs a lot of money , " holznagel told news channel n24 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.07.2009 bulgarian parliament approves new government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borisov faces an uphill battle to curb corruption and get back in the eu 's favor bulgaria ’ s new prime minister , boiko borisov , was sworn in to office on monday , swearing to rein in systemic corruption and organized crime in hopes of convincing the eu his country should receive financial aid . three weeks following national elections in bulgaria , boiko borisov has been sworn in as the country 's new prime minister .
borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2009 iceland confident about eu membership talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skarphedinsson expects iceland to become a member within 3 years icelandic foreign minister ossur skarphedinsson says his country is in a strong position ahead of eu membership talks .
he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .

dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

" the lion 's share of these limited supplies will go to wealthy countries , " who director margaret chan said last week .

again we see access denied by an inability to pay . " high demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many rich countries have plans to vaccinate large swaths of the population the united states has set aside at least a billion dollars to buy vaccine , and britain hopes to protect at least half of its 60 million population by the start of next year and the other half as soon as possible thereafter . german states have said they intend to purchase 50 million doses of the drug and would consider buying more if the need arose .
health ministers agreed to buy mass vaccinations in september . france has placed a firm order for 94 million doses of vaccine doses and an option for 36 million more .
starting in october , it hopes to be able to protect each and every member of its population of 64 million . " we expressed our concern about being able to count on the vaccine when it starts going on sale , " argentina 's health minister juan manzur said last week after meeting worried latin american colleagues .

" vaccine for 30 percent of the population is enough to vaccinate the 7 million people in the health sector , another seven million in the public service and risk groups such as pregnant women or children , " peter wutzler , president of the german association for the fight against viral disease , told the afp news agency . mutation still possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus could become more - or less - dangerous if it mutates the who has said it is engaged in talks with pharmaceutical companies to donate or provide the drug to developing nations at lower cost .
the organization is also requesting highly industrialized nations to donate some of their stockpiled drugs to the developing world . the swine flu outbreak , which is officially called the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus because of its ability to infect many types of animals - not just pigs - has become " unstoppable , " a who official told the dpa news agency . more than 800 deaths have been linked to the virus , and though the who no longer provides figures on the number of infected people worldwide , swine flu has spread to 160 of the organization 's 193 member states . experts warn that the virus , which has largely been treated with two existing anti-flu drugs , might mutate and become more deadly .

in the last fifteen years of his tenure , it turned bitter and reflexive . pr plus musical excellence great-granddaughter katharina wagner is responsible for having revamped the web site -lrb- www.bayreuther-festspiele.de -rrb- , and also directs the incorporated subsidiary bayreuth medien , which handles multimedia aspects of the festival . pre-empting the press and setting the agenda herself , she has said that she has a clear sense of where the festival should position itself : at the forefront of wagner interpretation worldwide . and that will require more than public relations . hopes are placed in the management expertise of eva wagner-pasquier , in the new conductors announced in the coming seasons -lrb- andris nelsons , thomas henglebrock and kirill petrenko -rrb- , and in the prospect that today 's handful of truly exciting wagnerian singers will be heard in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is taking place this year for the 98th time repeat boos for katharina considering that katharina was once again booed for her production of " mastersingers , " it may take some time for the new artistic approach to establish itself .
apparently her new position at the helm does n't give her any bonus points with the critical bayreuth audience . but the musical rendition of " mastersingers " does n't get lost in the stage antics - and that 's saying quite a bit , considering that katharina wagner basically turns the story upside down . in " mastersingers , " there 's quite a bit of singing about singing , as the story revolves around the craft of composition for the voice .
katharina came up with a piece of stage direction about stage direction , with references to the history , not all of it savory , of stagings of the " mastersingers " since the premiere over 140 years ago .
the work was , after all , a favorite in the third reich . to be understood , this meta-level commentary requires an audience that knows the score , the words and a context of different stagings .
katharina wagner can expect that of the bayreuth audience , yet she also goes beyond that small elite group of bayreuth ticket-holders , venturing into the worlds of local public viewing and internet broadcasting worldwide . beyond the green hill public viewing , simultaneous live stream and audio-on-demand continue with a different work on aug .
9 : christoph marthaler 's four-year-old setting of " tristan and isolde , " which opened the festival on july 25 . though bayreuth was late to jump on the multimedia bandwagon , bigger and better projects are reportedly in the works on the green hill . it was announced that the wagners are planning performances of their great-grandfather 's early works in the city of bayreuth -lrb- though not in the festspielhaus -rrb- , and that the new production of the ring cycle in the richard wagner bicentennial year 2013 will be publicly viewed and broadcast on the web . bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner 's daughters are softening the tone he set author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2009 iceland confident about eu membership talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skarphedinsson expects iceland to become a member within 3 years icelandic foreign minister ossur skarphedinsson says his country is in a strong position ahead of eu membership talks .
he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

by working for charitable organisations they aim to improve their social skills and change corporate culture . barbara zastrozynski works for a large insurance company in duesseldorf .
she 's an it manager in charge of a team of more than 50 employees .
as part of a training program for her company she volunteered to take part in changing sides – for a week she 's working with homeless people .
" i was very curious about the whole thing , " she says .
" as an executive you get to view people more and more simply as a resource .
so my interest was to get back to seeing people as people , rather than resources that we allocate to this or that job . "
for a week she 's been helping to hand out food and coffee in a soup kitchen and taken part in counselling sessions .
she was surrounded by people and problems she would never have encountered in her own life .
she said it was like living in a different world with men and women who have to struggle for survival on a daily basis .
" i was deeply moved by what i 've seen .
especially that day i spent with the streetworkers outside – we 've been to places i 'd never been to before , met people i never had contact with before , " she says .
strengthening corporate culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : challenges faced by the homeless make those faced by managers seem minor the idea behind changing sides comes from switzerland .
it was developed especially for to executives , with the goal of strengthening their social skills .
nine years ago , the concept was introduced in germany .
maria wrede of a volunteers organisation in cologne , is head of the local changing sides project .
" it 's very important that companies realize that they have a social responsibility .
and they can fulfil that responsibility only through their employees .
the best place to start is at the top , to provide a good example .
this will help corporate culture and strengthen ethics within the company , " wrede says .
so far , around 1,000 managers have participated in the program , the insurance company where barbara zastrozynksi works sends people on a regular basis to spend a week with the changing sides program .
mario vaupel is head of human resources at the insurance giant .
" it 's quite important for the management to see that there are other areas in life where ' managing ' is also very difficult , " he explains .
" the problems and challenges that a drug addict faces are much more difficult and they still have to get by .
we are convinced that our management can really learn something from that experience .
they see how comparatively easy their daily tasks are if viewed from a completely different perspective . "
vaupel is in charge of selecting and sending the companies managers to take part in changing sides .
the cost is 2,500 euros per person , but he 's convinced that in the end the company can profit from that investment .
his goal is that even more of the staff take part in the program so that a growing sense of social responsibility can impact on the corporate culture on a wider basis .

" strategic progress relies on undermining the insurgency through politics , " miliband said as he called for " a political strategy for dealing with the insurgency through re-integration and reconciliation . "
in miliband 's view , the afghan insurgents are " a wide but shallow coalition of convenience , " and are therefore divisible .
offering insurgents who would be willing to live under the afghan constitution a chance to lay down their arms , and a promise protect them against retribution from former comrades if they do so , miliband said , could turn the tide of the conflict .
sharing the load miliband also called for greater burden-sharing among nations contributing troops to the war effort .
britain currently has 9,000 troops serving in the alliance 's military operations in afghanistan , the second-largest contingent there after the us .
but the afghan mission has come under renewed scrutiny in the uk following the deaths of 20 british soldiers in july so far , the bloodiest month for the contingent since the afghan mission began .
the german public has long been reluctant to back a more active military mission in afghanistan , but circumstances may force their commanders ' hands .
in recent weeks , taliban militants have increased their attacks on afghan and german troops in the north of the country , and the bundeswehr has been fighting back .
the past week has seen a new offensive launched in kunduz province , involving afghan soldiers and 300 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s quick reaction force. mrh / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . anyone who does n't know the berlin art scene well probably imagines it as being centred around small , hidden entrances leading into dilapidated buildings whose exteriors are liberally covered with graffiti .
the interior is inevitably in an equally poor condition , with pictures - selected by a young person who looks barely old enough to have completed university - hanging on crumbling walls . at least in one case , that stereotype described reality to a t - at styx gallery in berlin . michael rade is 26 years old and has been managing his own art gallery for a year . between prenzlauer berg and friedrichshein , rade 's gallery is located at the heart of the district that the berlin art scene calls home . an unlikely mixture : beer and art the styx gallery is housed in a massive building that used to be a former brewery .
naturally , it 's covered in graffiti . after opening the door with a cardboard sign reading " artists.com " on it , one is immediately hit by a damp , musty smell , no doubt caused by the small puddle of rainwater collecting near the entrance .
the next sense to be attacked is the hearing .
from an unknown corner , a radio fills the room with spanish music while hammering and knocking emanates from another part of the building . bildunterschrift : renovation would ruin the gallery 's atmosphere , says michael rade a trail of candles the words " just keep following the candlelight " echo from the other end of the gloomy corridor , followed by " the electricity is out today . "
due to this unexpected development , rade has arranged a trail of candles leading into his gallery . there , he sits in one corner of the 120-square-meter -lrb- nearly 11-square-foot -rrb- whitewashed room he ironically calls the " white cube . "
ironically - because the modern , clinically clean atmosphere that a " white cube gallery " conjures up does n't have anything to do with the poorly plastered walls and small windows in this place . london was a " tough nut to crack " a typical 26-year-old , one would think , has just finished his studies , is taking the first tentative steps towards a career , and may occasionally visit the odd art gallery .
but rade already has all of this behind him . in his quiet voice he tells how , after having completed his graphic design studies in hamburg , he was pulled towards london , one of the iconic style capitals of the world .
there he began to organize art exhibitions for friends until he realized that the london art scene " is a tough nut to crack . " then he discovered the white cube in berlin and one thing was clear : this would become his new gallery . bildunterschrift : the entrance to the " white cube " a matter of taste currently , styx is displaying the work of london-based artist emc collard , who rade knows personally from his time there .
but this is not normal practice in his gallery . typically , rade comes across artists over the internet and , if he likes their work , arranges a meeting to discuss a possible exhibition . if a deal is reached , the artist receives 50 percent of any piece sold , while the young curator keeps the other half . all artists whose work he has exhibited are also featured on his web site . " that is the least that i can do form them , " says stade . " i ca n't represent them at art conventions and i do n't yet have a portfolio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 27.07.2009 eu top diplomats ok bank data talks , reassure on iceland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign ministers ok 'd talks on a new agreement on sharing eu banking data with the us eu foreign ministers have given the green light to talks with the us about access to bank details in terrorism investigations .
diplomats also reassured balkan states on iceland 's eu aspirations . although howls of protests had been raised , european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday gave the ok for further negotiations between the eu and the us on a new agreement to allow american authorities continued access to bank transfer data in terrorism investigations . the eu commission and the united states consider providing access to banking data of the swift banking transfer service essential in uncovering the financing of terror networks . swift , the society of worldwide interbank financial telecommunications , is moving its primary server and database from the united states to the netherlands .
without a new agreement , the change of location would leave american officials with access only to information on americans .
the us would then have to ask individual eu countries for access to their data . the ministers approved a mandate for the european commission , the eu 's executive , to negotiate an agreement . german and european politicians from across the political spectrum have been vociferous in their condemnation of the proposed bank data transfer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting and greeting at the brussels pow-wow " it is completely disproportionate and excessive that banking data is to be transferred even if no suspicion exists , " said juergen trittin , german green party parliamentary group leader .
" that the eu wants to allow this kind of wholesale spying is not acceptable . " but law-enforcement officials on both sides of the atlantic have supported the data access , and the eu says us oversight has been an " important and effective tool " in fighting terrorism financing and preventing attacks . " it is no question of giving the us a blank check , as some critics seem to suggest , " eu justice commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" there is no unrestricted and unverified access ; on the contrary , there are clear rules and clear limits . " if the lisbon treaty comes into force in 2010 , as the eu hopes , the european parliament will have to approve any information sharing deals .
but the treaty would not come into effect until the end of the year at the earliest , leaving a gap of several months with the swift servers in europe .
during that time the us would have no access . that would be " extremely dangerous , " according to barrot , who said a temporary agreement lasting just a few months is needed .
if and when the lisbon treaty comes into force , a new deal will have to be drawn up and approved by the eu parliament . easing fears on iceland eu ministers also sought to reassure balkan countries eager to the join the bloc that iceland would not get special treatment and would undergo the same membership tests as them . while iceland has traditionally been uninterested in eu membership , the north atlantic island nation has seen its economy devastated by the global financial crisis and many there feel eu membership would boost its financial stability . bildunterschrift : iceland already fulfills many requirements for eu membership while eu accession negotiations generally take years , iceland 's eu path is expected to be shorter and smoother than most because of its long democratic tradition and existing treaties and agreements it already has with the eu .
iceland is a member of the european free trade association and the european economic area trading groups . however , on monday , the eu 's current president , sweden , said iceland can not expect fast-track entry . " there is no fast-track for iceland but rather a shorter track because they are already a part of the single market and the schengen area , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt told reporters ahead of monday 's meeting . bildt said iceland 's eu ambitions should not overshadow those of the balkan states . " we need to focus on the western balkans , " he said , referring to the former yugoslav countries and albania .
only one of those , slovenia , is currently an eu member . " there is a need for momentum on european integration in the balkans , " he said . british foreign secretary david miliband agreed : " there is no chance of the balkans being forgotten , " he said .
" it is not about one country being privileged over another , it is about all countries being treated equally and fairly . " global hot spots the around 200 unarmed eu ceasefire monitors in georgia posted there since the country 's war with its russia-backed breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia last year will stay until at least september 2010 , the foreign ministers agreed . " the mission 's presence on the ground remains a key stabilizing factor , " read a joint statement approved at the brussels meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu observers have been on the ground in georgia since last august 's conflict with russia the eu mission is the only international mission on the ground in georgia now , since russia vetoed the extension of un and osce observer missions that had been there previously . the eu " noted with deep regret and concern that agreement has not been reached on the future of the un and osce monitoring missions in georgia .
this development further underscores the crucial role of eumm georgia , " the statement said , referring to the eu monitoring mission . keeping in line with a united nations resolution , the eu adopted reinforced sanctions against north korea over its nuclear and weapons tests . the ministers passed without discussion a move to enforce un security council resolution 1874 " in a robust way as requested " by eu leaders at a summit last month , a statement said . the eu decided , in addition to un sanctions , on the " autonomous listing of items subject to export ban , autonomous listing of persons and entities subject to travel ban and asset freeze , enhanced financial vigilance and reinforced cargo inspections . " north korea quit six-party talks aimed at ending its nuclear weapons program after the security council censured it for a long-range rocket launch in april .

low inflation leads to increased spending and despite the ongoing recession , most people seem to expect the crisis to be over soon . consumers have pinned their hopes on an early end to the crisis .
a closely watched study on consumer confidence suggests that a combination of economic optimism and record-low inflation has german consumer confidence surging in august .
the forward-looking gfk index , which was released on monday , rose to an estimated 3.5 points for august from 3.0 in july .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending their money , rather than saving it " after some economic institutes signalled an end to the economic downturn , the economic pessimism on the part of the consumers has also declined .
inflation is disappearing and people have more money in their pockets , " says the report .
inflation in germany had hit a record of zero percent in may , in june inflation stood at 0.1 percent .
analysts even predict falling prices for the coming summer months - a phenomenon not seen for more than 20 years .
at the same time , interest rates offered by banks are lower than they have been for years so that there 's little incentive for people to keep their money in the bank .
stable prices have managed to trigger consumer spending - especially on larger purchases like household appliances and home entertainment .
the government 's program in which it pays cash to people who scrap their old cars for new models has lead to a surge in automobile purchases .
rising unemployment threatens to reverse confidence another reason for the upbeat view of the country 's economic prospects is the fact that unemployment has not yet risen to the extent many had feared it would .
experts however warn of a sharp rise in unemployment in the months to come as soon as the global recession starts to catch up with germany 's labour market .
the assumption that the steep economic downturn has come to an end could therefore be premature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising unemployment in the autumn could dampen the optimism " the acid test for the consumer climate still lies ahead .
a long-lasting stabilisation of the consumer climate will depend on how the labor market develops in the future .
if the unemployment figures climb high in late autumn , this will be a test for consumer confidence , " the report says , adding that based on a long-term comparison , the consumer climate index is still at a very low level .
the gfk report comes only days after a report that german business confidence improved for the fourth consecutive month in july . on friday , the business climate index released by the institute for economic research -lrb- ifo -rrb- exceeded economists ' expectations by rising to 87.3 points after reaching a seven-month high in june of 85.9. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.07.2009 german health minister defends use of government car while on vacation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt may yet regret bringing her car down to spain after the theft of her government issued mercedes in spain , ulla schmidt is on the hot seat about why the car was even there in the first place . german health minister ulla schmidt defended monday her use of a chauffeur-driven government car while on holiday in alicante , spain , as friction grew within chancellor angela merkel 's government over the matter , which came to light when the car was stolen after her driver 's hotel room was burglarized .
her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .
reiner holznagel from the taxpayers ' union , a pressure group , accused her of waffling : " mrs schmidt has gone back and forth .
" when we asked her on saturday , she said she was not using the official car for private purposes and that she had her own car on site .
in the meantime , the ministry said she was in fact using it for private purposes and was paying for it .
" the fact remains that the car had to go from berlin to alicante and that costs a lot of money , " holznagel told news channel n24 .
the timing of the growing scandal is unfortunate for the spd , which had hoped to use a quiet political week to gear up their election campaign , ahead of germany 's general election on september 27. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for a week she 's been helping to hand out food and coffee in a soup kitchen and taken part in counselling sessions .
she was surrounded by people and problems she would never have encountered in her own life .

" strategic progress relies on undermining the insurgency through politics , " miliband said as he called for " a political strategy for dealing with the insurgency through re-integration and reconciliation . "
in miliband 's view , the afghan insurgents are " a wide but shallow coalition of convenience , " and are therefore divisible .
offering insurgents who would be willing to live under the afghan constitution a chance to lay down their arms , and a promise protect them against retribution from former comrades if they do so , miliband said , could turn the tide of the conflict .
sharing the load miliband also called for greater burden-sharing among nations contributing troops to the war effort .
britain currently has 9,000 troops serving in the alliance 's military operations in afghanistan , the second-largest contingent there after the us .
but the afghan mission has come under renewed scrutiny in the uk following the deaths of 20 british soldiers in july so far , the bloodiest month for the contingent since the afghan mission began .
the german public has long been reluctant to back a more active military mission in afghanistan , but circumstances may force their commanders ' hands .
in recent weeks , taliban militants have increased their attacks on afghan and german troops in the north of the country , and the bundeswehr has been fighting back .
the past week has seen a new offensive launched in kunduz province , involving afghan soldiers and 300 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s quick reaction force. mrh / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

distanced from the establishment , they are the real avant-garde of the art world .
this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . anyone who does n't know the berlin art scene well probably imagines it as being centred around small , hidden entrances leading into dilapidated buildings whose exteriors are liberally covered with graffiti .
the interior is inevitably in an equally poor condition , with pictures - selected by a young person who looks barely old enough to have completed university - hanging on crumbling walls . at least in one case , that stereotype described reality to a t - at styx gallery in berlin . michael rade is 26 years old and has been managing his own art gallery for a year . between prenzlauer berg and friedrichshein , rade 's gallery is located at the heart of the district that the berlin art scene calls home . an unlikely mixture : beer and art the styx gallery is housed in a massive building that used to be a former brewery .
naturally , it 's covered in graffiti . after opening the door with a cardboard sign reading " artists.com " on it , one is immediately hit by a damp , musty smell , no doubt caused by the small puddle of rainwater collecting near the entrance .
the next sense to be attacked is the hearing .
from an unknown corner , a radio fills the room with spanish music while hammering and knocking emanates from another part of the building . bildunterschrift : renovation would ruin the gallery 's atmosphere , says michael rade a trail of candles the words " just keep following the candlelight " echo from the other end of the gloomy corridor , followed by " the electricity is out today . "
due to this unexpected development , rade has arranged a trail of candles leading into his gallery . there , he sits in one corner of the 120-square-meter -lrb- nearly 11-square-foot -rrb- whitewashed room he ironically calls the " white cube . "
ironically - because the modern , clinically clean atmosphere that a " white cube gallery " conjures up does n't have anything to do with the poorly plastered walls and small windows in this place . london was a " tough nut to crack " a typical 26-year-old , one would think , has just finished his studies , is taking the first tentative steps towards a career , and may occasionally visit the odd art gallery .
but rade already has all of this behind him . in his quiet voice he tells how , after having completed his graphic design studies in hamburg , he was pulled towards london , one of the iconic style capitals of the world .
there he began to organize art exhibitions for friends until he realized that the london art scene " is a tough nut to crack . " then he discovered the white cube in berlin and one thing was clear : this would become his new gallery . bildunterschrift : the entrance to the " white cube " a matter of taste currently , styx is displaying the work of london-based artist emc collard , who rade knows personally from his time there .
but this is not normal practice in his gallery . typically , rade comes across artists over the internet and , if he likes their work , arranges a meeting to discuss a possible exhibition . if a deal is reached , the artist receives 50 percent of any piece sold , while the young curator keeps the other half . all artists whose work he has exhibited are also featured on his web site . " that is the least that i can do form them , " says stade . " i ca n't represent them at art conventions and i do n't yet have a portfolio . " nevertheless , some of the artists have been able to utilize styx as a springboard to more prestigious endeavors . bildunterschrift : rade keeps half of what the artwork sells for renovation awaits though he 's just gotten started , rade has already enjoyed considerable success with his small gallery . between 50 and 300 visitors attend each exhibition 's grand opening and each piece from his current display sells for anywhere between 490 and 3,300 euros . but whether styx can grow and become a major player in the berlin art scene is doubtful . the former brewery belongs to an investor who occasionally pops by to see how the young curator is doing . he currently plans to have the white cube renovated , which would mean rade would have to relocate - a prospect he 's not looking forward to . if the walls are replastered , the holes in the roof plugged , and the graffiti removed , the " great charm " of the building would be lost forever , says rade . authors : elena singer / andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2009 iceland confident about eu membership talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skarphedinsson expects iceland to become a member within 3 years icelandic foreign minister ossur skarphedinsson says his country is in a strong position ahead of eu membership talks .
he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .

the ship and its 220-strong crew is heading for the horn of africa to take part in the european union 's atalanta mission to tackle piracy in some of the world 's most dangerous waters .
on august 11 , after arriving at the naval station at djibouti , the bremen is to take over the duties of the frigate rheinland-pfalz , which has , along with another frigate , the brandenburg , been representing germany 's navy in the eu-wide mission .
the bremen is to be primarily assigned to protect ships making runs to somalia for the united nations ' world food program , but it is also to help keep shipping lanes open for other ships as needed . problems remain over the past two years , pirates along somalia 's 3,100-kilometer coast have hijacked dozens of ships for ransom payments worth millions of dollars .
eu foreign ministers decided last month to extend the mission , which involves 14 ships , by a year , until the end of 2010 .
there are around 500 german military personnel involved in the mission .
since the operation began in december , eu-flagged vessels have detained more than 50 suspected pirates , whom they have handed over to the kenyan authorities in line with a deal reached in march. mrh / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

diplomats also reassured balkan states on iceland 's eu aspirations . although howls of protests had been raised , european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday gave the ok for further negotiations between the eu and the us on a new agreement to allow american authorities continued access to bank transfer data in terrorism investigations . the eu commission and the united states consider providing access to banking data of the swift banking transfer service essential in uncovering the financing of terror networks . swift , the society of worldwide interbank financial telecommunications , is moving its primary server and database from the united states to the netherlands .
without a new agreement , the change of location would leave american officials with access only to information on americans .
the us would then have to ask individual eu countries for access to their data . the ministers approved a mandate for the european commission , the eu 's executive , to negotiate an agreement . german and european politicians from across the political spectrum have been vociferous in their condemnation of the proposed bank data transfer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting and greeting at the brussels pow-wow " it is completely disproportionate and excessive that banking data is to be transferred even if no suspicion exists , " said juergen trittin , german green party parliamentary group leader .
" that the eu wants to allow this kind of wholesale spying is not acceptable . " but law-enforcement officials on both sides of the atlantic have supported the data access , and the eu says us oversight has been an " important and effective tool " in fighting terrorism financing and preventing attacks . " it is no question of giving the us a blank check , as some critics seem to suggest , " eu justice commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" there is no unrestricted and unverified access ; on the contrary , there are clear rules and clear limits . " if the lisbon treaty comes into force in 2010 , as the eu hopes , the european parliament will have to approve any information sharing deals .
but the treaty would not come into effect until the end of the year at the earliest , leaving a gap of several months with the swift servers in europe .
during that time the us would have no access . that would be " extremely dangerous , " according to barrot , who said a temporary agreement lasting just a few months is needed .
if and when the lisbon treaty comes into force , a new deal will have to be drawn up and approved by the eu parliament . easing fears on iceland eu ministers also sought to reassure balkan countries eager to the join the bloc that iceland would not get special treatment and would undergo the same membership tests as them . while iceland has traditionally been uninterested in eu membership , the north atlantic island nation has seen its economy devastated by the global financial crisis and many there feel eu membership would boost its financial stability . bildunterschrift : iceland already fulfills many requirements for eu membership while eu accession negotiations generally take years , iceland 's eu path is expected to be shorter and smoother than most because of its long democratic tradition and existing treaties and agreements it already has with the eu .
iceland is a member of the european free trade association and the european economic area trading groups . however , on monday , the eu 's current president , sweden , said iceland can not expect fast-track entry . " there is no fast-track for iceland but rather a shorter track because they are already a part of the single market and the schengen area , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt told reporters ahead of monday 's meeting . bildt said iceland 's eu ambitions should not overshadow those of the balkan states . " we need to focus on the western balkans , " he said , referring to the former yugoslav countries and albania .
only one of those , slovenia , is currently an eu member . " there is a need for momentum on european integration in the balkans , " he said . british foreign secretary david miliband agreed : " there is no chance of the balkans being forgotten , " he said .
" it is not about one country being privileged over another , it is about all countries being treated equally and fairly . " global hot spots the around 200 unarmed eu ceasefire monitors in georgia posted there since the country 's war with its russia-backed breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia last year will stay until at least september 2010 , the foreign ministers agreed . " the mission 's presence on the ground remains a key stabilizing factor , " read a joint statement approved at the brussels meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu observers have been on the ground in georgia since last august 's conflict with russia the eu mission is the only international mission on the ground in georgia now , since russia vetoed the extension of un and osce observer missions that had been there previously . the eu " noted with deep regret and concern that agreement has not been reached on the future of the un and osce monitoring missions in georgia .
this development further underscores the crucial role of eumm georgia , " the statement said , referring to the eu monitoring mission . keeping in line with a united nations resolution , the eu adopted reinforced sanctions against north korea over its nuclear and weapons tests . the ministers passed without discussion a move to enforce un security council resolution 1874 " in a robust way as requested " by eu leaders at a summit last month , a statement said . the eu decided , in addition to un sanctions , on the " autonomous listing of items subject to export ban , autonomous listing of persons and entities subject to travel ban and asset freeze , enhanced financial vigilance and reinforced cargo inspections . " north korea quit six-party talks aimed at ending its nuclear weapons program after the security council censured it for a long-range rocket launch in april .

naturally , it 's covered in graffiti . after opening the door with a cardboard sign reading " artists.com " on it , one is immediately hit by a damp , musty smell , no doubt caused by the small puddle of rainwater collecting near the entrance .

but rade already has all of this behind him . in his quiet voice he tells how , after having completed his graphic design studies in hamburg , he was pulled towards london , one of the iconic style capitals of the world .

distanced from the establishment , they are the real avant-garde of the art world .
this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . anyone who does n't know the berlin art scene well probably imagines it as being centred around small , hidden entrances leading into dilapidated buildings whose exteriors are liberally covered with graffiti .
the interior is inevitably in an equally poor condition , with pictures - selected by a young person who looks barely old enough to have completed university - hanging on crumbling walls . at least in one case , that stereotype described reality to a t - at styx gallery in berlin . michael rade is 26 years old and has been managing his own art gallery for a year . between prenzlauer berg and friedrichshein , rade 's gallery is located at the heart of the district that the berlin art scene calls home . an unlikely mixture : beer and art the styx gallery is housed in a massive building that used to be a former brewery .
naturally , it 's covered in graffiti . after opening the door with a cardboard sign reading " artists.com " on it , one is immediately hit by a damp , musty smell , no doubt caused by the small puddle of rainwater collecting near the entrance .
the next sense to be attacked is the hearing .
from an unknown corner , a radio fills the room with spanish music while hammering and knocking emanates from another part of the building . bildunterschrift : renovation would ruin the gallery 's atmosphere , says michael rade a trail of candles the words " just keep following the candlelight " echo from the other end of the gloomy corridor , followed by " the electricity is out today . "
due to this unexpected development , rade has arranged a trail of candles leading into his gallery . there , he sits in one corner of the 120-square-meter -lrb- nearly 11-square-foot -rrb- whitewashed room he ironically calls the " white cube . "
ironically - because the modern , clinically clean atmosphere that a " white cube gallery " conjures up does n't have anything to do with the poorly plastered walls and small windows in this place . london was a " tough nut to crack " a typical 26-year-old , one would think , has just finished his studies , is taking the first tentative steps towards a career , and may occasionally visit the odd art gallery .
but rade already has all of this behind him . in his quiet voice he tells how , after having completed his graphic design studies in hamburg , he was pulled towards london , one of the iconic style capitals of the world .
there he began to organize art exhibitions for friends until he realized that the london art scene " is a tough nut to crack . " then he discovered the white cube in berlin and one thing was clear : this would become his new gallery . bildunterschrift : the entrance to the " white cube " a matter of taste currently , styx is displaying the work of london-based artist emc collard , who rade knows personally from his time there .
but this is not normal practice in his gallery . typically , rade comes across artists over the internet and , if he likes their work , arranges a meeting to discuss a possible exhibition . if a deal is reached , the artist receives 50 percent of any piece sold , while the young curator keeps the other half . all artists whose work he has exhibited are also featured on his web site . " that is the least that i can do form them , " says stade . " i ca n't represent them at art conventions and i do n't yet have a portfolio . " nevertheless , some of the artists have been able to utilize styx as a springboard to more prestigious endeavors . bildunterschrift : rade keeps half of what the artwork sells for renovation awaits though he 's just gotten started , rade has already enjoyed considerable success with his small gallery . between 50 and 300 visitors attend each exhibition 's grand opening and each piece from his current display sells for anywhere between 490 and 3,300 euros . but whether styx can grow and become a major player in the berlin art scene is doubtful . the former brewery belongs to an investor who occasionally pops by to see how the young curator is doing . he currently plans to have the white cube renovated , which would mean rade would have to relocate - a prospect he 's not looking forward to . if the walls are replastered , the holes in the roof plugged , and the graffiti removed , the " great charm " of the building would be lost forever , says rade . authors : elena singer / andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

continued high temperatures around the mediterranean however , are turning forests dry and creating conditions for more fires . the worst affected countries were spain , france and italy and most of the blazes in those nations are now under control , but firefighters continue to remain on alert .
as an example , a fire that was thought to be under control near the spanish town of las hurdes flared up again due to strong winds and that forced the evacuation of more than 500 people .
the blaze burned over 500 hectares .
as temperatures remain high , spain 's interior ministry has kept the country on high alert for more wildfires .
the national weather office has issued an " orange " alert , the second highest level , for 24 provinces .
spanish officials said that roughly 24,000 hectares have been burned and six people have lost their lives over the last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2009 iceland confident about eu membership talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skarphedinsson expects iceland to become a member within 3 years icelandic foreign minister ossur skarphedinsson says his country is in a strong position ahead of eu membership talks .
he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.07.2009 bulgarian parliament approves new government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borisov faces an uphill battle to curb corruption and get back in the eu 's favor bulgaria ’ s new prime minister , boiko borisov , was sworn in to office on monday , swearing to rein in systemic corruption and organized crime in hopes of convincing the eu his country should receive financial aid . three weeks following national elections in bulgaria , boiko borisov has been sworn in as the country 's new prime minister .
borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.07.2009 bulgarian parliament approves new government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borisov faces an uphill battle to curb corruption and get back in the eu 's favor bulgaria ’ s new prime minister , boiko borisov , was sworn in to office on monday , swearing to rein in systemic corruption and organized crime in hopes of convincing the eu his country should receive financial aid . three weeks following national elections in bulgaria , boiko borisov has been sworn in as the country 's new prime minister .
borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

diplomats also reassured balkan states on iceland 's eu aspirations . although howls of protests had been raised , european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday gave the ok for further negotiations between the eu and the us on a new agreement to allow american authorities continued access to bank transfer data in terrorism investigations . the eu commission and the united states consider providing access to banking data of the swift banking transfer service essential in uncovering the financing of terror networks . swift , the society of worldwide interbank financial telecommunications , is moving its primary server and database from the united states to the netherlands .
without a new agreement , the change of location would leave american officials with access only to information on americans .
the us would then have to ask individual eu countries for access to their data . the ministers approved a mandate for the european commission , the eu 's executive , to negotiate an agreement . german and european politicians from across the political spectrum have been vociferous in their condemnation of the proposed bank data transfer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting and greeting at the brussels pow-wow " it is completely disproportionate and excessive that banking data is to be transferred even if no suspicion exists , " said juergen trittin , german green party parliamentary group leader .
" that the eu wants to allow this kind of wholesale spying is not acceptable . " but law-enforcement officials on both sides of the atlantic have supported the data access , and the eu says us oversight has been an " important and effective tool " in fighting terrorism financing and preventing attacks . " it is no question of giving the us a blank check , as some critics seem to suggest , " eu justice commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" there is no unrestricted and unverified access ; on the contrary , there are clear rules and clear limits . " if the lisbon treaty comes into force in 2010 , as the eu hopes , the european parliament will have to approve any information sharing deals .
but the treaty would not come into effect until the end of the year at the earliest , leaving a gap of several months with the swift servers in europe .
during that time the us would have no access . that would be " extremely dangerous , " according to barrot , who said a temporary agreement lasting just a few months is needed .
if and when the lisbon treaty comes into force , a new deal will have to be drawn up and approved by the eu parliament . easing fears on iceland eu ministers also sought to reassure balkan countries eager to the join the bloc that iceland would not get special treatment and would undergo the same membership tests as them . while iceland has traditionally been uninterested in eu membership , the north atlantic island nation has seen its economy devastated by the global financial crisis and many there feel eu membership would boost its financial stability . bildunterschrift : iceland already fulfills many requirements for eu membership while eu accession negotiations generally take years , iceland 's eu path is expected to be shorter and smoother than most because of its long democratic tradition and existing treaties and agreements it already has with the eu .
iceland is a member of the european free trade association and the european economic area trading groups . however , on monday , the eu 's current president , sweden , said iceland can not expect fast-track entry . " there is no fast-track for iceland but rather a shorter track because they are already a part of the single market and the schengen area , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt told reporters ahead of monday 's meeting . bildt said iceland 's eu ambitions should not overshadow those of the balkan states . " we need to focus on the western balkans , " he said , referring to the former yugoslav countries and albania .
only one of those , slovenia , is currently an eu member . " there is a need for momentum on european integration in the balkans , " he said . british foreign secretary david miliband agreed : " there is no chance of the balkans being forgotten , " he said .
" it is not about one country being privileged over another , it is about all countries being treated equally and fairly . " global hot spots the around 200 unarmed eu ceasefire monitors in georgia posted there since the country 's war with its russia-backed breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia last year will stay until at least september 2010 , the foreign ministers agreed . " the mission 's presence on the ground remains a key stabilizing factor , " read a joint statement approved at the brussels meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu observers have been on the ground in georgia since last august 's conflict with russia the eu mission is the only international mission on the ground in georgia now , since russia vetoed the extension of un and osce observer missions that had been there previously . the eu " noted with deep regret and concern that agreement has not been reached on the future of the un and osce monitoring missions in georgia .
this development further underscores the crucial role of eumm georgia , " the statement said , referring to the eu monitoring mission . keeping in line with a united nations resolution , the eu adopted reinforced sanctions against north korea over its nuclear and weapons tests . the ministers passed without discussion a move to enforce un security council resolution 1874 " in a robust way as requested " by eu leaders at a summit last month , a statement said . the eu decided , in addition to un sanctions , on the " autonomous listing of items subject to export ban , autonomous listing of persons and entities subject to travel ban and asset freeze , enhanced financial vigilance and reinforced cargo inspections . " north korea quit six-party talks aimed at ending its nuclear weapons program after the security council censured it for a long-range rocket launch in april .

" the lion 's share of these limited supplies will go to wealthy countries , " who director margaret chan said last week .
" again we see the advantage of affluence .
again we see access denied by an inability to pay . " high demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many rich countries have plans to vaccinate large swaths of the population the united states has set aside at least a billion dollars to buy vaccine , and britain hopes to protect at least half of its 60 million population by the start of next year and the other half as soon as possible thereafter . german states have said they intend to purchase 50 million doses of the drug and would consider buying more if the need arose .
health ministers agreed to buy mass vaccinations in september . france has placed a firm order for 94 million doses of vaccine doses and an option for 36 million more .
starting in october , it hopes to be able to protect each and every member of its population of 64 million . " we expressed our concern about being able to count on the vaccine when it starts going on sale , " argentina 's health minister juan manzur said last week after meeting worried latin american colleagues .
" we have information that much of the production is already reserved . " limited supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing medicine has , so far , been successful at treating the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus pharmaceutical firms are working to increase a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- vaccine production capacity , once tests confirm that the drug proves effective , and hope to begin releasing stocks by early october . some countries and independent experts have questioned whether immunizing every man , woman and child is an effective strategy and have called for authorities to focus on providing the vaccine to health workers and the most vulnerable patients in order to conserve stocks . that 's the plan that germany 's 16 states agreed to earlier this month when health ministers said they would get enough of the vaccine for a third of the german population . " vaccine for 30 percent of the population is enough to vaccinate the 7 million people in the health sector , another seven million in the public service and risk groups such as pregnant women or children , " peter wutzler , president of the german association for the fight against viral disease , told the afp news agency . mutation still possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus could become more - or less - dangerous if it mutates the who has said it is engaged in talks with pharmaceutical companies to donate or provide the drug to developing nations at lower cost .
the organization is also requesting highly industrialized nations to donate some of their stockpiled drugs to the developing world . the swine flu outbreak , which is officially called the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus because of its ability to infect many types of animals - not just pigs - has become " unstoppable , " a who official told the dpa news agency . more than 800 deaths have been linked to the virus , and though the who no longer provides figures on the number of infected people worldwide , swine flu has spread to 160 of the organization 's 193 member states . experts warn that the virus , which has largely been treated with two existing anti-flu drugs , might mutate and become more deadly .
it remains unclear if a vaccine currently under development would be able to protect humans from a mutated form of the virus . sms / afp / dpa / ap editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by working for charitable organisations they aim to improve their social skills and change corporate culture . barbara zastrozynski works for a large insurance company in duesseldorf .
she 's an it manager in charge of a team of more than 50 employees .
as part of a training program for her company she volunteered to take part in changing sides – for a week she 's working with homeless people .
" i was very curious about the whole thing , " she says .
" as an executive you get to view people more and more simply as a resource .
so my interest was to get back to seeing people as people , rather than resources that we allocate to this or that job . "
for a week she 's been helping to hand out food and coffee in a soup kitchen and taken part in counselling sessions .
she was surrounded by people and problems she would never have encountered in her own life .
she said it was like living in a different world with men and women who have to struggle for survival on a daily basis .
" i was deeply moved by what i 've seen .
especially that day i spent with the streetworkers outside – we 've been to places i 'd never been to before , met people i never had contact with before , " she says .
strengthening corporate culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : challenges faced by the homeless make those faced by managers seem minor the idea behind changing sides comes from switzerland .
it was developed especially for to executives , with the goal of strengthening their social skills .
nine years ago , the concept was introduced in germany .
maria wrede of a volunteers organisation in cologne , is head of the local changing sides project .
" it 's very important that companies realize that they have a social responsibility .
and they can fulfil that responsibility only through their employees .
the best place to start is at the top , to provide a good example .
this will help corporate culture and strengthen ethics within the company , " wrede says .
so far , around 1,000 managers have participated in the program , the insurance company where barbara zastrozynksi works sends people on a regular basis to spend a week with the changing sides program .
mario vaupel is head of human resources at the insurance giant .
" it 's quite important for the management to see that there are other areas in life where ' managing ' is also very difficult , " he explains .
" the problems and challenges that a drug addict faces are much more difficult and they still have to get by .
we are convinced that our management can really learn something from that experience .
they see how comparatively easy their daily tasks are if viewed from a completely different perspective . "
vaupel is in charge of selecting and sending the companies managers to take part in changing sides .
the cost is 2,500 euros per person , but he 's convinced that in the end the company can profit from that investment .
his goal is that even more of the staff take part in the program so that a growing sense of social responsibility can impact on the corporate culture on a wider basis .

her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .

her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unions -pipe- 27.07.2009 german day care workers ' dispute comes to an end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new agreement would boost salaries and healthcare for about 220,000 people the six month long stand off between german public day care workers and their employers has come to an end as both sides agree to a compromise that would raise wages and provide better healthcare . employers and labor union representatives reached a compromise on monday after tense negotiations in the german city of frankfurt .
the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "
he estimates that the raises and new health plans will cost between 500 and 700 million euros a year and called it an " absolutely acceptable " result that will benefit both children and parents .
the head of the ver.di union , frank bsirske , admitted that the agreement is n't what they had hoped for , but said that they were successful in their mission to give more recognition to the profession .
bsirske called the new heath care plan , which gives the insured individuals the legal right to a risk assessment , " very important " .
the agreement also raises the starting salaries for some jobs and the current salaries and career expectations for others .
now the voting starts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disagreement led to day care workers going on strike across the country the agreement still has to be approved in a vote by union members , starting next week .
bsirske said that the compromise would be presented to the members this week before voting , which should take about two weeks .
if the agreement is approved , it will go into effect on november 1 .
bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .
however , the delegations from vka and gew , another labor union , had already agreed on the compromise , though even ilse schaad , member of the board of gew , admitted that the unions would n't have been able to get all their demands met .
the salary conflict , which has been going on since the end of january , led to day care workers across the country going on strike at the beginning of may. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "
he estimates that the raises and new health plans will cost between 500 and 700 million euros a year and called it an " absolutely acceptable " result that will benefit both children and parents .
the head of the ver.di union , frank bsirske , admitted that the agreement is n't what they had hoped for , but said that they were successful in their mission to give more recognition to the profession .
bsirske called the new heath care plan , which gives the insured individuals the legal right to a risk assessment , " very important " .

bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .

continued high temperatures around the mediterranean however , are turning forests dry and creating conditions for more fires . the worst affected countries were spain , france and italy and most of the blazes in those nations are now under control , but firefighters continue to remain on alert .
as an example , a fire that was thought to be under control near the spanish town of las hurdes flared up again due to strong winds and that forced the evacuation of more than 500 people .
the blaze burned over 500 hectares .
as temperatures remain high , spain 's interior ministry has kept the country on high alert for more wildfires .
the national weather office has issued an " orange " alert , the second highest level , for 24 provinces .
spanish officials said that roughly 24,000 hectares have been burned and six people have lost their lives over the last week .

distanced from the establishment , they are the real avant-garde of the art world .
this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . anyone who does n't know the berlin art scene well probably imagines it as being centred around small , hidden entrances leading into dilapidated buildings whose exteriors are liberally covered with graffiti .
the interior is inevitably in an equally poor condition , with pictures - selected by a young person who looks barely old enough to have completed university - hanging on crumbling walls . at least in one case , that stereotype described reality to a t - at styx gallery in berlin . michael rade is 26 years old and has been managing his own art gallery for a year . between prenzlauer berg and friedrichshein , rade 's gallery is located at the heart of the district that the berlin art scene calls home . an unlikely mixture : beer and art the styx gallery is housed in a massive building that used to be a former brewery .
naturally , it 's covered in graffiti . after opening the door with a cardboard sign reading " artists.com " on it , one is immediately hit by a damp , musty smell , no doubt caused by the small puddle of rainwater collecting near the entrance .
the next sense to be attacked is the hearing .
from an unknown corner , a radio fills the room with spanish music while hammering and knocking emanates from another part of the building . bildunterschrift : renovation would ruin the gallery 's atmosphere , says michael rade a trail of candles the words " just keep following the candlelight " echo from the other end of the gloomy corridor , followed by " the electricity is out today . "
due to this unexpected development , rade has arranged a trail of candles leading into his gallery . there , he sits in one corner of the 120-square-meter -lrb- nearly 11-square-foot -rrb- whitewashed room he ironically calls the " white cube . "
ironically - because the modern , clinically clean atmosphere that a " white cube gallery " conjures up does n't have anything to do with the poorly plastered walls and small windows in this place . london was a " tough nut to crack " a typical 26-year-old , one would think , has just finished his studies , is taking the first tentative steps towards a career , and may occasionally visit the odd art gallery .
but rade already has all of this behind him . in his quiet voice he tells how , after having completed his graphic design studies in hamburg , he was pulled towards london , one of the iconic style capitals of the world .
there he began to organize art exhibitions for friends until he realized that the london art scene " is a tough nut to crack . " then he discovered the white cube in berlin and one thing was clear : this would become his new gallery . bildunterschrift : the entrance to the " white cube " a matter of taste currently , styx is displaying the work of london-based artist emc collard , who rade knows personally from his time there .
but this is not normal practice in his gallery . typically , rade comes across artists over the internet and , if he likes their work , arranges a meeting to discuss a possible exhibition . if a deal is reached , the artist receives 50 percent of any piece sold , while the young curator keeps the other half . all artists whose work he has exhibited are also featured on his web site . " that is the least that i can do form them , " says stade . " i ca n't represent them at art conventions and i do n't yet have a portfolio . " nevertheless , some of the artists have been able to utilize styx as a springboard to more prestigious endeavors . bildunterschrift : rade keeps half of what the artwork sells for renovation awaits though he 's just gotten started , rade has already enjoyed considerable success with his small gallery . between 50 and 300 visitors attend each exhibition 's grand opening and each piece from his current display sells for anywhere between 490 and 3,300 euros . but whether styx can grow and become a major player in the berlin art scene is doubtful . the former brewery belongs to an investor who occasionally pops by to see how the young curator is doing . he currently plans to have the white cube renovated , which would mean rade would have to relocate - a prospect he 's not looking forward to . if the walls are replastered , the holes in the roof plugged , and the graffiti removed , the " great charm " of the building would be lost forever , says rade . authors : elena singer / andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . anyone who does n't know the berlin art scene well probably imagines it as being centred around small , hidden entrances leading into dilapidated buildings whose exteriors are liberally covered with graffiti .
the interior is inevitably in an equally poor condition , with pictures - selected by a young person who looks barely old enough to have completed university - hanging on crumbling walls . at least in one case , that stereotype described reality to a t - at styx gallery in berlin . michael rade is 26 years old and has been managing his own art gallery for a year . between prenzlauer berg and friedrichshein , rade 's gallery is located at the heart of the district that the berlin art scene calls home . an unlikely mixture : beer and art the styx gallery is housed in a massive building that used to be a former brewery .
naturally , it 's covered in graffiti . after opening the door with a cardboard sign reading " artists.com " on it , one is immediately hit by a damp , musty smell , no doubt caused by the small puddle of rainwater collecting near the entrance .
the next sense to be attacked is the hearing .
from an unknown corner , a radio fills the room with spanish music while hammering and knocking emanates from another part of the building . bildunterschrift : renovation would ruin the gallery 's atmosphere , says michael rade a trail of candles the words " just keep following the candlelight " echo from the other end of the gloomy corridor , followed by " the electricity is out today . "
due to this unexpected development , rade has arranged a trail of candles leading into his gallery . there , he sits in one corner of the 120-square-meter -lrb- nearly 11-square-foot -rrb- whitewashed room he ironically calls the " white cube . "
ironically - because the modern , clinically clean atmosphere that a " white cube gallery " conjures up does n't have anything to do with the poorly plastered walls and small windows in this place . london was a " tough nut to crack " a typical 26-year-old , one would think , has just finished his studies , is taking the first tentative steps towards a career , and may occasionally visit the odd art gallery .
but rade already has all of this behind him . in his quiet voice he tells how , after having completed his graphic design studies in hamburg , he was pulled towards london , one of the iconic style capitals of the world .

but this is not normal practice in his gallery . typically , rade comes across artists over the internet and , if he likes their work , arranges a meeting to discuss a possible exhibition . if a deal is reached , the artist receives 50 percent of any piece sold , while the young curator keeps the other half . all artists whose work he has exhibited are also featured on his web site .

the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "
he estimates that the raises and new health plans will cost between 500 and 700 million euros a year and called it an " absolutely acceptable " result that will benefit both children and parents .
the head of the ver.di union , frank bsirske , admitted that the agreement is n't what they had hoped for , but said that they were successful in their mission to give more recognition to the profession .
bsirske called the new heath care plan , which gives the insured individuals the legal right to a risk assessment , " very important " .
the agreement also raises the starting salaries for some jobs and the current salaries and career expectations for others .
now the voting starts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disagreement led to day care workers going on strike across the country the agreement still has to be approved in a vote by union members , starting next week .
bsirske said that the compromise would be presented to the members this week before voting , which should take about two weeks .
if the agreement is approved , it will go into effect on november 1 .
bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .
however , the delegations from vka and gew , another labor union , had already agreed on the compromise , though even ilse schaad , member of the board of gew , admitted that the unions would n't have been able to get all their demands met .
the salary conflict , which has been going on since the end of january , led to day care workers across the country going on strike at the beginning of may. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by working for charitable organisations they aim to improve their social skills and change corporate culture . barbara zastrozynski works for a large insurance company in duesseldorf .
she 's an it manager in charge of a team of more than 50 employees .
as part of a training program for her company she volunteered to take part in changing sides – for a week she 's working with homeless people .
" i was very curious about the whole thing , " she says .
" as an executive you get to view people more and more simply as a resource .
so my interest was to get back to seeing people as people , rather than resources that we allocate to this or that job . "
for a week she 's been helping to hand out food and coffee in a soup kitchen and taken part in counselling sessions .
she was surrounded by people and problems she would never have encountered in her own life .
she said it was like living in a different world with men and women who have to struggle for survival on a daily basis .
" i was deeply moved by what i 've seen .
especially that day i spent with the streetworkers outside – we 've been to places i 'd never been to before , met people i never had contact with before , " she says .
strengthening corporate culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : challenges faced by the homeless make those faced by managers seem minor the idea behind changing sides comes from switzerland .
it was developed especially for to executives , with the goal of strengthening their social skills .
nine years ago , the concept was introduced in germany .
maria wrede of a volunteers organisation in cologne , is head of the local changing sides project .
" it 's very important that companies realize that they have a social responsibility .
and they can fulfil that responsibility only through their employees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.07.2009 bulgarian parliament approves new government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borisov faces an uphill battle to curb corruption and get back in the eu 's favor bulgaria ’ s new prime minister , boiko borisov , was sworn in to office on monday , swearing to rein in systemic corruption and organized crime in hopes of convincing the eu his country should receive financial aid . three weeks following national elections in bulgaria , boiko borisov has been sworn in as the country 's new prime minister .
borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

a new era dawns at the bayreuth festival dark history still haunts bayreuth festival classical music -pipe- 27.07.2009 the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner sisters have n't changed much - but at least they 're talking to each other the 98th bayreuth festival has started its process of renewal by turning on the charm and changing its tone after a long war of attrition with the german press . " artistic stagnation " was the catchword back when wolfgang wagner , soon to turn 90 , was still festival director . in year one of the co-directorship of his daughters eva wagner-pasquier , 64 , and katharina wagner , 31 , there is little new to be seen onstage - actually , nothing , with no new productions this season .
yet change is in the air , if only in that these two wagners are n't at loggerheads with each other . considering the worldwide obsession with this most authentic of opera festivals - 133 years after it was founded , still doing what its founder richard wagner intended it to - it 's unusual that its image was defined for so long by newspaper critics . wolfgang wagner , richard wagner 's grandson , loved to engage the press in a spirit of confrontation .
in the last fifteen years of his tenure , it turned bitter and reflexive . pr plus musical excellence great-granddaughter katharina wagner is responsible for having revamped the web site -lrb- www.bayreuther-festspiele.de -rrb- , and also directs the incorporated subsidiary bayreuth medien , which handles multimedia aspects of the festival . pre-empting the press and setting the agenda herself , she has said that she has a clear sense of where the festival should position itself : at the forefront of wagner interpretation worldwide . and that will require more than public relations . hopes are placed in the management expertise of eva wagner-pasquier , in the new conductors announced in the coming seasons -lrb- andris nelsons , thomas henglebrock and kirill petrenko -rrb- , and in the prospect that today 's handful of truly exciting wagnerian singers will be heard in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is taking place this year for the 98th time repeat boos for katharina considering that katharina was once again booed for her production of " mastersingers , " it may take some time for the new artistic approach to establish itself .
apparently her new position at the helm does n't give her any bonus points with the critical bayreuth audience . but the musical rendition of " mastersingers " does n't get lost in the stage antics - and that 's saying quite a bit , considering that katharina wagner basically turns the story upside down . in " mastersingers , " there 's quite a bit of singing about singing , as the story revolves around the craft of composition for the voice .
katharina came up with a piece of stage direction about stage direction , with references to the history , not all of it savory , of stagings of the " mastersingers " since the premiere over 140 years ago .
the work was , after all , a favorite in the third reich . to be understood , this meta-level commentary requires an audience that knows the score , the words and a context of different stagings .
katharina wagner can expect that of the bayreuth audience , yet she also goes beyond that small elite group of bayreuth ticket-holders , venturing into the worlds of local public viewing and internet broadcasting worldwide . beyond the green hill public viewing , simultaneous live stream and audio-on-demand continue with a different work on aug .
9 : christoph marthaler 's four-year-old setting of " tristan and isolde , " which opened the festival on july 25 . though bayreuth was late to jump on the multimedia bandwagon , bigger and better projects are reportedly in the works on the green hill . it was announced that the wagners are planning performances of their great-grandfather 's early works in the city of bayreuth -lrb- though not in the festspielhaus -rrb- , and that the new production of the ring cycle in the richard wagner bicentennial year 2013 will be publicly viewed and broadcast on the web . bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner 's daughters are softening the tone he set author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.07.2009 german health minister defends use of government car while on vacation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt may yet regret bringing her car down to spain after the theft of her government issued mercedes in spain , ulla schmidt is on the hot seat about why the car was even there in the first place . german health minister ulla schmidt defended monday her use of a chauffeur-driven government car while on holiday in alicante , spain , as friction grew within chancellor angela merkel 's government over the matter , which came to light when the car was stolen after her driver 's hotel room was burglarized .
her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .
reiner holznagel from the taxpayers ' union , a pressure group , accused her of waffling : " mrs schmidt has gone back and forth .
" when we asked her on saturday , she said she was not using the official car for private purposes and that she had her own car on site .
in the meantime , the ministry said she was in fact using it for private purposes and was paying for it .
" the fact remains that the car had to go from berlin to alicante and that costs a lot of money , " holznagel told news channel n24 .
the timing of the growing scandal is unfortunate for the spd , which had hoped to use a quiet political week to gear up their election campaign , ahead of germany 's general election on september 27. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" strategic progress relies on undermining the insurgency through politics , " miliband said as he called for " a political strategy for dealing with the insurgency through re-integration and reconciliation . "
in miliband 's view , the afghan insurgents are " a wide but shallow coalition of convenience , " and are therefore divisible .
offering insurgents who would be willing to live under the afghan constitution a chance to lay down their arms , and a promise protect them against retribution from former comrades if they do so , miliband said , could turn the tide of the conflict .

" strategic progress relies on undermining the insurgency through politics , " miliband said as he called for " a political strategy for dealing with the insurgency through re-integration and reconciliation . "
in miliband 's view , the afghan insurgents are " a wide but shallow coalition of convenience , " and are therefore divisible .
offering insurgents who would be willing to live under the afghan constitution a chance to lay down their arms , and a promise protect them against retribution from former comrades if they do so , miliband said , could turn the tide of the conflict .
sharing the load miliband also called for greater burden-sharing among nations contributing troops to the war effort .
britain currently has 9,000 troops serving in the alliance 's military operations in afghanistan , the second-largest contingent there after the us .
but the afghan mission has come under renewed scrutiny in the uk following the deaths of 20 british soldiers in july so far , the bloodiest month for the contingent since the afghan mission began .
the german public has long been reluctant to back a more active military mission in afghanistan , but circumstances may force their commanders ' hands .
in recent weeks , taliban militants have increased their attacks on afghan and german troops in the north of the country , and the bundeswehr has been fighting back .

by working for charitable organisations they aim to improve their social skills and change corporate culture . barbara zastrozynski works for a large insurance company in duesseldorf .
she 's an it manager in charge of a team of more than 50 employees .
as part of a training program for her company she volunteered to take part in changing sides – for a week she 's working with homeless people .
" i was very curious about the whole thing , " she says .
" as an executive you get to view people more and more simply as a resource .
so my interest was to get back to seeing people as people , rather than resources that we allocate to this or that job . "
for a week she 's been helping to hand out food and coffee in a soup kitchen and taken part in counselling sessions .
she was surrounded by people and problems she would never have encountered in her own life .
she said it was like living in a different world with men and women who have to struggle for survival on a daily basis .
" i was deeply moved by what i 've seen .
especially that day i spent with the streetworkers outside – we 've been to places i 'd never been to before , met people i never had contact with before , " she says .
strengthening corporate culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : challenges faced by the homeless make those faced by managers seem minor the idea behind changing sides comes from switzerland .
it was developed especially for to executives , with the goal of strengthening their social skills .
nine years ago , the concept was introduced in germany .
maria wrede of a volunteers organisation in cologne , is head of the local changing sides project .
" it 's very important that companies realize that they have a social responsibility .
and they can fulfil that responsibility only through their employees .
the best place to start is at the top , to provide a good example .
this will help corporate culture and strengthen ethics within the company , " wrede says .
so far , around 1,000 managers have participated in the program , the insurance company where barbara zastrozynksi works sends people on a regular basis to spend a week with the changing sides program .
mario vaupel is head of human resources at the insurance giant .
" it 's quite important for the management to see that there are other areas in life where ' managing ' is also very difficult , " he explains .
" the problems and challenges that a drug addict faces are much more difficult and they still have to get by .
we are convinced that our management can really learn something from that experience .
they see how comparatively easy their daily tasks are if viewed from a completely different perspective . "
vaupel is in charge of selecting and sending the companies managers to take part in changing sides .
the cost is 2,500 euros per person , but he 's convinced that in the end the company can profit from that investment .
his goal is that even more of the staff take part in the program so that a growing sense of social responsibility can impact on the corporate culture on a wider basis .

the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "
he estimates that the raises and new health plans will cost between 500 and 700 million euros a year and called it an " absolutely acceptable " result that will benefit both children and parents .
the head of the ver.di union , frank bsirske , admitted that the agreement is n't what they had hoped for , but said that they were successful in their mission to give more recognition to the profession .
bsirske called the new heath care plan , which gives the insured individuals the legal right to a risk assessment , " very important " .
the agreement also raises the starting salaries for some jobs and the current salaries and career expectations for others .
now the voting starts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disagreement led to day care workers going on strike across the country the agreement still has to be approved in a vote by union members , starting next week .
bsirske said that the compromise would be presented to the members this week before voting , which should take about two weeks .
if the agreement is approved , it will go into effect on november 1 .
bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .
however , the delegations from vka and gew , another labor union , had already agreed on the compromise , though even ilse schaad , member of the board of gew , admitted that the unions would n't have been able to get all their demands met .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2009 iceland confident about eu membership talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skarphedinsson expects iceland to become a member within 3 years icelandic foreign minister ossur skarphedinsson says his country is in a strong position ahead of eu membership talks .
he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .

the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "
he estimates that the raises and new health plans will cost between 500 and 700 million euros a year and called it an " absolutely acceptable " result that will benefit both children and parents .
the head of the ver.di union , frank bsirske , admitted that the agreement is n't what they had hoped for , but said that they were successful in their mission to give more recognition to the profession .
bsirske called the new heath care plan , which gives the insured individuals the legal right to a risk assessment , " very important " .
the agreement also raises the starting salaries for some jobs and the current salaries and career expectations for others .
now the voting starts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disagreement led to day care workers going on strike across the country the agreement still has to be approved in a vote by union members , starting next week .
bsirske said that the compromise would be presented to the members this week before voting , which should take about two weeks .
if the agreement is approved , it will go into effect on november 1 .
bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .
however , the delegations from vka and gew , another labor union , had already agreed on the compromise , though even ilse schaad , member of the board of gew , admitted that the unions would n't have been able to get all their demands met .
the salary conflict , which has been going on since the end of january , led to day care workers across the country going on strike at the beginning of may. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .

quite a lot .

we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "
he estimates that the raises and new health plans will cost between 500 and 700 million euros a year and called it an " absolutely acceptable " result that will benefit both children and parents .
the head of the ver.di union , frank bsirske , admitted that the agreement is n't what they had hoped for , but said that they were successful in their mission to give more recognition to the profession .
bsirske called the new heath care plan , which gives the insured individuals the legal right to a risk assessment , " very important " .
the agreement also raises the starting salaries for some jobs and the current salaries and career expectations for others .
now the voting starts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disagreement led to day care workers going on strike across the country the agreement still has to be approved in a vote by union members , starting next week .
bsirske said that the compromise would be presented to the members this week before voting , which should take about two weeks .
if the agreement is approved , it will go into effect on november 1 .
bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .
however , the delegations from vka and gew , another labor union , had already agreed on the compromise , though even ilse schaad , member of the board of gew , admitted that the unions would n't have been able to get all their demands met .
the salary conflict , which has been going on since the end of january , led to day care workers across the country going on strike at the beginning of may. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the lion 's share of these limited supplies will go to wealthy countries , " who director margaret chan said last week .

health ministers agreed to buy mass vaccinations in september . france has placed a firm order for 94 million doses of vaccine doses and an option for 36 million more .
starting in october , it hopes to be able to protect each and every member of its population of 64 million .

" vaccine for 30 percent of the population is enough to vaccinate the 7 million people in the health sector , another seven million in the public service and risk groups such as pregnant women or children , " peter wutzler , president of the german association for the fight against viral disease , told the afp news agency . mutation still possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus could become more - or less - dangerous if it mutates the who has said it is engaged in talks with pharmaceutical companies to donate or provide the drug to developing nations at lower cost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2009 corporate executives in the soup kitchen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping the homeless can also help the company managers working with homeless people – that 's the idea behind the changing sides project .
by working for charitable organisations they aim to improve their social skills and change corporate culture . barbara zastrozynski works for a large insurance company in duesseldorf .
she 's an it manager in charge of a team of more than 50 employees .
as part of a training program for her company she volunteered to take part in changing sides – for a week she 's working with homeless people .
" i was very curious about the whole thing , " she says .
" as an executive you get to view people more and more simply as a resource .
so my interest was to get back to seeing people as people , rather than resources that we allocate to this or that job . "
for a week she 's been helping to hand out food and coffee in a soup kitchen and taken part in counselling sessions .
she was surrounded by people and problems she would never have encountered in her own life .
she said it was like living in a different world with men and women who have to struggle for survival on a daily basis .
" i was deeply moved by what i 've seen .
especially that day i spent with the streetworkers outside – we 've been to places i 'd never been to before , met people i never had contact with before , " she says .
strengthening corporate culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : challenges faced by the homeless make those faced by managers seem minor the idea behind changing sides comes from switzerland .
it was developed especially for to executives , with the goal of strengthening their social skills .
nine years ago , the concept was introduced in germany .
maria wrede of a volunteers organisation in cologne , is head of the local changing sides project .
" it 's very important that companies realize that they have a social responsibility .
and they can fulfil that responsibility only through their employees .
the best place to start is at the top , to provide a good example .
this will help corporate culture and strengthen ethics within the company , " wrede says .
so far , around 1,000 managers have participated in the program , the insurance company where barbara zastrozynksi works sends people on a regular basis to spend a week with the changing sides program .
mario vaupel is head of human resources at the insurance giant .
" it 's quite important for the management to see that there are other areas in life where ' managing ' is also very difficult , " he explains .
" the problems and challenges that a drug addict faces are much more difficult and they still have to get by .
we are convinced that our management can really learn something from that experience .
they see how comparatively easy their daily tasks are if viewed from a completely different perspective . "
vaupel is in charge of selecting and sending the companies managers to take part in changing sides .
the cost is 2,500 euros per person , but he 's convinced that in the end the company can profit from that investment .
his goal is that even more of the staff take part in the program so that a growing sense of social responsibility can impact on the corporate culture on a wider basis .

her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .
reiner holznagel from the taxpayers ' union , a pressure group , accused her of waffling : " mrs schmidt has gone back and forth .
" when we asked her on saturday , she said she was not using the official car for private purposes and that she had her own car on site .
in the meantime , the ministry said she was in fact using it for private purposes and was paying for it .
" the fact remains that the car had to go from berlin to alicante and that costs a lot of money , " holznagel told news channel n24 .

borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .

diplomats also reassured balkan states on iceland 's eu aspirations . although howls of protests had been raised , european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday gave the ok for further negotiations between the eu and the us on a new agreement to allow american authorities continued access to bank transfer data in terrorism investigations . the eu commission and the united states consider providing access to banking data of the swift banking transfer service essential in uncovering the financing of terror networks . swift , the society of worldwide interbank financial telecommunications , is moving its primary server and database from the united states to the netherlands .
without a new agreement , the change of location would leave american officials with access only to information on americans .
the us would then have to ask individual eu countries for access to their data . the ministers approved a mandate for the european commission , the eu 's executive , to negotiate an agreement . german and european politicians from across the political spectrum have been vociferous in their condemnation of the proposed bank data transfer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting and greeting at the brussels pow-wow " it is completely disproportionate and excessive that banking data is to be transferred even if no suspicion exists , " said juergen trittin , german green party parliamentary group leader .
" that the eu wants to allow this kind of wholesale spying is not acceptable . " but law-enforcement officials on both sides of the atlantic have supported the data access , and the eu says us oversight has been an " important and effective tool " in fighting terrorism financing and preventing attacks . " it is no question of giving the us a blank check , as some critics seem to suggest , " eu justice commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" there is no unrestricted and unverified access ; on the contrary , there are clear rules and clear limits . " if the lisbon treaty comes into force in 2010 , as the eu hopes , the european parliament will have to approve any information sharing deals .
but the treaty would not come into effect until the end of the year at the earliest , leaving a gap of several months with the swift servers in europe .
during that time the us would have no access . that would be " extremely dangerous , " according to barrot , who said a temporary agreement lasting just a few months is needed .
if and when the lisbon treaty comes into force , a new deal will have to be drawn up and approved by the eu parliament . easing fears on iceland eu ministers also sought to reassure balkan countries eager to the join the bloc that iceland would not get special treatment and would undergo the same membership tests as them . while iceland has traditionally been uninterested in eu membership , the north atlantic island nation has seen its economy devastated by the global financial crisis and many there feel eu membership would boost its financial stability . bildunterschrift : iceland already fulfills many requirements for eu membership while eu accession negotiations generally take years , iceland 's eu path is expected to be shorter and smoother than most because of its long democratic tradition and existing treaties and agreements it already has with the eu .
iceland is a member of the european free trade association and the european economic area trading groups . however , on monday , the eu 's current president , sweden , said iceland can not expect fast-track entry . " there is no fast-track for iceland but rather a shorter track because they are already a part of the single market and the schengen area , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt told reporters ahead of monday 's meeting . bildt said iceland 's eu ambitions should not overshadow those of the balkan states . " we need to focus on the western balkans , " he said , referring to the former yugoslav countries and albania .
only one of those , slovenia , is currently an eu member . " there is a need for momentum on european integration in the balkans , " he said . british foreign secretary david miliband agreed : " there is no chance of the balkans being forgotten , " he said .
" it is not about one country being privileged over another , it is about all countries being treated equally and fairly . " global hot spots the around 200 unarmed eu ceasefire monitors in georgia posted there since the country 's war with its russia-backed breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia last year will stay until at least september 2010 , the foreign ministers agreed . " the mission 's presence on the ground remains a key stabilizing factor , " read a joint statement approved at the brussels meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu observers have been on the ground in georgia since last august 's conflict with russia the eu mission is the only international mission on the ground in georgia now , since russia vetoed the extension of un and osce observer missions that had been there previously . the eu " noted with deep regret and concern that agreement has not been reached on the future of the un and osce monitoring missions in georgia .
this development further underscores the crucial role of eumm georgia , " the statement said , referring to the eu monitoring mission . keeping in line with a united nations resolution , the eu adopted reinforced sanctions against north korea over its nuclear and weapons tests . the ministers passed without discussion a move to enforce un security council resolution 1874 " in a robust way as requested " by eu leaders at a summit last month , a statement said . the eu decided , in addition to un sanctions , on the " autonomous listing of items subject to export ban , autonomous listing of persons and entities subject to travel ban and asset freeze , enhanced financial vigilance and reinforced cargo inspections . " north korea quit six-party talks aimed at ending its nuclear weapons program after the security council censured it for a long-range rocket launch in april .

borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

" strategic progress relies on undermining the insurgency through politics , " miliband said as he called for " a political strategy for dealing with the insurgency through re-integration and reconciliation . "
in miliband 's view , the afghan insurgents are " a wide but shallow coalition of convenience , " and are therefore divisible .
offering insurgents who would be willing to live under the afghan constitution a chance to lay down their arms , and a promise protect them against retribution from former comrades if they do so , miliband said , could turn the tide of the conflict .

diplomats also reassured balkan states on iceland 's eu aspirations . although howls of protests had been raised , european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday gave the ok for further negotiations between the eu and the us on a new agreement to allow american authorities continued access to bank transfer data in terrorism investigations . the eu commission and the united states consider providing access to banking data of the swift banking transfer service essential in uncovering the financing of terror networks . swift , the society of worldwide interbank financial telecommunications , is moving its primary server and database from the united states to the netherlands .
without a new agreement , the change of location would leave american officials with access only to information on americans .
the us would then have to ask individual eu countries for access to their data . the ministers approved a mandate for the european commission , the eu 's executive , to negotiate an agreement . german and european politicians from across the political spectrum have been vociferous in their condemnation of the proposed bank data transfer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting and greeting at the brussels pow-wow " it is completely disproportionate and excessive that banking data is to be transferred even if no suspicion exists , " said juergen trittin , german green party parliamentary group leader .
" that the eu wants to allow this kind of wholesale spying is not acceptable . " but law-enforcement officials on both sides of the atlantic have supported the data access , and the eu says us oversight has been an " important and effective tool " in fighting terrorism financing and preventing attacks . " it is no question of giving the us a blank check , as some critics seem to suggest , " eu justice commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" there is no unrestricted and unverified access ; on the contrary , there are clear rules and clear limits . " if the lisbon treaty comes into force in 2010 , as the eu hopes , the european parliament will have to approve any information sharing deals .
but the treaty would not come into effect until the end of the year at the earliest , leaving a gap of several months with the swift servers in europe .
during that time the us would have no access . that would be " extremely dangerous , " according to barrot , who said a temporary agreement lasting just a few months is needed .
if and when the lisbon treaty comes into force , a new deal will have to be drawn up and approved by the eu parliament . easing fears on iceland eu ministers also sought to reassure balkan countries eager to the join the bloc that iceland would not get special treatment and would undergo the same membership tests as them . while iceland has traditionally been uninterested in eu membership , the north atlantic island nation has seen its economy devastated by the global financial crisis and many there feel eu membership would boost its financial stability . bildunterschrift : iceland already fulfills many requirements for eu membership while eu accession negotiations generally take years , iceland 's eu path is expected to be shorter and smoother than most because of its long democratic tradition and existing treaties and agreements it already has with the eu .
iceland is a member of the european free trade association and the european economic area trading groups . however , on monday , the eu 's current president , sweden , said iceland can not expect fast-track entry . " there is no fast-track for iceland but rather a shorter track because they are already a part of the single market and the schengen area , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt told reporters ahead of monday 's meeting . bildt said iceland 's eu ambitions should not overshadow those of the balkan states . " we need to focus on the western balkans , " he said , referring to the former yugoslav countries and albania .
only one of those , slovenia , is currently an eu member . " there is a need for momentum on european integration in the balkans , " he said . british foreign secretary david miliband agreed : " there is no chance of the balkans being forgotten , " he said .
" it is not about one country being privileged over another , it is about all countries being treated equally and fairly . " global hot spots the around 200 unarmed eu ceasefire monitors in georgia posted there since the country 's war with its russia-backed breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia last year will stay until at least september 2010 , the foreign ministers agreed . " the mission 's presence on the ground remains a key stabilizing factor , " read a joint statement approved at the brussels meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu observers have been on the ground in georgia since last august 's conflict with russia the eu mission is the only international mission on the ground in georgia now , since russia vetoed the extension of un and osce observer missions that had been there previously . the eu " noted with deep regret and concern that agreement has not been reached on the future of the un and osce monitoring missions in georgia .
this development further underscores the crucial role of eumm georgia , " the statement said , referring to the eu monitoring mission . keeping in line with a united nations resolution , the eu adopted reinforced sanctions against north korea over its nuclear and weapons tests . the ministers passed without discussion a move to enforce un security council resolution 1874 " in a robust way as requested " by eu leaders at a summit last month , a statement said . the eu decided , in addition to un sanctions , on the " autonomous listing of items subject to export ban , autonomous listing of persons and entities subject to travel ban and asset freeze , enhanced financial vigilance and reinforced cargo inspections . " north korea quit six-party talks aimed at ending its nuclear weapons program after the security council censured it for a long-range rocket launch in april .

" strategic progress relies on undermining the insurgency through politics , " miliband said as he called for " a political strategy for dealing with the insurgency through re-integration and reconciliation . "
in miliband 's view , the afghan insurgents are " a wide but shallow coalition of convenience , " and are therefore divisible .
offering insurgents who would be willing to live under the afghan constitution a chance to lay down their arms , and a promise protect them against retribution from former comrades if they do so , miliband said , could turn the tide of the conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2009 corporate executives in the soup kitchen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping the homeless can also help the company managers working with homeless people – that 's the idea behind the changing sides project .
by working for charitable organisations they aim to improve their social skills and change corporate culture . barbara zastrozynski works for a large insurance company in duesseldorf .
she 's an it manager in charge of a team of more than 50 employees .
as part of a training program for her company she volunteered to take part in changing sides – for a week she 's working with homeless people .
" i was very curious about the whole thing , " she says .
" as an executive you get to view people more and more simply as a resource .
so my interest was to get back to seeing people as people , rather than resources that we allocate to this or that job . "
for a week she 's been helping to hand out food and coffee in a soup kitchen and taken part in counselling sessions .
she was surrounded by people and problems she would never have encountered in her own life .
she said it was like living in a different world with men and women who have to struggle for survival on a daily basis .
" i was deeply moved by what i 've seen .
especially that day i spent with the streetworkers outside – we 've been to places i 'd never been to before , met people i never had contact with before , " she says .
strengthening corporate culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : challenges faced by the homeless make those faced by managers seem minor the idea behind changing sides comes from switzerland .
it was developed especially for to executives , with the goal of strengthening their social skills .
nine years ago , the concept was introduced in germany .
maria wrede of a volunteers organisation in cologne , is head of the local changing sides project .
" it 's very important that companies realize that they have a social responsibility .
and they can fulfil that responsibility only through their employees .
the best place to start is at the top , to provide a good example .
this will help corporate culture and strengthen ethics within the company , " wrede says .
so far , around 1,000 managers have participated in the program , the insurance company where barbara zastrozynksi works sends people on a regular basis to spend a week with the changing sides program .
mario vaupel is head of human resources at the insurance giant .
" it 's quite important for the management to see that there are other areas in life where ' managing ' is also very difficult , " he explains .
" the problems and challenges that a drug addict faces are much more difficult and they still have to get by .

a new era dawns at the bayreuth festival dark history still haunts bayreuth festival classical music -pipe- 27.07.2009 the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner sisters have n't changed much - but at least they 're talking to each other the 98th bayreuth festival has started its process of renewal by turning on the charm and changing its tone after a long war of attrition with the german press . " artistic stagnation " was the catchword back when wolfgang wagner , soon to turn 90 , was still festival director . in year one of the co-directorship of his daughters eva wagner-pasquier , 64 , and katharina wagner , 31 , there is little new to be seen onstage - actually , nothing , with no new productions this season .
yet change is in the air , if only in that these two wagners are n't at loggerheads with each other . considering the worldwide obsession with this most authentic of opera festivals - 133 years after it was founded , still doing what its founder richard wagner intended it to - it 's unusual that its image was defined for so long by newspaper critics . wolfgang wagner , richard wagner 's grandson , loved to engage the press in a spirit of confrontation .
in the last fifteen years of his tenure , it turned bitter and reflexive . pr plus musical excellence great-granddaughter katharina wagner is responsible for having revamped the web site -lrb- www.bayreuther-festspiele.de -rrb- , and also directs the incorporated subsidiary bayreuth medien , which handles multimedia aspects of the festival . pre-empting the press and setting the agenda herself , she has said that she has a clear sense of where the festival should position itself : at the forefront of wagner interpretation worldwide . and that will require more than public relations . hopes are placed in the management expertise of eva wagner-pasquier , in the new conductors announced in the coming seasons -lrb- andris nelsons , thomas henglebrock and kirill petrenko -rrb- , and in the prospect that today 's handful of truly exciting wagnerian singers will be heard in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is taking place this year for the 98th time repeat boos for katharina considering that katharina was once again booed for her production of " mastersingers , " it may take some time for the new artistic approach to establish itself .
apparently her new position at the helm does n't give her any bonus points with the critical bayreuth audience . but the musical rendition of " mastersingers " does n't get lost in the stage antics - and that 's saying quite a bit , considering that katharina wagner basically turns the story upside down . in " mastersingers , " there 's quite a bit of singing about singing , as the story revolves around the craft of composition for the voice .
katharina came up with a piece of stage direction about stage direction , with references to the history , not all of it savory , of stagings of the " mastersingers " since the premiere over 140 years ago .
the work was , after all , a favorite in the third reich . to be understood , this meta-level commentary requires an audience that knows the score , the words and a context of different stagings .
katharina wagner can expect that of the bayreuth audience , yet she also goes beyond that small elite group of bayreuth ticket-holders , venturing into the worlds of local public viewing and internet broadcasting worldwide . beyond the green hill public viewing , simultaneous live stream and audio-on-demand continue with a different work on aug .
9 : christoph marthaler 's four-year-old setting of " tristan and isolde , " which opened the festival on july 25 . though bayreuth was late to jump on the multimedia bandwagon , bigger and better projects are reportedly in the works on the green hill . it was announced that the wagners are planning performances of their great-grandfather 's early works in the city of bayreuth -lrb- though not in the festspielhaus -rrb- , and that the new production of the ring cycle in the richard wagner bicentennial year 2013 will be publicly viewed and broadcast on the web . bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner 's daughters are softening the tone he set author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de wagner festival gets a revamp , but is it only skin deep ?

a new era dawns at the bayreuth festival dark history still haunts bayreuth festival classical -pipe- 27.07.2009 the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner sisters have n't changed much - but at least they 're talking to each other the 98th bayreuth festival has started its process of renewal by turning on the charm and changing its tone after a long war of attrition with the german press . " artistic stagnation " was the catchword back when wolfgang wagner , soon to turn 90 , was still festival director . in year one of the co-directorship of his daughters eva wagner-pasquier , 64 , and katharina wagner , 31 , there is little new to be seen onstage - actually , nothing , with no new productions this season .
yet change is in the air , if only in that these two wagners are n't at loggerheads with each other . considering the worldwide obsession with this most authentic of opera festivals - 133 years after it was founded , still doing what its founder richard wagner intended it to - it 's unusual that its image was defined for so long by newspaper critics . wolfgang wagner , richard wagner 's grandson , loved to engage the press in a spirit of confrontation .
in the last fifteen years of his tenure , it turned bitter and reflexive . pr plus musical excellence great-granddaughter katharina wagner is responsible for having revamped the web site -lrb- www.bayreuther-festspiele.de -rrb- , and also directs the incorporated subsidiary bayreuth medien , which handles multimedia aspects of the festival . pre-empting the press and setting the agenda herself , she has said that she has a clear sense of where the festival should position itself : at the forefront of wagner interpretation worldwide . and that will require more than public relations . hopes are placed in the management expertise of eva wagner-pasquier , in the new conductors announced in the coming seasons -lrb- andris nelsons , thomas henglebrock and kirill petrenko -rrb- , and in the prospect that today 's handful of truly exciting wagnerian singers will be heard in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is taking place this year for the 98th time repeat boos for katharina considering that katharina was once again booed for her production of " mastersingers , " it may take some time for the new artistic approach to establish itself .
apparently her new position at the helm does n't give her any bonus points with the critical bayreuth audience . but the musical rendition of " mastersingers " does n't get lost in the stage antics - and that 's saying quite a bit , considering that katharina wagner basically turns the story upside down . in " mastersingers , " there 's quite a bit of singing about singing , as the story revolves around the craft of composition for the voice .
katharina came up with a piece of stage direction about stage direction , with references to the history , not all of it savory , of stagings of the " mastersingers " since the premiere over 140 years ago .
the work was , after all , a favorite in the third reich . to be understood , this meta-level commentary requires an audience that knows the score , the words and a context of different stagings .
katharina wagner can expect that of the bayreuth audience , yet she also goes beyond that small elite group of bayreuth ticket-holders , venturing into the worlds of local public viewing and internet broadcasting worldwide . beyond the green hill public viewing , simultaneous live stream and audio-on-demand continue with a different work on aug .
9 : christoph marthaler 's four-year-old setting of " tristan and isolde , " which opened the festival on july 25 . though bayreuth was late to jump on the multimedia bandwagon , bigger and better projects are reportedly in the works on the green hill . it was announced that the wagners are planning performances of their great-grandfather 's early works in the city of bayreuth -lrb- though not in the festspielhaus -rrb- , and that the new production of the ring cycle in the richard wagner bicentennial year 2013 will be publicly viewed and broadcast on the web . bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner 's daughters are softening the tone he set author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .
reiner holznagel from the taxpayers ' union , a pressure group , accused her of waffling : " mrs schmidt has gone back and forth .
" when we asked her on saturday , she said she was not using the official car for private purposes and that she had her own car on site .
in the meantime , the ministry said she was in fact using it for private purposes and was paying for it .
" the fact remains that the car had to go from berlin to alicante and that costs a lot of money , " holznagel told news channel n24 .

the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .
reiner holznagel from the taxpayers ' union , a pressure group , accused her of waffling : " mrs schmidt has gone back and forth .
" when we asked her on saturday , she said she was not using the official car for private purposes and that she had her own car on site .
in the meantime , the ministry said she was in fact using it for private purposes and was paying for it .
" the fact remains that the car had to go from berlin to alicante and that costs a lot of money , " holznagel told news channel n24 .
the timing of the growing scandal is unfortunate for the spd , which had hoped to use a quiet political week to gear up their election campaign , ahead of germany 's general election on september 27. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.07.2009 bulgarian parliament approves new government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borisov faces an uphill battle to curb corruption and get back in the eu 's favor bulgaria ’ s new prime minister , boiko borisov , was sworn in to office on monday , swearing to rein in systemic corruption and organized crime in hopes of convincing the eu his country should receive financial aid . three weeks following national elections in bulgaria , boiko borisov has been sworn in as the country 's new prime minister .
borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2009 iceland confident about eu membership talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skarphedinsson expects iceland to become a member within 3 years icelandic foreign minister ossur skarphedinsson says his country is in a strong position ahead of eu membership talks .
he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

the ship and its 220-strong crew is heading for the horn of africa to take part in the european union 's atalanta mission to tackle piracy in some of the world 's most dangerous waters .
on august 11 , after arriving at the naval station at djibouti , the bremen is to take over the duties of the frigate rheinland-pfalz , which has , along with another frigate , the brandenburg , been representing germany 's navy in the eu-wide mission .
the bremen is to be primarily assigned to protect ships making runs to somalia for the united nations ' world food program , but it is also to help keep shipping lanes open for other ships as needed . problems remain over the past two years , pirates along somalia 's 3,100-kilometer coast have hijacked dozens of ships for ransom payments worth millions of dollars .
eu foreign ministers decided last month to extend the mission , which involves 14 ships , by a year , until the end of 2010 .
there are around 500 german military personnel involved in the mission .
since the operation began in december , eu-flagged vessels have detained more than 50 suspected pirates , whom they have handed over to the kenyan authorities in line with a deal reached in march. mrh / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .

low inflation leads to increased spending and despite the ongoing recession , most people seem to expect the crisis to be over soon . consumers have pinned their hopes on an early end to the crisis .
a closely watched study on consumer confidence suggests that a combination of economic optimism and record-low inflation has german consumer confidence surging in august .
the forward-looking gfk index , which was released on monday , rose to an estimated 3.5 points for august from 3.0 in july .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending their money , rather than saving it " after some economic institutes signalled an end to the economic downturn , the economic pessimism on the part of the consumers has also declined .
inflation is disappearing and people have more money in their pockets , " says the report .
inflation in germany had hit a record of zero percent in may , in june inflation stood at 0.1 percent .
analysts even predict falling prices for the coming summer months - a phenomenon not seen for more than 20 years .
at the same time , interest rates offered by banks are lower than they have been for years so that there 's little incentive for people to keep their money in the bank .
stable prices have managed to trigger consumer spending - especially on larger purchases like household appliances and home entertainment .
the government 's program in which it pays cash to people who scrap their old cars for new models has lead to a surge in automobile purchases .
rising unemployment threatens to reverse confidence another reason for the upbeat view of the country 's economic prospects is the fact that unemployment has not yet risen to the extent many had feared it would .
experts however warn of a sharp rise in unemployment in the months to come as soon as the global recession starts to catch up with germany 's labour market .
the assumption that the steep economic downturn has come to an end could therefore be premature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising unemployment in the autumn could dampen the optimism " the acid test for the consumer climate still lies ahead .
a long-lasting stabilisation of the consumer climate will depend on how the labor market develops in the future .
if the unemployment figures climb high in late autumn , this will be a test for consumer confidence , " the report says , adding that based on a long-term comparison , the consumer climate index is still at a very low level .
the gfk report comes only days after a report that german business confidence improved for the fourth consecutive month in july . on friday , the business climate index released by the institute for economic research -lrb- ifo -rrb- exceeded economists ' expectations by rising to 87.3 points after reaching a seven-month high in june of 85.9. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

low inflation leads to increased spending and despite the ongoing recession , most people seem to expect the crisis to be over soon . consumers have pinned their hopes on an early end to the crisis .
a closely watched study on consumer confidence suggests that a combination of economic optimism and record-low inflation has german consumer confidence surging in august .
the forward-looking gfk index , which was released on monday , rose to an estimated 3.5 points for august from 3.0 in july .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending their money , rather than saving it " after some economic institutes signalled an end to the economic downturn , the economic pessimism on the part of the consumers has also declined .
inflation is disappearing and people have more money in their pockets , " says the report .
inflation in germany had hit a record of zero percent in may , in june inflation stood at 0.1 percent .
analysts even predict falling prices for the coming summer months - a phenomenon not seen for more than 20 years .
at the same time , interest rates offered by banks are lower than they have been for years so that there 's little incentive for people to keep their money in the bank .
stable prices have managed to trigger consumer spending - especially on larger purchases like household appliances and home entertainment .
the government 's program in which it pays cash to people who scrap their old cars for new models has lead to a surge in automobile purchases .
rising unemployment threatens to reverse confidence another reason for the upbeat view of the country 's economic prospects is the fact that unemployment has not yet risen to the extent many had feared it would .
experts however warn of a sharp rise in unemployment in the months to come as soon as the global recession starts to catch up with germany 's labour market .
the assumption that the steep economic downturn has come to an end could therefore be premature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising unemployment in the autumn could dampen the optimism " the acid test for the consumer climate still lies ahead .
a long-lasting stabilisation of the consumer climate will depend on how the labor market develops in the future .
if the unemployment figures climb high in late autumn , this will be a test for consumer confidence , " the report says , adding that based on a long-term comparison , the consumer climate index is still at a very low level .
the gfk report comes only days after a report that german business confidence improved for the fourth consecutive month in july . on friday , the business climate index released by the institute for economic research -lrb- ifo -rrb- exceeded economists ' expectations by rising to 87.3 points after reaching a seven-month high in june of 85.9. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" strategic progress relies on undermining the insurgency through politics , " miliband said as he called for " a political strategy for dealing with the insurgency through re-integration and reconciliation . "
in miliband 's view , the afghan insurgents are " a wide but shallow coalition of convenience , " and are therefore divisible .
offering insurgents who would be willing to live under the afghan constitution a chance to lay down their arms , and a promise protect them against retribution from former comrades if they do so , miliband said , could turn the tide of the conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : a new era in bayreuth wagner festival gets a revamp , but is it only skin deep ?
a new era dawns at the bayreuth festival dark history still haunts bayreuth festival classical music -pipe- 27.07.2009 the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner sisters have n't changed much - but at least they 're talking to each other the 98th bayreuth festival has started its process of renewal by turning on the charm and changing its tone after a long war of attrition with the german press . " artistic stagnation " was the catchword back when wolfgang wagner , soon to turn 90 , was still festival director . in year one of the co-directorship of his daughters eva wagner-pasquier , 64 , and katharina wagner , 31 , there is little new to be seen onstage - actually , nothing , with no new productions this season .
yet change is in the air , if only in that these two wagners are n't at loggerheads with each other . considering the worldwide obsession with this most authentic of opera festivals - 133 years after it was founded , still doing what its founder richard wagner intended it to - it 's unusual that its image was defined for so long by newspaper critics . wolfgang wagner , richard wagner 's grandson , loved to engage the press in a spirit of confrontation .
in the last fifteen years of his tenure , it turned bitter and reflexive . pr plus musical excellence great-granddaughter katharina wagner is responsible for having revamped the web site -lrb- www.bayreuther-festspiele.de -rrb- , and also directs the incorporated subsidiary bayreuth medien , which handles multimedia aspects of the festival . pre-empting the press and setting the agenda herself , she has said that she has a clear sense of where the festival should position itself : at the forefront of wagner interpretation worldwide . and that will require more than public relations . hopes are placed in the management expertise of eva wagner-pasquier , in the new conductors announced in the coming seasons -lrb- andris nelsons , thomas henglebrock and kirill petrenko -rrb- , and in the prospect that today 's handful of truly exciting wagnerian singers will be heard in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is taking place this year for the 98th time repeat boos for katharina considering that katharina was once again booed for her production of " mastersingers , " it may take some time for the new artistic approach to establish itself .
apparently her new position at the helm does n't give her any bonus points with the critical bayreuth audience . but the musical rendition of " mastersingers " does n't get lost in the stage antics - and that 's saying quite a bit , considering that katharina wagner basically turns the story upside down . in " mastersingers , " there 's quite a bit of singing about singing , as the story revolves around the craft of composition for the voice .
katharina came up with a piece of stage direction about stage direction , with references to the history , not all of it savory , of stagings of the " mastersingers " since the premiere over 140 years ago .
the work was , after all , a favorite in the third reich . to be understood , this meta-level commentary requires an audience that knows the score , the words and a context of different stagings .
katharina wagner can expect that of the bayreuth audience , yet she also goes beyond that small elite group of bayreuth ticket-holders , venturing into the worlds of local public viewing and internet broadcasting worldwide . beyond the green hill public viewing , simultaneous live stream and audio-on-demand continue with a different work on aug .
9 : christoph marthaler 's four-year-old setting of " tristan and isolde , " which opened the festival on july 25 . though bayreuth was late to jump on the multimedia bandwagon , bigger and better projects are reportedly in the works on the green hill . it was announced that the wagners are planning performances of their great-grandfather 's early works in the city of bayreuth -lrb- though not in the festspielhaus -rrb- , and that the new production of the ring cycle in the richard wagner bicentennial year 2013 will be publicly viewed and broadcast on the web . bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner 's daughters are softening the tone he set author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new era dawns at the bayreuth festival dark history still haunts bayreuth festival classical -pipe- 27.07.2009 the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner sisters have n't changed much - but at least they 're talking to each other the 98th bayreuth festival has started its process of renewal by turning on the charm and changing its tone after a long war of attrition with the german press . " artistic stagnation " was the catchword back when wolfgang wagner , soon to turn 90 , was still festival director . in year one of the co-directorship of his daughters eva wagner-pasquier , 64 , and katharina wagner , 31 , there is little new to be seen onstage - actually , nothing , with no new productions this season .
yet change is in the air , if only in that these two wagners are n't at loggerheads with each other . considering the worldwide obsession with this most authentic of opera festivals - 133 years after it was founded , still doing what its founder richard wagner intended it to - it 's unusual that its image was defined for so long by newspaper critics . wolfgang wagner , richard wagner 's grandson , loved to engage the press in a spirit of confrontation .
in the last fifteen years of his tenure , it turned bitter and reflexive . pr plus musical excellence great-granddaughter katharina wagner is responsible for having revamped the web site -lrb- www.bayreuther-festspiele.de -rrb- , and also directs the incorporated subsidiary bayreuth medien , which handles multimedia aspects of the festival . pre-empting the press and setting the agenda herself , she has said that she has a clear sense of where the festival should position itself : at the forefront of wagner interpretation worldwide . and that will require more than public relations . hopes are placed in the management expertise of eva wagner-pasquier , in the new conductors announced in the coming seasons -lrb- andris nelsons , thomas henglebrock and kirill petrenko -rrb- , and in the prospect that today 's handful of truly exciting wagnerian singers will be heard in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is taking place this year for the 98th time repeat boos for katharina considering that katharina was once again booed for her production of " mastersingers , " it may take some time for the new artistic approach to establish itself .
apparently her new position at the helm does n't give her any bonus points with the critical bayreuth audience . but the musical rendition of " mastersingers " does n't get lost in the stage antics - and that 's saying quite a bit , considering that katharina wagner basically turns the story upside down . in " mastersingers , " there 's quite a bit of singing about singing , as the story revolves around the craft of composition for the voice .
katharina came up with a piece of stage direction about stage direction , with references to the history , not all of it savory , of stagings of the " mastersingers " since the premiere over 140 years ago .
the work was , after all , a favorite in the third reich . to be understood , this meta-level commentary requires an audience that knows the score , the words and a context of different stagings .
katharina wagner can expect that of the bayreuth audience , yet she also goes beyond that small elite group of bayreuth ticket-holders , venturing into the worlds of local public viewing and internet broadcasting worldwide . beyond the green hill public viewing , simultaneous live stream and audio-on-demand continue with a different work on aug .
9 : christoph marthaler 's four-year-old setting of " tristan and isolde , " which opened the festival on july 25 . though bayreuth was late to jump on the multimedia bandwagon , bigger and better projects are reportedly in the works on the green hill . it was announced that the wagners are planning performances of their great-grandfather 's early works in the city of bayreuth -lrb- though not in the festspielhaus -rrb- , and that the new production of the ring cycle in the richard wagner bicentennial year 2013 will be publicly viewed and broadcast on the web . bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner 's daughters are softening the tone he set author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

continued high temperatures around the mediterranean however , are turning forests dry and creating conditions for more fires . the worst affected countries were spain , france and italy and most of the blazes in those nations are now under control , but firefighters continue to remain on alert .
as an example , a fire that was thought to be under control near the spanish town of las hurdes flared up again due to strong winds and that forced the evacuation of more than 500 people .

borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .

smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .

borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .

" the lion 's share of these limited supplies will go to wealthy countries , " who director margaret chan said last week .

health ministers agreed to buy mass vaccinations in september . france has placed a firm order for 94 million doses of vaccine doses and an option for 36 million more .
starting in october , it hopes to be able to protect each and every member of its population of 64 million .

" vaccine for 30 percent of the population is enough to vaccinate the 7 million people in the health sector , another seven million in the public service and risk groups such as pregnant women or children , " peter wutzler , president of the german association for the fight against viral disease , told the afp news agency . mutation still possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus could become more - or less - dangerous if it mutates the who has said it is engaged in talks with pharmaceutical companies to donate or provide the drug to developing nations at lower cost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unions -pipe- 27.07.2009 german day care workers ' dispute comes to an end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new agreement would boost salaries and healthcare for about 220,000 people the six month long stand off between german public day care workers and their employers has come to an end as both sides agree to a compromise that would raise wages and provide better healthcare . employers and labor union representatives reached a compromise on monday after tense negotiations in the german city of frankfurt .
the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "
he estimates that the raises and new health plans will cost between 500 and 700 million euros a year and called it an " absolutely acceptable " result that will benefit both children and parents .
the head of the ver.di union , frank bsirske , admitted that the agreement is n't what they had hoped for , but said that they were successful in their mission to give more recognition to the profession .
bsirske called the new heath care plan , which gives the insured individuals the legal right to a risk assessment , " very important " .
the agreement also raises the starting salaries for some jobs and the current salaries and career expectations for others .
now the voting starts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disagreement led to day care workers going on strike across the country the agreement still has to be approved in a vote by union members , starting next week .
bsirske said that the compromise would be presented to the members this week before voting , which should take about two weeks .
if the agreement is approved , it will go into effect on november 1 .
bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .
however , the delegations from vka and gew , another labor union , had already agreed on the compromise , though even ilse schaad , member of the board of gew , admitted that the unions would n't have been able to get all their demands met .
the salary conflict , which has been going on since the end of january , led to day care workers across the country going on strike at the beginning of may. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "
he estimates that the raises and new health plans will cost between 500 and 700 million euros a year and called it an " absolutely acceptable " result that will benefit both children and parents .

if the agreement is approved , it will go into effect on november 1 .
bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .
however , the delegations from vka and gew , another labor union , had already agreed on the compromise , though even ilse schaad , member of the board of gew , admitted that the unions would n't have been able to get all their demands met .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.07.2009 german health minister defends use of government car while on vacation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt may yet regret bringing her car down to spain after the theft of her government issued mercedes in spain , ulla schmidt is on the hot seat about why the car was even there in the first place . german health minister ulla schmidt defended monday her use of a chauffeur-driven government car while on holiday in alicante , spain , as friction grew within chancellor angela merkel 's government over the matter , which came to light when the car was stolen after her driver 's hotel room was burglarized .
her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .

her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .

" strategic progress relies on undermining the insurgency through politics , " miliband said as he called for " a political strategy for dealing with the insurgency through re-integration and reconciliation . "
in miliband 's view , the afghan insurgents are " a wide but shallow coalition of convenience , " and are therefore divisible .
offering insurgents who would be willing to live under the afghan constitution a chance to lay down their arms , and a promise protect them against retribution from former comrades if they do so , miliband said , could turn the tide of the conflict .
sharing the load miliband also called for greater burden-sharing among nations contributing troops to the war effort .
britain currently has 9,000 troops serving in the alliance 's military operations in afghanistan , the second-largest contingent there after the us .
but the afghan mission has come under renewed scrutiny in the uk following the deaths of 20 british soldiers in july so far , the bloodiest month for the contingent since the afghan mission began .
the german public has long been reluctant to back a more active military mission in afghanistan , but circumstances may force their commanders ' hands .
in recent weeks , taliban militants have increased their attacks on afghan and german troops in the north of the country , and the bundeswehr has been fighting back .

her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .
reiner holznagel from the taxpayers ' union , a pressure group , accused her of waffling : " mrs schmidt has gone back and forth .
" when we asked her on saturday , she said she was not using the official car for private purposes and that she had her own car on site .
in the meantime , the ministry said she was in fact using it for private purposes and was paying for it .
" the fact remains that the car had to go from berlin to alicante and that costs a lot of money , " holznagel told news channel n24 .
the timing of the growing scandal is unfortunate for the spd , which had hoped to use a quiet political week to gear up their election campaign , ahead of germany 's general election on september 27. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : a new era in bayreuth wagner festival gets a revamp , but is it only skin deep ?
a new era dawns at the bayreuth festival dark history still haunts bayreuth festival classical -pipe- 27.07.2009 the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner sisters have n't changed much - but at least they 're talking to each other the 98th bayreuth festival has started its process of renewal by turning on the charm and changing its tone after a long war of attrition with the german press . " artistic stagnation " was the catchword back when wolfgang wagner , soon to turn 90 , was still festival director . in year one of the co-directorship of his daughters eva wagner-pasquier , 64 , and katharina wagner , 31 , there is little new to be seen onstage - actually , nothing , with no new productions this season .
yet change is in the air , if only in that these two wagners are n't at loggerheads with each other . considering the worldwide obsession with this most authentic of opera festivals - 133 years after it was founded , still doing what its founder richard wagner intended it to - it 's unusual that its image was defined for so long by newspaper critics . wolfgang wagner , richard wagner 's grandson , loved to engage the press in a spirit of confrontation .
in the last fifteen years of his tenure , it turned bitter and reflexive . pr plus musical excellence great-granddaughter katharina wagner is responsible for having revamped the web site -lrb- www.bayreuther-festspiele.de -rrb- , and also directs the incorporated subsidiary bayreuth medien , which handles multimedia aspects of the festival . pre-empting the press and setting the agenda herself , she has said that she has a clear sense of where the festival should position itself : at the forefront of wagner interpretation worldwide . and that will require more than public relations . hopes are placed in the management expertise of eva wagner-pasquier , in the new conductors announced in the coming seasons -lrb- andris nelsons , thomas henglebrock and kirill petrenko -rrb- , and in the prospect that today 's handful of truly exciting wagnerian singers will be heard in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is taking place this year for the 98th time repeat boos for katharina considering that katharina was once again booed for her production of " mastersingers , " it may take some time for the new artistic approach to establish itself .
apparently her new position at the helm does n't give her any bonus points with the critical bayreuth audience . but the musical rendition of " mastersingers " does n't get lost in the stage antics - and that 's saying quite a bit , considering that katharina wagner basically turns the story upside down . in " mastersingers , " there 's quite a bit of singing about singing , as the story revolves around the craft of composition for the voice .
katharina came up with a piece of stage direction about stage direction , with references to the history , not all of it savory , of stagings of the " mastersingers " since the premiere over 140 years ago .
the work was , after all , a favorite in the third reich . to be understood , this meta-level commentary requires an audience that knows the score , the words and a context of different stagings .
katharina wagner can expect that of the bayreuth audience , yet she also goes beyond that small elite group of bayreuth ticket-holders , venturing into the worlds of local public viewing and internet broadcasting worldwide . beyond the green hill public viewing , simultaneous live stream and audio-on-demand continue with a different work on aug .
9 : christoph marthaler 's four-year-old setting of " tristan and isolde , " which opened the festival on july 25 . though bayreuth was late to jump on the multimedia bandwagon , bigger and better projects are reportedly in the works on the green hill . it was announced that the wagners are planning performances of their great-grandfather 's early works in the city of bayreuth -lrb- though not in the festspielhaus -rrb- , and that the new production of the ring cycle in the richard wagner bicentennial year 2013 will be publicly viewed and broadcast on the web . bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner 's daughters are softening the tone he set author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by working for charitable organisations they aim to improve their social skills and change corporate culture . barbara zastrozynski works for a large insurance company in duesseldorf .
she 's an it manager in charge of a team of more than 50 employees .
as part of a training program for her company she volunteered to take part in changing sides – for a week she 's working with homeless people .
" i was very curious about the whole thing , " she says .
" as an executive you get to view people more and more simply as a resource .
so my interest was to get back to seeing people as people , rather than resources that we allocate to this or that job . "
for a week she 's been helping to hand out food and coffee in a soup kitchen and taken part in counselling sessions .
she was surrounded by people and problems she would never have encountered in her own life .
she said it was like living in a different world with men and women who have to struggle for survival on a daily basis .
" i was deeply moved by what i 've seen .
especially that day i spent with the streetworkers outside – we 've been to places i 'd never been to before , met people i never had contact with before , " she says .
strengthening corporate culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : challenges faced by the homeless make those faced by managers seem minor the idea behind changing sides comes from switzerland .
it was developed especially for to executives , with the goal of strengthening their social skills .
nine years ago , the concept was introduced in germany .
maria wrede of a volunteers organisation in cologne , is head of the local changing sides project .
" it 's very important that companies realize that they have a social responsibility .
and they can fulfil that responsibility only through their employees .
the best place to start is at the top , to provide a good example .
this will help corporate culture and strengthen ethics within the company , " wrede says .
so far , around 1,000 managers have participated in the program , the insurance company where barbara zastrozynksi works sends people on a regular basis to spend a week with the changing sides program .
mario vaupel is head of human resources at the insurance giant .
" it 's quite important for the management to see that there are other areas in life where ' managing ' is also very difficult , " he explains .
" the problems and challenges that a drug addict faces are much more difficult and they still have to get by .
we are convinced that our management can really learn something from that experience .
they see how comparatively easy their daily tasks are if viewed from a completely different perspective . "
vaupel is in charge of selecting and sending the companies managers to take part in changing sides .
the cost is 2,500 euros per person , but he 's convinced that in the end the company can profit from that investment .
his goal is that even more of the staff take part in the program so that a growing sense of social responsibility can impact on the corporate culture on a wider basis .

by working for charitable organisations they aim to improve their social skills and change corporate culture . barbara zastrozynski works for a large insurance company in duesseldorf .
she 's an it manager in charge of a team of more than 50 employees .
as part of a training program for her company she volunteered to take part in changing sides – for a week she 's working with homeless people .
" i was very curious about the whole thing , " she says .
" as an executive you get to view people more and more simply as a resource .
so my interest was to get back to seeing people as people , rather than resources that we allocate to this or that job . "
for a week she 's been helping to hand out food and coffee in a soup kitchen and taken part in counselling sessions .

it was developed especially for to executives , with the goal of strengthening their social skills .
nine years ago , the concept was introduced in germany .
maria wrede of a volunteers organisation in cologne , is head of the local changing sides project .
" it 's very important that companies realize that they have a social responsibility .
and they can fulfil that responsibility only through their employees .
the best place to start is at the top , to provide a good example .

" it 's quite important for the management to see that there are other areas in life where ' managing ' is also very difficult , " he explains .
" the problems and challenges that a drug addict faces are much more difficult and they still have to get by .
we are convinced that our management can really learn something from that experience .
they see how comparatively easy their daily tasks are if viewed from a completely different perspective . "
vaupel is in charge of selecting and sending the companies managers to take part in changing sides .
the cost is 2,500 euros per person , but he 's convinced that in the end the company can profit from that investment .
his goal is that even more of the staff take part in the program so that a growing sense of social responsibility can impact on the corporate culture on a wider basis .

a new era dawns at the bayreuth festival dark history still haunts bayreuth festival classical music -pipe- 27.07.2009 the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner sisters have n't changed much - but at least they 're talking to each other the 98th bayreuth festival has started its process of renewal by turning on the charm and changing its tone after a long war of attrition with the german press . " artistic stagnation " was the catchword back when wolfgang wagner , soon to turn 90 , was still festival director . in year one of the co-directorship of his daughters eva wagner-pasquier , 64 , and katharina wagner , 31 , there is little new to be seen onstage - actually , nothing , with no new productions this season .
yet change is in the air , if only in that these two wagners are n't at loggerheads with each other . considering the worldwide obsession with this most authentic of opera festivals - 133 years after it was founded , still doing what its founder richard wagner intended it to - it 's unusual that its image was defined for so long by newspaper critics . wolfgang wagner , richard wagner 's grandson , loved to engage the press in a spirit of confrontation .
in the last fifteen years of his tenure , it turned bitter and reflexive . pr plus musical excellence great-granddaughter katharina wagner is responsible for having revamped the web site -lrb- www.bayreuther-festspiele.de -rrb- , and also directs the incorporated subsidiary bayreuth medien , which handles multimedia aspects of the festival . pre-empting the press and setting the agenda herself , she has said that she has a clear sense of where the festival should position itself : at the forefront of wagner interpretation worldwide . and that will require more than public relations . hopes are placed in the management expertise of eva wagner-pasquier , in the new conductors announced in the coming seasons -lrb- andris nelsons , thomas henglebrock and kirill petrenko -rrb- , and in the prospect that today 's handful of truly exciting wagnerian singers will be heard in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is taking place this year for the 98th time repeat boos for katharina considering that katharina was once again booed for her production of " mastersingers , " it may take some time for the new artistic approach to establish itself .
apparently her new position at the helm does n't give her any bonus points with the critical bayreuth audience . but the musical rendition of " mastersingers " does n't get lost in the stage antics - and that 's saying quite a bit , considering that katharina wagner basically turns the story upside down . in " mastersingers , " there 's quite a bit of singing about singing , as the story revolves around the craft of composition for the voice .
katharina came up with a piece of stage direction about stage direction , with references to the history , not all of it savory , of stagings of the " mastersingers " since the premiere over 140 years ago .
the work was , after all , a favorite in the third reich . to be understood , this meta-level commentary requires an audience that knows the score , the words and a context of different stagings .
katharina wagner can expect that of the bayreuth audience , yet she also goes beyond that small elite group of bayreuth ticket-holders , venturing into the worlds of local public viewing and internet broadcasting worldwide . beyond the green hill public viewing , simultaneous live stream and audio-on-demand continue with a different work on aug .
9 : christoph marthaler 's four-year-old setting of " tristan and isolde , " which opened the festival on july 25 . though bayreuth was late to jump on the multimedia bandwagon , bigger and better projects are reportedly in the works on the green hill . it was announced that the wagners are planning performances of their great-grandfather 's early works in the city of bayreuth -lrb- though not in the festspielhaus -rrb- , and that the new production of the ring cycle in the richard wagner bicentennial year 2013 will be publicly viewed and broadcast on the web . bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner 's daughters are softening the tone he set author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

diplomats also reassured balkan states on iceland 's eu aspirations . although howls of protests had been raised , european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday gave the ok for further negotiations between the eu and the us on a new agreement to allow american authorities continued access to bank transfer data in terrorism investigations . the eu commission and the united states consider providing access to banking data of the swift banking transfer service essential in uncovering the financing of terror networks . swift , the society of worldwide interbank financial telecommunications , is moving its primary server and database from the united states to the netherlands .

" there is no unrestricted and unverified access ; on the contrary , there are clear rules and clear limits . " if the lisbon treaty comes into force in 2010 , as the eu hopes , the european parliament will have to approve any information sharing deals .
but the treaty would not come into effect until the end of the year at the earliest , leaving a gap of several months with the swift servers in europe .
during that time the us would have no access . that would be " extremely dangerous , " according to barrot , who said a temporary agreement lasting just a few months is needed .
if and when the lisbon treaty comes into force , a new deal will have to be drawn up and approved by the eu parliament . easing fears on iceland eu ministers also sought to reassure balkan countries eager to the join the bloc that iceland would not get special treatment and would undergo the same membership tests as them . while iceland has traditionally been uninterested in eu membership , the north atlantic island nation has seen its economy devastated by the global financial crisis and many there feel eu membership would boost its financial stability . bildunterschrift : iceland already fulfills many requirements for eu membership while eu accession negotiations generally take years , iceland 's eu path is expected to be shorter and smoother than most because of its long democratic tradition and existing treaties and agreements it already has with the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2009 iceland confident about eu membership talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skarphedinsson expects iceland to become a member within 3 years icelandic foreign minister ossur skarphedinsson says his country is in a strong position ahead of eu membership talks .
he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unions -pipe- 27.07.2009 german day care workers ' dispute comes to an end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new agreement would boost salaries and healthcare for about 220,000 people the six month long stand off between german public day care workers and their employers has come to an end as both sides agree to a compromise that would raise wages and provide better healthcare . employers and labor union representatives reached a compromise on monday after tense negotiations in the german city of frankfurt .
the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "
he estimates that the raises and new health plans will cost between 500 and 700 million euros a year and called it an " absolutely acceptable " result that will benefit both children and parents .
the head of the ver.di union , frank bsirske , admitted that the agreement is n't what they had hoped for , but said that they were successful in their mission to give more recognition to the profession .
bsirske called the new heath care plan , which gives the insured individuals the legal right to a risk assessment , " very important " .
the agreement also raises the starting salaries for some jobs and the current salaries and career expectations for others .
now the voting starts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disagreement led to day care workers going on strike across the country the agreement still has to be approved in a vote by union members , starting next week .
bsirske said that the compromise would be presented to the members this week before voting , which should take about two weeks .
if the agreement is approved , it will go into effect on november 1 .
bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .
however , the delegations from vka and gew , another labor union , had already agreed on the compromise , though even ilse schaad , member of the board of gew , admitted that the unions would n't have been able to get all their demands met .
the salary conflict , which has been going on since the end of january , led to day care workers across the country going on strike at the beginning of may. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "
he estimates that the raises and new health plans will cost between 500 and 700 million euros a year and called it an " absolutely acceptable " result that will benefit both children and parents .
the head of the ver.di union , frank bsirske , admitted that the agreement is n't what they had hoped for , but said that they were successful in their mission to give more recognition to the profession .
bsirske called the new heath care plan , which gives the insured individuals the legal right to a risk assessment , " very important " .
the agreement also raises the starting salaries for some jobs and the current salaries and career expectations for others .
now the voting starts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disagreement led to day care workers going on strike across the country the agreement still has to be approved in a vote by union members , starting next week .
bsirske said that the compromise would be presented to the members this week before voting , which should take about two weeks .
if the agreement is approved , it will go into effect on november 1 .
bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .
however , the delegations from vka and gew , another labor union , had already agreed on the compromise , though even ilse schaad , member of the board of gew , admitted that the unions would n't have been able to get all their demands met .

continued high temperatures around the mediterranean however , are turning forests dry and creating conditions for more fires . the worst affected countries were spain , france and italy and most of the blazes in those nations are now under control , but firefighters continue to remain on alert .
as an example , a fire that was thought to be under control near the spanish town of las hurdes flared up again due to strong winds and that forced the evacuation of more than 500 people .
the blaze burned over 500 hectares .
as temperatures remain high , spain 's interior ministry has kept the country on high alert for more wildfires .
the national weather office has issued an " orange " alert , the second highest level , for 24 provinces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2009 iceland confident about eu membership talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skarphedinsson expects iceland to become a member within 3 years icelandic foreign minister ossur skarphedinsson says his country is in a strong position ahead of eu membership talks .
he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2009 iceland confident about eu membership talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skarphedinsson expects iceland to become a member within 3 years icelandic foreign minister ossur skarphedinsson says his country is in a strong position ahead of eu membership talks .
he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 27.07.2009 eu top diplomats ok bank data talks , reassure on iceland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign ministers ok 'd talks on a new agreement on sharing eu banking data with the us eu foreign ministers have given the green light to talks with the us about access to bank details in terrorism investigations .
diplomats also reassured balkan states on iceland 's eu aspirations . although howls of protests had been raised , european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday gave the ok for further negotiations between the eu and the us on a new agreement to allow american authorities continued access to bank transfer data in terrorism investigations . the eu commission and the united states consider providing access to banking data of the swift banking transfer service essential in uncovering the financing of terror networks . swift , the society of worldwide interbank financial telecommunications , is moving its primary server and database from the united states to the netherlands .
without a new agreement , the change of location would leave american officials with access only to information on americans .
the us would then have to ask individual eu countries for access to their data . the ministers approved a mandate for the european commission , the eu 's executive , to negotiate an agreement . german and european politicians from across the political spectrum have been vociferous in their condemnation of the proposed bank data transfer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting and greeting at the brussels pow-wow " it is completely disproportionate and excessive that banking data is to be transferred even if no suspicion exists , " said juergen trittin , german green party parliamentary group leader .
" that the eu wants to allow this kind of wholesale spying is not acceptable . " but law-enforcement officials on both sides of the atlantic have supported the data access , and the eu says us oversight has been an " important and effective tool " in fighting terrorism financing and preventing attacks . " it is no question of giving the us a blank check , as some critics seem to suggest , " eu justice commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" there is no unrestricted and unverified access ; on the contrary , there are clear rules and clear limits . " if the lisbon treaty comes into force in 2010 , as the eu hopes , the european parliament will have to approve any information sharing deals .
but the treaty would not come into effect until the end of the year at the earliest , leaving a gap of several months with the swift servers in europe .
during that time the us would have no access . that would be " extremely dangerous , " according to barrot , who said a temporary agreement lasting just a few months is needed .
if and when the lisbon treaty comes into force , a new deal will have to be drawn up and approved by the eu parliament . easing fears on iceland eu ministers also sought to reassure balkan countries eager to the join the bloc that iceland would not get special treatment and would undergo the same membership tests as them . while iceland has traditionally been uninterested in eu membership , the north atlantic island nation has seen its economy devastated by the global financial crisis and many there feel eu membership would boost its financial stability . bildunterschrift : iceland already fulfills many requirements for eu membership while eu accession negotiations generally take years , iceland 's eu path is expected to be shorter and smoother than most because of its long democratic tradition and existing treaties and agreements it already has with the eu .
iceland is a member of the european free trade association and the european economic area trading groups . however , on monday , the eu 's current president , sweden , said iceland can not expect fast-track entry . " there is no fast-track for iceland but rather a shorter track because they are already a part of the single market and the schengen area , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt told reporters ahead of monday 's meeting . bildt said iceland 's eu ambitions should not overshadow those of the balkan states . " we need to focus on the western balkans , " he said , referring to the former yugoslav countries and albania .
only one of those , slovenia , is currently an eu member . " there is a need for momentum on european integration in the balkans , " he said . british foreign secretary david miliband agreed : " there is no chance of the balkans being forgotten , " he said .
" it is not about one country being privileged over another , it is about all countries being treated equally and fairly . " global hot spots the around 200 unarmed eu ceasefire monitors in georgia posted there since the country 's war with its russia-backed breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia last year will stay until at least september 2010 , the foreign ministers agreed . " the mission 's presence on the ground remains a key stabilizing factor , " read a joint statement approved at the brussels meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu observers have been on the ground in georgia since last august 's conflict with russia the eu mission is the only international mission on the ground in georgia now , since russia vetoed the extension of un and osce observer missions that had been there previously . the eu " noted with deep regret and concern that agreement has not been reached on the future of the un and osce monitoring missions in georgia .
this development further underscores the crucial role of eumm georgia , " the statement said , referring to the eu monitoring mission . keeping in line with a united nations resolution , the eu adopted reinforced sanctions against north korea over its nuclear and weapons tests . the ministers passed without discussion a move to enforce un security council resolution 1874 " in a robust way as requested " by eu leaders at a summit last month , a statement said . the eu decided , in addition to un sanctions , on the " autonomous listing of items subject to export ban , autonomous listing of persons and entities subject to travel ban and asset freeze , enhanced financial vigilance and reinforced cargo inspections . " north korea quit six-party talks aimed at ending its nuclear weapons program after the security council censured it for a long-range rocket launch in april .
in may , pyongyang also staged a second nuclear test . jam / dpa / reuters / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

diplomats also reassured balkan states on iceland 's eu aspirations . although howls of protests had been raised , european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday gave the ok for further negotiations between the eu and the us on a new agreement to allow american authorities continued access to bank transfer data in terrorism investigations . the eu commission and the united states consider providing access to banking data of the swift banking transfer service essential in uncovering the financing of terror networks . swift , the society of worldwide interbank financial telecommunications , is moving its primary server and database from the united states to the netherlands .
without a new agreement , the change of location would leave american officials with access only to information on americans .
the us would then have to ask individual eu countries for access to their data . the ministers approved a mandate for the european commission , the eu 's executive , to negotiate an agreement . german and european politicians from across the political spectrum have been vociferous in their condemnation of the proposed bank data transfer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting and greeting at the brussels pow-wow " it is completely disproportionate and excessive that banking data is to be transferred even if no suspicion exists , " said juergen trittin , german green party parliamentary group leader .
" that the eu wants to allow this kind of wholesale spying is not acceptable . " but law-enforcement officials on both sides of the atlantic have supported the data access , and the eu says us oversight has been an " important and effective tool " in fighting terrorism financing and preventing attacks . " it is no question of giving the us a blank check , as some critics seem to suggest , " eu justice commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" there is no unrestricted and unverified access ; on the contrary , there are clear rules and clear limits . " if the lisbon treaty comes into force in 2010 , as the eu hopes , the european parliament will have to approve any information sharing deals .
but the treaty would not come into effect until the end of the year at the earliest , leaving a gap of several months with the swift servers in europe .
during that time the us would have no access . that would be " extremely dangerous , " according to barrot , who said a temporary agreement lasting just a few months is needed .
if and when the lisbon treaty comes into force , a new deal will have to be drawn up and approved by the eu parliament . easing fears on iceland eu ministers also sought to reassure balkan countries eager to the join the bloc that iceland would not get special treatment and would undergo the same membership tests as them . while iceland has traditionally been uninterested in eu membership , the north atlantic island nation has seen its economy devastated by the global financial crisis and many there feel eu membership would boost its financial stability . bildunterschrift : iceland already fulfills many requirements for eu membership while eu accession negotiations generally take years , iceland 's eu path is expected to be shorter and smoother than most because of its long democratic tradition and existing treaties and agreements it already has with the eu .
iceland is a member of the european free trade association and the european economic area trading groups . however , on monday , the eu 's current president , sweden , said iceland can not expect fast-track entry . " there is no fast-track for iceland but rather a shorter track because they are already a part of the single market and the schengen area , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt told reporters ahead of monday 's meeting . bildt said iceland 's eu ambitions should not overshadow those of the balkan states . " we need to focus on the western balkans , " he said , referring to the former yugoslav countries and albania .
only one of those , slovenia , is currently an eu member . " there is a need for momentum on european integration in the balkans , " he said . british foreign secretary david miliband agreed : " there is no chance of the balkans being forgotten , " he said .
" it is not about one country being privileged over another , it is about all countries being treated equally and fairly . " global hot spots the around 200 unarmed eu ceasefire monitors in georgia posted there since the country 's war with its russia-backed breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia last year will stay until at least september 2010 , the foreign ministers agreed .

" strategic progress relies on undermining the insurgency through politics , " miliband said as he called for " a political strategy for dealing with the insurgency through re-integration and reconciliation . "
in miliband 's view , the afghan insurgents are " a wide but shallow coalition of convenience , " and are therefore divisible .

her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .
reiner holznagel from the taxpayers ' union , a pressure group , accused her of waffling : " mrs schmidt has gone back and forth .
" when we asked her on saturday , she said she was not using the official car for private purposes and that she had her own car on site .
in the meantime , the ministry said she was in fact using it for private purposes and was paying for it .
" the fact remains that the car had to go from berlin to alicante and that costs a lot of money , " holznagel told news channel n24 .

her social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said schmidt took part in a telephone conference from spain with party leaders and affirmed that she had only used the car in compliance with german law .
spd party general secretary hubertus heil said she had voiced willingness to answer questions in parliament about her actions .
" a government car allocated to you personally can legally be used for private purposes .
ulla schmidt was acting within the law , " said heil .
a health ministry spokesman also defended her , telling reporters schmidt always repaid the government for any private trips in the car .
" it 's cheaper to drive a car there for her , as it costs 500 euros to go there and back in petrol .
that 's the per diem cost of hiring a car like that in spain , " he said .
ministerial cars in germany are armour-plated to protect against assassinations .
the spokesman rejected questions about whether a meeting with elderly germas living on the costa blanca justified sending the car 5,000 kilometres to shuttle schmidt a short distance .
" it does n't matter whether she had one , five or a dozen official appointments : it is simply her right , " the official said .
the ministry added that schmidt had flown to spain at her own expense and had only been using the vehicle for official engagements .
heavy criticism still , the claim that schmidt 's use of the car was legal may not wash with the public , and certainly has not kept her political rivals from rounding on her .
patrick doering , an mp for the opposition pro-business free democrats , said : " i can not imagine that the german embassy in madrid was not in a position to drive the minister to one or several events . "
georg schirmbeck , a christian democrat , joined ranks with opposition voices criticizing schmidt .
it was a " scandalous waste of taxpayers ' money that the spd politician sent her official car plus chauffeur across europe to her spanish holiday resort , " schirmbeck told german daily neue osnabruecker zeitung .
reiner holznagel from the taxpayers ' union , a pressure group , accused her of waffling : " mrs schmidt has gone back and forth .
" when we asked her on saturday , she said she was not using the official car for private purposes and that she had her own car on site .
in the meantime , the ministry said she was in fact using it for private purposes and was paying for it .
" the fact remains that the car had to go from berlin to alicante and that costs a lot of money , " holznagel told news channel n24 .
the timing of the growing scandal is unfortunate for the spd , which had hoped to use a quiet political week to gear up their election campaign , ahead of germany 's general election on september 27. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new era dawns at the bayreuth festival dark history still haunts bayreuth festival classical music -pipe- 27.07.2009 the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner sisters have n't changed much - but at least they 're talking to each other the 98th bayreuth festival has started its process of renewal by turning on the charm and changing its tone after a long war of attrition with the german press . " artistic stagnation " was the catchword back when wolfgang wagner , soon to turn 90 , was still festival director . in year one of the co-directorship of his daughters eva wagner-pasquier , 64 , and katharina wagner , 31 , there is little new to be seen onstage - actually , nothing , with no new productions this season .
yet change is in the air , if only in that these two wagners are n't at loggerheads with each other . considering the worldwide obsession with this most authentic of opera festivals - 133 years after it was founded , still doing what its founder richard wagner intended it to - it 's unusual that its image was defined for so long by newspaper critics . wolfgang wagner , richard wagner 's grandson , loved to engage the press in a spirit of confrontation .
in the last fifteen years of his tenure , it turned bitter and reflexive . pr plus musical excellence great-granddaughter katharina wagner is responsible for having revamped the web site -lrb- www.bayreuther-festspiele.de -rrb- , and also directs the incorporated subsidiary bayreuth medien , which handles multimedia aspects of the festival . pre-empting the press and setting the agenda herself , she has said that she has a clear sense of where the festival should position itself : at the forefront of wagner interpretation worldwide . and that will require more than public relations . hopes are placed in the management expertise of eva wagner-pasquier , in the new conductors announced in the coming seasons -lrb- andris nelsons , thomas henglebrock and kirill petrenko -rrb- , and in the prospect that today 's handful of truly exciting wagnerian singers will be heard in bayreuth . bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival is taking place this year for the 98th time repeat boos for katharina considering that katharina was once again booed for her production of " mastersingers , " it may take some time for the new artistic approach to establish itself .
apparently her new position at the helm does n't give her any bonus points with the critical bayreuth audience . but the musical rendition of " mastersingers " does n't get lost in the stage antics - and that 's saying quite a bit , considering that katharina wagner basically turns the story upside down . in " mastersingers , " there 's quite a bit of singing about singing , as the story revolves around the craft of composition for the voice .
katharina came up with a piece of stage direction about stage direction , with references to the history , not all of it savory , of stagings of the " mastersingers " since the premiere over 140 years ago .
the work was , after all , a favorite in the third reich . to be understood , this meta-level commentary requires an audience that knows the score , the words and a context of different stagings .
katharina wagner can expect that of the bayreuth audience , yet she also goes beyond that small elite group of bayreuth ticket-holders , venturing into the worlds of local public viewing and internet broadcasting worldwide . beyond the green hill public viewing , simultaneous live stream and audio-on-demand continue with a different work on aug .

by working for charitable organisations they aim to improve their social skills and change corporate culture . barbara zastrozynski works for a large insurance company in duesseldorf .
she 's an it manager in charge of a team of more than 50 employees .
as part of a training program for her company she volunteered to take part in changing sides – for a week she 's working with homeless people .
" i was very curious about the whole thing , " she says .
" as an executive you get to view people more and more simply as a resource .
so my interest was to get back to seeing people as people , rather than resources that we allocate to this or that job . "
for a week she 's been helping to hand out food and coffee in a soup kitchen and taken part in counselling sessions .
she was surrounded by people and problems she would never have encountered in her own life .
she said it was like living in a different world with men and women who have to struggle for survival on a daily basis .
" i was deeply moved by what i 've seen .
especially that day i spent with the streetworkers outside – we 've been to places i 'd never been to before , met people i never had contact with before , " she says .
strengthening corporate culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : challenges faced by the homeless make those faced by managers seem minor the idea behind changing sides comes from switzerland .
it was developed especially for to executives , with the goal of strengthening their social skills .
nine years ago , the concept was introduced in germany .
maria wrede of a volunteers organisation in cologne , is head of the local changing sides project .
" it 's very important that companies realize that they have a social responsibility .
and they can fulfil that responsibility only through their employees .
the best place to start is at the top , to provide a good example .
this will help corporate culture and strengthen ethics within the company , " wrede says .
so far , around 1,000 managers have participated in the program , the insurance company where barbara zastrozynksi works sends people on a regular basis to spend a week with the changing sides program .
mario vaupel is head of human resources at the insurance giant .
" it 's quite important for the management to see that there are other areas in life where ' managing ' is also very difficult , " he explains .
" the problems and challenges that a drug addict faces are much more difficult and they still have to get by .
we are convinced that our management can really learn something from that experience .

" the lion 's share of these limited supplies will go to wealthy countries , " who director margaret chan said last week .

again we see access denied by an inability to pay . " high demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many rich countries have plans to vaccinate large swaths of the population the united states has set aside at least a billion dollars to buy vaccine , and britain hopes to protect at least half of its 60 million population by the start of next year and the other half as soon as possible thereafter . german states have said they intend to purchase 50 million doses of the drug and would consider buying more if the need arose .
health ministers agreed to buy mass vaccinations in september . france has placed a firm order for 94 million doses of vaccine doses and an option for 36 million more .
starting in october , it hopes to be able to protect each and every member of its population of 64 million .

" vaccine for 30 percent of the population is enough to vaccinate the 7 million people in the health sector , another seven million in the public service and risk groups such as pregnant women or children , " peter wutzler , president of the german association for the fight against viral disease , told the afp news agency . mutation still possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus could become more - or less - dangerous if it mutates the who has said it is engaged in talks with pharmaceutical companies to donate or provide the drug to developing nations at lower cost .

this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . anyone who does n't know the berlin art scene well probably imagines it as being centred around small , hidden entrances leading into dilapidated buildings whose exteriors are liberally covered with graffiti .
the interior is inevitably in an equally poor condition , with pictures - selected by a young person who looks barely old enough to have completed university - hanging on crumbling walls . at least in one case , that stereotype described reality to a t - at styx gallery in berlin . michael rade is 26 years old and has been managing his own art gallery for a year . between prenzlauer berg and friedrichshein , rade 's gallery is located at the heart of the district that the berlin art scene calls home . an unlikely mixture : beer and art the styx gallery is housed in a massive building that used to be a former brewery .
naturally , it 's covered in graffiti . after opening the door with a cardboard sign reading " artists.com " on it , one is immediately hit by a damp , musty smell , no doubt caused by the small puddle of rainwater collecting near the entrance .
the next sense to be attacked is the hearing .
from an unknown corner , a radio fills the room with spanish music while hammering and knocking emanates from another part of the building . bildunterschrift : renovation would ruin the gallery 's atmosphere , says michael rade a trail of candles the words " just keep following the candlelight " echo from the other end of the gloomy corridor , followed by " the electricity is out today . "
due to this unexpected development , rade has arranged a trail of candles leading into his gallery . there , he sits in one corner of the 120-square-meter -lrb- nearly 11-square-foot -rrb- whitewashed room he ironically calls the " white cube . "
ironically - because the modern , clinically clean atmosphere that a " white cube gallery " conjures up does n't have anything to do with the poorly plastered walls and small windows in this place . london was a " tough nut to crack " a typical 26-year-old , one would think , has just finished his studies , is taking the first tentative steps towards a career , and may occasionally visit the odd art gallery .
but rade already has all of this behind him . in his quiet voice he tells how , after having completed his graphic design studies in hamburg , he was pulled towards london , one of the iconic style capitals of the world .

" then he discovered the white cube in berlin and one thing was clear : this would become his new gallery . bildunterschrift : the entrance to the " white cube " a matter of taste currently , styx is displaying the work of london-based artist emc collard , who rade knows personally from his time there .
but this is not normal practice in his gallery . typically , rade comes across artists over the internet and , if he likes their work , arranges a meeting to discuss a possible exhibition . if a deal is reached , the artist receives 50 percent of any piece sold , while the young curator keeps the other half . all artists whose work he has exhibited are also featured on his web site .

this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . anyone who does n't know the berlin art scene well probably imagines it as being centred around small , hidden entrances leading into dilapidated buildings whose exteriors are liberally covered with graffiti .
the interior is inevitably in an equally poor condition , with pictures - selected by a young person who looks barely old enough to have completed university - hanging on crumbling walls . at least in one case , that stereotype described reality to a t - at styx gallery in berlin . michael rade is 26 years old and has been managing his own art gallery for a year . between prenzlauer berg and friedrichshein , rade 's gallery is located at the heart of the district that the berlin art scene calls home . an unlikely mixture : beer and art the styx gallery is housed in a massive building that used to be a former brewery .
naturally , it 's covered in graffiti . after opening the door with a cardboard sign reading " artists.com " on it , one is immediately hit by a damp , musty smell , no doubt caused by the small puddle of rainwater collecting near the entrance .
the next sense to be attacked is the hearing .
from an unknown corner , a radio fills the room with spanish music while hammering and knocking emanates from another part of the building . bildunterschrift : renovation would ruin the gallery 's atmosphere , says michael rade a trail of candles the words " just keep following the candlelight " echo from the other end of the gloomy corridor , followed by " the electricity is out today . "
due to this unexpected development , rade has arranged a trail of candles leading into his gallery . there , he sits in one corner of the 120-square-meter -lrb- nearly 11-square-foot -rrb- whitewashed room he ironically calls the " white cube . "
ironically - because the modern , clinically clean atmosphere that a " white cube gallery " conjures up does n't have anything to do with the poorly plastered walls and small windows in this place . london was a " tough nut to crack " a typical 26-year-old , one would think , has just finished his studies , is taking the first tentative steps towards a career , and may occasionally visit the odd art gallery .
but rade already has all of this behind him . in his quiet voice he tells how , after having completed his graphic design studies in hamburg , he was pulled towards london , one of the iconic style capitals of the world .

" then he discovered the white cube in berlin and one thing was clear : this would become his new gallery . bildunterschrift : the entrance to the " white cube " a matter of taste currently , styx is displaying the work of london-based artist emc collard , who rade knows personally from his time there .
but this is not normal practice in his gallery . typically , rade comes across artists over the internet and , if he likes their work , arranges a meeting to discuss a possible exhibition . if a deal is reached , the artist receives 50 percent of any piece sold , while the young curator keeps the other half . all artists whose work he has exhibited are also featured on his web site .

the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "
he estimates that the raises and new health plans will cost between 500 and 700 million euros a year and called it an " absolutely acceptable " result that will benefit both children and parents .
the head of the ver.di union , frank bsirske , admitted that the agreement is n't what they had hoped for , but said that they were successful in their mission to give more recognition to the profession .
bsirske called the new heath care plan , which gives the insured individuals the legal right to a risk assessment , " very important " .
the agreement also raises the starting salaries for some jobs and the current salaries and career expectations for others .
now the voting starts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disagreement led to day care workers going on strike across the country the agreement still has to be approved in a vote by union members , starting next week .
bsirske said that the compromise would be presented to the members this week before voting , which should take about two weeks .
if the agreement is approved , it will go into effect on november 1 .
bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .
however , the delegations from vka and gew , another labor union , had already agreed on the compromise , though even ilse schaad , member of the board of gew , admitted that the unions would n't have been able to get all their demands met .
the salary conflict , which has been going on since the end of january , led to day care workers across the country going on strike at the beginning of may. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agreement envisages higher wages and better healthcare for the roughly 220,000 people working in welfare facilities and municipal day care centers , known as kindertagesstätten , or kitas , in german .
employers have indicated that those working in public day cares will each receive an average of 150 euros -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- more a month , though labor unions said they had wanted more .
the president of the vka labor union compared the agreement to a " forceps delivery " after a " difficult operation . "
he estimates that the raises and new health plans will cost between 500 and 700 million euros a year and called it an " absolutely acceptable " result that will benefit both children and parents .
the head of the ver.di union , frank bsirske , admitted that the agreement is n't what they had hoped for , but said that they were successful in their mission to give more recognition to the profession .
bsirske called the new heath care plan , which gives the insured individuals the legal right to a risk assessment , " very important " .
the agreement also raises the starting salaries for some jobs and the current salaries and career expectations for others .
now the voting starts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disagreement led to day care workers going on strike across the country the agreement still has to be approved in a vote by union members , starting next week .
bsirske said that the compromise would be presented to the members this week before voting , which should take about two weeks .
if the agreement is approved , it will go into effect on november 1 .
bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .
however , the delegations from vka and gew , another labor union , had already agreed on the compromise , though even ilse schaad , member of the board of gew , admitted that the unions would n't have been able to get all their demands met .

bsirske explained that there has been a long list of demands piling up for social and child care workers that this agreement still does n't completely make up for , which led to a very controversial discussion among the ver.di strike organizers .
however , the delegations from vka and gew , another labor union , had already agreed on the compromise , though even ilse schaad , member of the board of gew , admitted that the unions would n't have been able to get all their demands met .
the salary conflict , which has been going on since the end of january , led to day care workers across the country going on strike at the beginning of may. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

distanced from the establishment , they are the real avant-garde of the art world .
this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . anyone who does n't know the berlin art scene well probably imagines it as being centred around small , hidden entrances leading into dilapidated buildings whose exteriors are liberally covered with graffiti .
the interior is inevitably in an equally poor condition , with pictures - selected by a young person who looks barely old enough to have completed university - hanging on crumbling walls . at least in one case , that stereotype described reality to a t - at styx gallery in berlin . michael rade is 26 years old and has been managing his own art gallery for a year . between prenzlauer berg and friedrichshein , rade 's gallery is located at the heart of the district that the berlin art scene calls home . an unlikely mixture : beer and art the styx gallery is housed in a massive building that used to be a former brewery .
naturally , it 's covered in graffiti . after opening the door with a cardboard sign reading " artists.com " on it , one is immediately hit by a damp , musty smell , no doubt caused by the small puddle of rainwater collecting near the entrance .
the next sense to be attacked is the hearing .
from an unknown corner , a radio fills the room with spanish music while hammering and knocking emanates from another part of the building . bildunterschrift : renovation would ruin the gallery 's atmosphere , says michael rade a trail of candles the words " just keep following the candlelight " echo from the other end of the gloomy corridor , followed by " the electricity is out today . "
due to this unexpected development , rade has arranged a trail of candles leading into his gallery . there , he sits in one corner of the 120-square-meter -lrb- nearly 11-square-foot -rrb- whitewashed room he ironically calls the " white cube . "
ironically - because the modern , clinically clean atmosphere that a " white cube gallery " conjures up does n't have anything to do with the poorly plastered walls and small windows in this place . london was a " tough nut to crack " a typical 26-year-old , one would think , has just finished his studies , is taking the first tentative steps towards a career , and may occasionally visit the odd art gallery .
but rade already has all of this behind him . in his quiet voice he tells how , after having completed his graphic design studies in hamburg , he was pulled towards london , one of the iconic style capitals of the world .
there he began to organize art exhibitions for friends until he realized that the london art scene " is a tough nut to crack . " then he discovered the white cube in berlin and one thing was clear : this would become his new gallery . bildunterschrift : the entrance to the " white cube " a matter of taste currently , styx is displaying the work of london-based artist emc collard , who rade knows personally from his time there .
but this is not normal practice in his gallery . typically , rade comes across artists over the internet and , if he likes their work , arranges a meeting to discuss a possible exhibition . if a deal is reached , the artist receives 50 percent of any piece sold , while the young curator keeps the other half . all artists whose work he has exhibited are also featured on his web site . " that is the least that i can do form them , " says stade . " i ca n't represent them at art conventions and i do n't yet have a portfolio . " nevertheless , some of the artists have been able to utilize styx as a springboard to more prestigious endeavors . bildunterschrift : rade keeps half of what the artwork sells for renovation awaits though he 's just gotten started , rade has already enjoyed considerable success with his small gallery . between 50 and 300 visitors attend each exhibition 's grand opening and each piece from his current display sells for anywhere between 490 and 3,300 euros . but whether styx can grow and become a major player in the berlin art scene is doubtful . the former brewery belongs to an investor who occasionally pops by to see how the young curator is doing . he currently plans to have the white cube renovated , which would mean rade would have to relocate - a prospect he 's not looking forward to . if the walls are replastered , the holes in the roof plugged , and the graffiti removed , the " great charm " of the building would be lost forever , says rade . authors : elena singer / andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2009 iceland confident about eu membership talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skarphedinsson expects iceland to become a member within 3 years icelandic foreign minister ossur skarphedinsson says his country is in a strong position ahead of eu membership talks .
he told deutsche welle that despite the finanical crisis , iceland has a lot to offer brussels . european union foreign ministers on monday discussed the prospects of iceland joining the european union .
at the height of the financial crisis , the small island nation in the atlantic was on the brink of bankruptcy .
three months after snap elections in april 2009 , the new government has officially applied for eu membership .
dw : the last eu enlargement took place in january 2007 , when romania and bulgaria brought the number of member nations to 27 .
would you have thought then that iceland might become the eu 's 28th member state ?
ossur skarphedinsson : no , i would n't have dreamt it at the time .
of course i thought that countries like croatia would be accepted first but they have run into some problems .
nevertheless , i would have anticipated that iceland would be far up in the queue .
now i 'm quite happy .
these are difficult days for iceland and there are not a lot of things that make you happy .
of all the members of parliament i am the one who has been campaigning for iceland 's accession to the european union the longest .
however , i know this is just the beginning of a long journey .
what can the eu offer iceland ?
if you look at the decades ahead , the eu for example can offer shelter in terms of security .
one overlooked reason for our decision to apply for eu membership is that we are in the midst of re-defining our foreign policy and security .
we always lived in the belief that we would be sheltered by the united states of america .
when the americans left with their base in 2006 , we really had to look for another group of nations to belong to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's kaupthing bank was the country 's most prominent victim of the financial crisis in the short term , adopting the euro is definitely one of the things we are hoping for .
why ?
because perhaps the most bitter experience that we had in recent years – long before the present crisis – was that it is very difficult for a small nation like ourselves to maintain and protect an independent micro-currency in a world that is globalized .
in the still shorter term i think just the decision to apply calms down our neighbours and the environment that we live in .
and it creates more confidence and trust of other nations and that 's what we need most now , after the crisis .
what can iceland offer the eu ?
quite a lot .
for example we can offer the european union our knowledge and experience in how to preserve and utilize our renewable resources in europe .
we here in iceland are experts in the utilization of geothermal energy , which i think is a potential source of energy that europe has neglected .
we have tried to preach this gospel in brussels but it has fallen on deaf ears .
i think with iceland inside the european union , we could lead the way in utilizing renewable energy .
our geography is something that is attractive to the eu .
within some decades the changing world climate will open a new gateway from the pacific via the arctic ocean to the north atlantic .
and then certainly iceland – isolated today – will be a centre point in a new transport route between two continents .
do n't forget that iceland in the future will probably also be an oil-producing country .
another thing is the experience we have in managing fisheries .
if you look at the fisheries of europe you see fishing stocks that are over-exploited .
we here in iceland have managed our stocks well .
even in times of crisis if there is a need for experts to cut down the quota of our fishing stocks , we do it .
bildunterschrift : iceland 's capital reykjavik used to be a hub for international finance - but in 2008 the country was among the worst hit in the global subprime mortgage crisis at the same time , the fisheries will remain a sticking point in the accession talks ?
i have never tried to hide the fact that the most difficult hurdle that we 'll have to clear in the negotiations with brussels is the fisheries issue .
but i take heart from the fact that there is a will within the eu to move decisions away from centralized headquarters to the regions where the fishing stocks are utilized .
those that are dependent on resources are always the best people to care of them .
how strong is iceland 's position in the accession talks ?
i am confident to say our position is strong .
when we start the negotiation process , we are not beginning from a weak point .
some people might think so because we have been going through a crisis .
but even without the application or the eu membership we would get ourselves out of this recession quite quickly .
already in 2011 you will see economic growth here .
so i 'm not too worried about the future and we will not start the negotiations with the thought in our minds that we can not live without europe .
we can .
a prognosis : when will iceland join the eu ?
a lot of people think that negotiations will be short .
this is because we are members of the eea -lrb- european economic area -rrb- and schengen , meaning that we have already adopted 75 percent of the regulations and directives of brussels .
but i am not that optimistic .
i think it will be quite a tough negotiation process which will take a longer time than people anticipate .
the discussions on fisheries especially and perhaps also on agriculture will take quite a bit longer than people think .
so i would speculate on iceland being a possible member of the eu in three years .

diplomats also reassured balkan states on iceland 's eu aspirations . although howls of protests had been raised , european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday gave the ok for further negotiations between the eu and the us on a new agreement to allow american authorities continued access to bank transfer data in terrorism investigations . the eu commission and the united states consider providing access to banking data of the swift banking transfer service essential in uncovering the financing of terror networks . swift , the society of worldwide interbank financial telecommunications , is moving its primary server and database from the united states to the netherlands .
without a new agreement , the change of location would leave american officials with access only to information on americans .
the us would then have to ask individual eu countries for access to their data . the ministers approved a mandate for the european commission , the eu 's executive , to negotiate an agreement . german and european politicians from across the political spectrum have been vociferous in their condemnation of the proposed bank data transfer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting and greeting at the brussels pow-wow " it is completely disproportionate and excessive that banking data is to be transferred even if no suspicion exists , " said juergen trittin , german green party parliamentary group leader .
" that the eu wants to allow this kind of wholesale spying is not acceptable . " but law-enforcement officials on both sides of the atlantic have supported the data access , and the eu says us oversight has been an " important and effective tool " in fighting terrorism financing and preventing attacks . " it is no question of giving the us a blank check , as some critics seem to suggest , " eu justice commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" there is no unrestricted and unverified access ; on the contrary , there are clear rules and clear limits . " if the lisbon treaty comes into force in 2010 , as the eu hopes , the european parliament will have to approve any information sharing deals .
but the treaty would not come into effect until the end of the year at the earliest , leaving a gap of several months with the swift servers in europe .
during that time the us would have no access . that would be " extremely dangerous , " according to barrot , who said a temporary agreement lasting just a few months is needed .
if and when the lisbon treaty comes into force , a new deal will have to be drawn up and approved by the eu parliament . easing fears on iceland eu ministers also sought to reassure balkan countries eager to the join the bloc that iceland would not get special treatment and would undergo the same membership tests as them . while iceland has traditionally been uninterested in eu membership , the north atlantic island nation has seen its economy devastated by the global financial crisis and many there feel eu membership would boost its financial stability . bildunterschrift : iceland already fulfills many requirements for eu membership while eu accession negotiations generally take years , iceland 's eu path is expected to be shorter and smoother than most because of its long democratic tradition and existing treaties and agreements it already has with the eu .
iceland is a member of the european free trade association and the european economic area trading groups . however , on monday , the eu 's current president , sweden , said iceland can not expect fast-track entry . " there is no fast-track for iceland but rather a shorter track because they are already a part of the single market and the schengen area , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt told reporters ahead of monday 's meeting . bildt said iceland 's eu ambitions should not overshadow those of the balkan states . " we need to focus on the western balkans , " he said , referring to the former yugoslav countries and albania .
only one of those , slovenia , is currently an eu member . " there is a need for momentum on european integration in the balkans , " he said . british foreign secretary david miliband agreed : " there is no chance of the balkans being forgotten , " he said .
" it is not about one country being privileged over another , it is about all countries being treated equally and fairly . " global hot spots the around 200 unarmed eu ceasefire monitors in georgia posted there since the country 's war with its russia-backed breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia last year will stay until at least september 2010 , the foreign ministers agreed . " the mission 's presence on the ground remains a key stabilizing factor , " read a joint statement approved at the brussels meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu observers have been on the ground in georgia since last august 's conflict with russia the eu mission is the only international mission on the ground in georgia now , since russia vetoed the extension of un and osce observer missions that had been there previously . the eu " noted with deep regret and concern that agreement has not been reached on the future of the un and osce monitoring missions in georgia .
this development further underscores the crucial role of eumm georgia , " the statement said , referring to the eu monitoring mission . keeping in line with a united nations resolution , the eu adopted reinforced sanctions against north korea over its nuclear and weapons tests . the ministers passed without discussion a move to enforce un security council resolution 1874 " in a robust way as requested " by eu leaders at a summit last month , a statement said . the eu decided , in addition to un sanctions , on the " autonomous listing of items subject to export ban , autonomous listing of persons and entities subject to travel ban and asset freeze , enhanced financial vigilance and reinforced cargo inspections . " north korea quit six-party talks aimed at ending its nuclear weapons program after the security council censured it for a long-range rocket launch in april .

low inflation leads to increased spending and despite the ongoing recession , most people seem to expect the crisis to be over soon . consumers have pinned their hopes on an early end to the crisis .
a closely watched study on consumer confidence suggests that a combination of economic optimism and record-low inflation has german consumer confidence surging in august .
the forward-looking gfk index , which was released on monday , rose to an estimated 3.5 points for august from 3.0 in july .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending their money , rather than saving it " after some economic institutes signalled an end to the economic downturn , the economic pessimism on the part of the consumers has also declined .
inflation is disappearing and people have more money in their pockets , " says the report .
inflation in germany had hit a record of zero percent in may , in june inflation stood at 0.1 percent .
analysts even predict falling prices for the coming summer months - a phenomenon not seen for more than 20 years .
at the same time , interest rates offered by banks are lower than they have been for years so that there 's little incentive for people to keep their money in the bank .
stable prices have managed to trigger consumer spending - especially on larger purchases like household appliances and home entertainment .
the government 's program in which it pays cash to people who scrap their old cars for new models has lead to a surge in automobile purchases .
rising unemployment threatens to reverse confidence another reason for the upbeat view of the country 's economic prospects is the fact that unemployment has not yet risen to the extent many had feared it would .
experts however warn of a sharp rise in unemployment in the months to come as soon as the global recession starts to catch up with germany 's labour market .
the assumption that the steep economic downturn has come to an end could therefore be premature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising unemployment in the autumn could dampen the optimism " the acid test for the consumer climate still lies ahead .
a long-lasting stabilisation of the consumer climate will depend on how the labor market develops in the future .
if the unemployment figures climb high in late autumn , this will be a test for consumer confidence , " the report says , adding that based on a long-term comparison , the consumer climate index is still at a very low level .
the gfk report comes only days after a report that german business confidence improved for the fourth consecutive month in july . on friday , the business climate index released by the institute for economic research -lrb- ifo -rrb- exceeded economists ' expectations by rising to 87.3 points after reaching a seven-month high in june of 85.9. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.07.2009 bulgarian parliament approves new government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borisov faces an uphill battle to curb corruption and get back in the eu 's favor bulgaria ’ s new prime minister , boiko borisov , was sworn in to office on monday , swearing to rein in systemic corruption and organized crime in hopes of convincing the eu his country should receive financial aid . three weeks following national elections in bulgaria , boiko borisov has been sworn in as the country 's new prime minister .
borisov 's center-right gerb party , which he founded , won 116 of the 240 seats in the elections held on july 5 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarians went to the polls earlier this month and gave borisov 's center-right gerb party 116 of 240 seats in his speech before the parliament , borisov , the former mayor of sofia , promised to rid the country of corruption and win back the trust of the european union , saying that the time had come to prove that bulgaria can implement reforms and reduce the deficit .
two and a half years after joining the eu , bulgaria has become something of an outcast .
the 27 member bloc cut its access to over 500 million euros -lrb- $ 713.2 million -rrb- in aid last year as punishment for fraud , and the eastern european nation is hoping to win back the trust of the eu and convince brussels to turn the flow of aid back on .
borisov promised that the new government would work under the principles of " openness and transparency " and admitted that this would not necessarily be an " easy path " to take .
failing to show results by the end of this year may threaten some of the 11 billion euros bulgaria has been promised in aid .
the rest of the lineup no prime minister can expect to accomplish anything without a well-rounded cabinet , and borisov is no different .
most of his ministers , which were quickly approved by parliament , are new on the political scene , which many see as part of borisov 's plan to prove his party is different from the traditional political establishment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new finance minister simeon djankov believes bulgaria will be able to join the eurozone within two years many experts have said that in light of the economic crisis , which has hit bulgaria especially hard , the new finance minister simeon djankov is going to play a vital role in the new government .
daniel smilov , program director of political and legal research at the center for liberal strategies in sofia , told deutsche welle that the appointment of djankov , who has joined borisov 's government after leaving a 13 year position at the world bank , is very significant .
" borisov wants to say that his economic policy is going to be stability and continuity of previous reforms and also increasing the deficit of the bulgarian economy , " he added .
smilov also pointed out that borisov 's closest ally , former police chief tsvetan tsvetanov , will head the interior ministery , making him responsible for cracking down on organized crime and fighting corruption among police .
the new minister of justice , margarita popova , has worked as a prosecutor since 1990 , heading the sofia prosecutor 's office between 1996 and 2004 before being appointed spokeswoman to the chief prosecutor boris velchev in 2006 .
since october of last year , popova has been running a specialized unit for fighting fraud involving eu funds and had won praise both at home in bulgaria and from brussels .
of course , having a good team is only half the battle , according to smilov , who says the real question is whether or not borisov has a coherent strategy to implement .
" now what is needed is real political commitment and will to change existing practices .
borisov has public support and he has a team of experts … so the conditions are there for some progress in the fight against corruption and organized crime .

head of the human fertilisation and embryology authority , professor lisa jardine , says proper payment may persuade more donors to come forward .
more and more british couples are going abroad for infertility treatment since the ban on payments was introduced .
the number of women using donated eggs and sperm fell by 25 % and 30 % respectively between 2004 and 2006 .
' patient welfare ' professor jardine told the times she felt a " responsibility " to look at the ban on selling donated eggs and sperm again .
my agenda is to try and keep assisted reproduction within our regulated area , not because i 'm bossy , but out of concern for patient welfare professor jardine she said payments may ease the shortage of stocks and keep more patients in britain to be treated in regulated clinics .
she said : " i 'm not saying the decision arrived at before i became chair was n't the right one at the time .
" but given the evidence that egg shortage is driving women overseas , i feel a responsibility to look at it again . "
professor jardine added : " my agenda is to try and keep assisted reproduction within our regulated area , not because i 'm bossy , but out of concern for patient welfare . "
she also said egg donors should be paid more than sperm donors to reflect the greater physical risks involved .
anonymity for sperm and egg donors was removed in 2005 - another factor thought to be behind the donor shortage .
the maximum any donor can receive in expenses is currently £ 250 .
professor jardine told the bbc a payment comparable to the cost of a cycle of ivf treatment - around £ 3,000 - might be more appropriate for women who donate eggs .
rewarding altruism professor jardine also wants a wider debate on the question of when family members should be allowed to donate to one another .
intergenerational donations have occurred , such as the case of a 72-year-old briton who provided sperm to his daughter-in-law .
most people in the profession would agree that donors should be paid more because it is a big commitment fertility expert dr allan pacey another issue is donation between siblings .
although it is generally accepted that sisters can give eggs to one another , professor jardine wants to consider whether a brother should be allowed to donate sperm to his sister if she is using a donated egg .
commenting on the payment concern , dr ainsley newson , a senior lecturer in biomedical ethics at bristol university , said the issue was around " reasonable compensation " for the burden of egg retrieval rather than paying for the eggs .
" increasing the capped amount that women are given for donating eggs may increase donation .
" it will also help to emphasise the altruism behind donation , not forgetting the importance of the gift being made . "
dr allan pacey , secretary of the british fertility society and a senior lecturer at the university of sheffield , said : " it 's good that we are having a debate about it .
" most people in the profession would agree that donors should be paid more because it is a big commitment , particularly egg donation . "
he said the difficulty was deciding the appropriate sum and how to square this with the " free " altruistic act of donation .

head of the human fertilisation and embryology authority , professor lisa jardine , says proper payment may persuade more donors to come forward .
more and more british couples are going abroad for infertility treatment since the ban on payments was introduced .
the number of women using donated eggs and sperm fell by 25 % and 30 % respectively between 2004 and 2006 .
' patient welfare ' professor jardine told the times she felt a " responsibility " to look at the ban on selling donated eggs and sperm again .
my agenda is to try and keep assisted reproduction within our regulated area , not because i 'm bossy , but out of concern for patient welfare professor jardine she said payments may ease the shortage of stocks and keep more patients in britain to be treated in regulated clinics .
she said : " i 'm not saying the decision arrived at before i became chair was n't the right one at the time .
" but given the evidence that egg shortage is driving women overseas , i feel a responsibility to look at it again . "
professor jardine added : " my agenda is to try and keep assisted reproduction within our regulated area , not because i 'm bossy , but out of concern for patient welfare . "
she also said egg donors should be paid more than sperm donors to reflect the greater physical risks involved .
anonymity for sperm and egg donors was removed in 2005 - another factor thought to be behind the donor shortage .
the maximum any donor can receive in expenses is currently £ 250 .
professor jardine told the bbc a payment comparable to the cost of a cycle of ivf treatment - around £ 3,000 - might be more appropriate for women who donate eggs .
rewarding altruism professor jardine also wants a wider debate on the question of when family members should be allowed to donate to one another .
intergenerational donations have occurred , such as the case of a 72-year-old briton who provided sperm to his daughter-in-law .
most people in the profession would agree that donors should be paid more because it is a big commitment fertility expert dr allan pacey another issue is donation between siblings .
although it is generally accepted that sisters can give eggs to one another , professor jardine wants to consider whether a brother should be allowed to donate sperm to his sister if she is using a donated egg .
commenting on the payment concern , dr ainsley newson , a senior lecturer in biomedical ethics at bristol university , said the issue was around " reasonable compensation " for the burden of egg retrieval rather than paying for the eggs .
" increasing the capped amount that women are given for donating eggs may increase donation .
" it will also help to emphasise the altruism behind donation , not forgetting the importance of the gift being made . "
dr allan pacey , secretary of the british fertility society and a senior lecturer at the university of sheffield , said : " it 's good that we are having a debate about it .
" most people in the profession would agree that donors should be paid more because it is a big commitment , particularly egg donation . "
he said the difficulty was deciding the appropriate sum and how to square this with the " free " altruistic act of donation .
bfs chairman tony rutherford said there would have to be a limit set on how many eggs a woman could safely donate .

head of the human fertilisation and embryology authority , professor lisa jardine , says proper payment may persuade more donors to come forward .
more and more british couples are going abroad for infertility treatment since the ban on payments was introduced .
the number of women using donated eggs and sperm fell by 25 % and 30 % respectively between 2004 and 2006 .
' patient welfare ' professor jardine told the times she felt a " responsibility " to look at the ban on selling donated eggs and sperm again .
my agenda is to try and keep assisted reproduction within our regulated area , not because i 'm bossy , but out of concern for patient welfare professor jardine she said payments may ease the shortage of stocks and keep more patients in britain to be treated in regulated clinics .
she said : " i 'm not saying the decision arrived at before i became chair was n't the right one at the time .
" but given the evidence that egg shortage is driving women overseas , i feel a responsibility to look at it again . "
professor jardine added : " my agenda is to try and keep assisted reproduction within our regulated area , not because i 'm bossy , but out of concern for patient welfare . "
she also said egg donors should be paid more than sperm donors to reflect the greater physical risks involved .
anonymity for sperm and egg donors was removed in 2005 - another factor thought to be behind the donor shortage .
the maximum any donor can receive in expenses is currently £ 250 .
professor jardine told the bbc a payment comparable to the cost of a cycle of ivf treatment - around £ 3,000 - might be more appropriate for women who donate eggs .
rewarding altruism professor jardine also wants a wider debate on the question of when family members should be allowed to donate to one another .
intergenerational donations have occurred , such as the case of a 72-year-old briton who provided sperm to his daughter-in-law .
most people in the profession would agree that donors should be paid more because it is a big commitment fertility expert dr allan pacey another issue is donation between siblings .
although it is generally accepted that sisters can give eggs to one another , professor jardine wants to consider whether a brother should be allowed to donate sperm to his sister if she is using a donated egg .
commenting on the payment concern , dr ainsley newson , a senior lecturer in biomedical ethics at bristol university , said the issue was around " reasonable compensation " for the burden of egg retrieval rather than paying for the eggs .
" increasing the capped amount that women are given for donating eggs may increase donation .
" it will also help to emphasise the altruism behind donation , not forgetting the importance of the gift being made . "

a reduced tram service is running from hucknall to the city centre .
some services are being replaced by buses .
talks between the gmb union and operator nottingham tram consortium -lrb- ntc -rrb- failed to reach an agreement .
the gmb union had called for a 5 % pay increase but nottingham tram consortium -lrb- ntc -rrb- refused because it faces a drop in its annual income .
the gmb union said 89.8 % of its 134 members had voted in a favour of a walkout and warned that more strike action could follow .
helen goulding , general manager for ntc , said she was " very disappointed " they had been unable to reach agreement to avoid the gmb 's industrial action , and apologised to customers for the disruption caused .
she added : " i remain committed to finding a satisfactory solution that meets the needs of all involved to avoid further strike action . "
the strike is due to end at 0525 bst on tuesday .

baroness ford said she and olympics minister tessa jowell accepted that the olympic park in stratford , east london , must be left with a world-class athletics venue after 2012 .
in her first television interview since taking office , baroness ford said : " it is cast in stone that we leave a grand prix athletics stadium .
" but what i have opened the book around is the other kind of value we can add to this stadium .
' knockout destination ' " if we won the world cup bid , that would be one reason to keep the stadium at a particular capacity .
" tessa and i agree that it is more important that we have a stadium built as an attraction .
" whether it 's 80,000 , 50,000 or 25,000 seats after the games is a kind of second question . "
i have learned that there is increasing support for the stadium to be proposed as a ground for semi-final matches in 2018 .
i think it will become a bit like central park in new york - beloved of new yorkers but also a fantastic magnet for visitors to the city baroness ford that would mean it would stay at 80,000 so it could stage matches at the decisive end of the tournament .
so far everybody has assumed that the top tiers of the stadium , which have already been built , are coming straight down after 2012 .
now that 's not so sure .
baroness ford , who played a key role in helping to transform the dome from a white elephant into the successful 02 arena , said the olympic park must be used by both the local community and tourists every day after 2012 .
she also hopes it will host a permanent olympics exhibition .
" we have to create a real knockout destination .
" underneath the stadium we can create a fantastic visitor attraction for londoners and tourists - perhaps a permanent olympic museum with good interactive attractions .
" we can have a sporting hall of fame .
" there are lots of organisations which want to come and locate themselves in the park .
there will be sporting , cultural and community events there .
" i think it will become a bit like central park in new york - beloved of new yorkers but also a fantastic magnet for visitors to the city . "
' no dome mistake ' baroness ford has said she plans to carry out a full review of the stadium plans in the next five months .
the new company in charge of the legacy of 2012 is due to make a decision on the stadium 's future by the end of the year .
although the legacy company will control the park , baroness ford hopes to persuade private firms to take over the running of the individual venues .
the lea valley park authority has already agreed to run the yet-to-be-built velodrome in stratford and the white-water canoeing centre at broxbourne in hertfordshire .
the o2 arena has become a major venue for music concerts " my objective is not to go to london or the government cap in hand and say we need lots of subsidy to make all of this work , " baroness ford added .
" i happen to think there is a clear market need for a knockout sports visitor attraction in the uk and that we will able to find the right kind of operators , as we did with the dome . "
asked if that would be tough in a recession , she said : " if we were going looking for investors tomorrow , i would really have a problem .
" but by the time i come to commit to all of these things , four years from now , i think we expect to be in a different place . "
baroness ford said it was crucial that olympic chiefs did not repeat the mistakes made with the dome at the start of the decade .
she said : " my company has three years to think about planning of events , getting the right tenants and getting the visitor attractions up and running so we are not left with a situation , as we were with the dome , where it was empty , derelict and desolate .
" we will avoid that . "
