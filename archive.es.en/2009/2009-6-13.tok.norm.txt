his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .
protestors set fires and threw rocks at police .
cell phone service was cut off in the capital .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently all the voting shares are held by the porsche and piech families .
der spiegel news magazine says that a " firm majority " within the families approved , overruling ferdinand piech , who is also chairman of the volkswagen supervisory board .
he has advocated absorption of porsche into the vw group .
der spiegel said piech 's personal shareholding in porsche was not sufficient to block the takeover , and his brother , hans michel piech , was on the side of the rest of the porsche family on the issue .
the media reports suggest that a takeover agreement might be in place by the end of june .
analysts say an investment by the qia would considerably strengthen porsche 's clout in its merger talks with volkswagen , potentially putting it back in the driving seat in the saga surrounding europe 's largest carmaker. ad / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "

“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .

canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”

but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .

and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”

“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .

he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .

iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .

earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .
protestors set fires and threw rocks at police .
cell phone service was cut off in the capital .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently all the voting shares are held by the porsche and piech families .
der spiegel news magazine says that a " firm majority " within the families approved , overruling ferdinand piech , who is also chairman of the volkswagen supervisory board .
he has advocated absorption of porsche into the vw group .
der spiegel said piech 's personal shareholding in porsche was not sufficient to block the takeover , and his brother , hans michel piech , was on the side of the rest of the porsche family on the issue .
the media reports suggest that a takeover agreement might be in place by the end of june .

in a communique they noted that they had taken " forceful and coordinated " steps to stabilize the the financial sector but that significant risks remained .
" there are signs of stabilisation in our economies , including a recovery of stock markets , a decline in interest rate spreads , improved business and consumer confidence , " the statement noted . the communique went on to say that the g8 nations will continue to work with others to put the global economy on a strong and sustainable growth path .
but that they still had to be cautious .
" we must remain vigilant to ensure that consumer and investor confidence is fully restored and that growth is underpinned by stable financial markets and strong fundamentals , " they said .
the group also pledged that there would be more stimulus if needed .
differences revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister disagrees with us position the meeting did expose differences among the participants .
germany urged governments to scale back the deficits incurred when governments increased spending during the crisis , while the us government urged everyone to stay the course .
in another display of differences , the us and canada have been urging the europeans to subject their banks to us style " stress tests , " but berlin said that that could undermine confidence in the recovery .
however all the finance chiefs did agree that they would have to start looking at ways to unwind the stimulus packages and german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that he agreed with the international monetary fund that it was important to develop credible exit strategies .
" this means we must now think about how we 'll go about it once we are getting out of this hole , this valley , " said steinbrueck , adding that this applied to monetary as well as fiscal policy and also to the banking sector rescue efforts .
france warns to remain cautious the french also urged caution on exiting the steps taken to aide in the global economic recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde , urges caution " we should n't get carried away with the recovery while we 're still relaunching , stimulating and ensuring that our recovery plans work , " said french finance minister christine lagarde on friday .
" we must be very prudent because the shock was extremely brutal , " she added .
the other topics discussed at the meeting were regulatory reform in the g8 nations , further transparency in financial transactions , money laundering and the global financing of terrorism .
adding to the uncertainty , three of the world 's major financial institutions have differing views on the future of the global economy . the world bank says the crisis in 2009 will be worse than expected , while the international monetary fund has upped its forecast for global growth in 2010 to 2.4 percent and the wto says there are no signs of a trade recovery yet .

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 13.06.2009 german military draws on expertise from female muslim soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are making their mark in the bundeswehr since the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , opened its doors to women in 2001 , their ranks have grown to a modest , yet proud seven percent .
but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”
all applications welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr says recruits from all backgrounds are welcome amidst a climate of falling birth rates , lieutenant colonel juergen amman of the north rhine-westphalia state command said he welcomes the increase in applications from germans of foreign extraction .
“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .
“ your qualities have to trump those of the others , and when you are performing in front of male colleagues , you ca n't just give 100 percent , you have to give 200 or sometimes even 300 percent .

in a communique they noted that they had taken " forceful and coordinated " steps to stabilize the the financial sector but that significant risks remained .
" there are signs of stabilisation in our economies , including a recovery of stock markets , a decline in interest rate spreads , improved business and consumer confidence , " the statement noted . the communique went on to say that the g8 nations will continue to work with others to put the global economy on a strong and sustainable growth path .
but that they still had to be cautious .
" we must remain vigilant to ensure that consumer and investor confidence is fully restored and that growth is underpinned by stable financial markets and strong fundamentals , " they said .
the group also pledged that there would be more stimulus if needed .
differences revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister disagrees with us position the meeting did expose differences among the participants .
germany urged governments to scale back the deficits incurred when governments increased spending during the crisis , while the us government urged everyone to stay the course .
in another display of differences , the us and canada have been urging the europeans to subject their banks to us style " stress tests , " but berlin said that that could undermine confidence in the recovery .
however all the finance chiefs did agree that they would have to start looking at ways to unwind the stimulus packages and german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that he agreed with the international monetary fund that it was important to develop credible exit strategies .
" this means we must now think about how we 'll go about it once we are getting out of this hole , this valley , " said steinbrueck , adding that this applied to monetary as well as fiscal policy and also to the banking sector rescue efforts .
france warns to remain cautious the french also urged caution on exiting the steps taken to aide in the global economic recovery .

" we must be very prudent because the shock was extremely brutal , " she added .
the other topics discussed at the meeting were regulatory reform in the g8 nations , further transparency in financial transactions , money laundering and the global financing of terrorism .
adding to the uncertainty , three of the world 's major financial institutions have differing views on the future of the global economy . the world bank says the crisis in 2009 will be worse than expected , while the international monetary fund has upped its forecast for global growth in 2010 to 2.4 percent and the wto says there are no signs of a trade recovery yet .

currently all the voting shares are held by the porsche and piech families .
der spiegel news magazine says that a " firm majority " within the families approved , overruling ferdinand piech , who is also chairman of the volkswagen supervisory board .
he has advocated absorption of porsche into the vw group .
der spiegel said piech 's personal shareholding in porsche was not sufficient to block the takeover , and his brother , hans michel piech , was on the side of the rest of the porsche family on the issue .
the media reports suggest that a takeover agreement might be in place by the end of june .
analysts say an investment by the qia would considerably strengthen porsche 's clout in its merger talks with volkswagen , potentially putting it back in the driving seat in the saga surrounding europe 's largest carmaker. ad / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 13.06.2009 german military draws on expertise from female muslim soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are making their mark in the bundeswehr since the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , opened its doors to women in 2001 , their ranks have grown to a modest , yet proud seven percent .
but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”
all applications welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr says recruits from all backgrounds are welcome amidst a climate of falling birth rates , lieutenant colonel juergen amman of the north rhine-westphalia state command said he welcomes the increase in applications from germans of foreign extraction .
“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .
“ your qualities have to trump those of the others , and when you are performing in front of male colleagues , you ca n't just give 100 percent , you have to give 200 or sometimes even 300 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 13.06.2009 german military draws on expertise from female muslim soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are making their mark in the bundeswehr since the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , opened its doors to women in 2001 , their ranks have grown to a modest , yet proud seven percent .
but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”
all applications welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr says recruits from all backgrounds are welcome amidst a climate of falling birth rates , lieutenant colonel juergen amman of the north rhine-westphalia state command said he welcomes the increase in applications from germans of foreign extraction .
“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .
“ your qualities have to trump those of the others , and when you are performing in front of male colleagues , you ca n't just give 100 percent , you have to give 200 or sometimes even 300 percent .

in a communique they noted that they had taken " forceful and coordinated " steps to stabilize the the financial sector but that significant risks remained .
" there are signs of stabilisation in our economies , including a recovery of stock markets , a decline in interest rate spreads , improved business and consumer confidence , " the statement noted . the communique went on to say that the g8 nations will continue to work with others to put the global economy on a strong and sustainable growth path .
but that they still had to be cautious .
" we must remain vigilant to ensure that consumer and investor confidence is fully restored and that growth is underpinned by stable financial markets and strong fundamentals , " they said .
the group also pledged that there would be more stimulus if needed .
differences revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister disagrees with us position the meeting did expose differences among the participants .
germany urged governments to scale back the deficits incurred when governments increased spending during the crisis , while the us government urged everyone to stay the course .
in another display of differences , the us and canada have been urging the europeans to subject their banks to us style " stress tests , " but berlin said that that could undermine confidence in the recovery .
however all the finance chiefs did agree that they would have to start looking at ways to unwind the stimulus packages and german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that he agreed with the international monetary fund that it was important to develop credible exit strategies .
" this means we must now think about how we 'll go about it once we are getting out of this hole , this valley , " said steinbrueck , adding that this applied to monetary as well as fiscal policy and also to the banking sector rescue efforts .
france warns to remain cautious the french also urged caution on exiting the steps taken to aide in the global economic recovery .

" we must be very prudent because the shock was extremely brutal , " she added .
the other topics discussed at the meeting were regulatory reform in the g8 nations , further transparency in financial transactions , money laundering and the global financing of terrorism .
adding to the uncertainty , three of the world 's major financial institutions have differing views on the future of the global economy . the world bank says the crisis in 2009 will be worse than expected , while the international monetary fund has upped its forecast for global growth in 2010 to 2.4 percent and the wto says there are no signs of a trade recovery yet .

" there are signs of stabilisation in our economies , including a recovery of stock markets , a decline in interest rate spreads , improved business and consumer confidence , " the statement noted . the communique went on to say that the g8 nations will continue to work with others to put the global economy on a strong and sustainable growth path .
but that they still had to be cautious .
" we must remain vigilant to ensure that consumer and investor confidence is fully restored and that growth is underpinned by stable financial markets and strong fundamentals , " they said .
the group also pledged that there would be more stimulus if needed .
differences revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister disagrees with us position the meeting did expose differences among the participants .
germany urged governments to scale back the deficits incurred when governments increased spending during the crisis , while the us government urged everyone to stay the course .
in another display of differences , the us and canada have been urging the europeans to subject their banks to us style " stress tests , " but berlin said that that could undermine confidence in the recovery .
however all the finance chiefs did agree that they would have to start looking at ways to unwind the stimulus packages and german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that he agreed with the international monetary fund that it was important to develop credible exit strategies .
" this means we must now think about how we 'll go about it once we are getting out of this hole , this valley , " said steinbrueck , adding that this applied to monetary as well as fiscal policy and also to the banking sector rescue efforts .
france warns to remain cautious the french also urged caution on exiting the steps taken to aide in the global economic recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde , urges caution " we should n't get carried away with the recovery while we 're still relaunching , stimulating and ensuring that our recovery plans work , " said french finance minister christine lagarde on friday .
" we must be very prudent because the shock was extremely brutal , " she added .
the other topics discussed at the meeting were regulatory reform in the g8 nations , further transparency in financial transactions , money laundering and the global financing of terrorism .
adding to the uncertainty , three of the world 's major financial institutions have differing views on the future of the global economy . the world bank says the crisis in 2009 will be worse than expected , while the international monetary fund has upped its forecast for global growth in 2010 to 2.4 percent and the wto says there are no signs of a trade recovery yet .

his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .

iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .

in a communique they noted that they had taken " forceful and coordinated " steps to stabilize the the financial sector but that significant risks remained .
" there are signs of stabilisation in our economies , including a recovery of stock markets , a decline in interest rate spreads , improved business and consumer confidence , " the statement noted . the communique went on to say that the g8 nations will continue to work with others to put the global economy on a strong and sustainable growth path .
but that they still had to be cautious .
" we must remain vigilant to ensure that consumer and investor confidence is fully restored and that growth is underpinned by stable financial markets and strong fundamentals , " they said .
the group also pledged that there would be more stimulus if needed .
differences revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister disagrees with us position the meeting did expose differences among the participants .
germany urged governments to scale back the deficits incurred when governments increased spending during the crisis , while the us government urged everyone to stay the course .
in another display of differences , the us and canada have been urging the europeans to subject their banks to us style " stress tests , " but berlin said that that could undermine confidence in the recovery .
however all the finance chiefs did agree that they would have to start looking at ways to unwind the stimulus packages and german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that he agreed with the international monetary fund that it was important to develop credible exit strategies .
" this means we must now think about how we 'll go about it once we are getting out of this hole , this valley , " said steinbrueck , adding that this applied to monetary as well as fiscal policy and also to the banking sector rescue efforts .
france warns to remain cautious the french also urged caution on exiting the steps taken to aide in the global economic recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde , urges caution " we should n't get carried away with the recovery while we 're still relaunching , stimulating and ensuring that our recovery plans work , " said french finance minister christine lagarde on friday .
" we must be very prudent because the shock was extremely brutal , " she added .
the other topics discussed at the meeting were regulatory reform in the g8 nations , further transparency in financial transactions , money laundering and the global financing of terrorism .
adding to the uncertainty , three of the world 's major financial institutions have differing views on the future of the global economy . the world bank says the crisis in 2009 will be worse than expected , while the international monetary fund has upped its forecast for global growth in 2010 to 2.4 percent and the wto says there are no signs of a trade recovery yet .

but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”

and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”
all applications welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr says recruits from all backgrounds are welcome amidst a climate of falling birth rates , lieutenant colonel juergen amman of the north rhine-westphalia state command said he welcomes the increase in applications from germans of foreign extraction .
“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .

but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .

his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .
protestors set fires and threw rocks at police .
cell phone service was cut off in the capital .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .

but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”
all applications welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr says recruits from all backgrounds are welcome amidst a climate of falling birth rates , lieutenant colonel juergen amman of the north rhine-westphalia state command said he welcomes the increase in applications from germans of foreign extraction .
“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .
“ your qualities have to trump those of the others , and when you are performing in front of male colleagues , you ca n't just give 100 percent , you have to give 200 or sometimes even 300 percent .

but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”
all applications welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr says recruits from all backgrounds are welcome amidst a climate of falling birth rates , lieutenant colonel juergen amman of the north rhine-westphalia state command said he welcomes the increase in applications from germans of foreign extraction .
“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .
“ your qualities have to trump those of the others , and when you are performing in front of male colleagues , you ca n't just give 100 percent , you have to give 200 or sometimes even 300 percent .

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”
all applications welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr says recruits from all backgrounds are welcome amidst a climate of falling birth rates , lieutenant colonel juergen amman of the north rhine-westphalia state command said he welcomes the increase in applications from germans of foreign extraction .
“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .
“ your qualities have to trump those of the others , and when you are performing in front of male colleagues , you ca n't just give 100 percent , you have to give 200 or sometimes even 300 percent .

his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .
protestors set fires and threw rocks at police .
cell phone service was cut off in the capital .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a communique they noted that they had taken " forceful and coordinated " steps to stabilize the the financial sector but that significant risks remained .
" there are signs of stabilisation in our economies , including a recovery of stock markets , a decline in interest rate spreads , improved business and consumer confidence , " the statement noted . the communique went on to say that the g8 nations will continue to work with others to put the global economy on a strong and sustainable growth path .
but that they still had to be cautious .
" we must remain vigilant to ensure that consumer and investor confidence is fully restored and that growth is underpinned by stable financial markets and strong fundamentals , " they said .
the group also pledged that there would be more stimulus if needed .
differences revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister disagrees with us position the meeting did expose differences among the participants .
germany urged governments to scale back the deficits incurred when governments increased spending during the crisis , while the us government urged everyone to stay the course .
in another display of differences , the us and canada have been urging the europeans to subject their banks to us style " stress tests , " but berlin said that that could undermine confidence in the recovery .
however all the finance chiefs did agree that they would have to start looking at ways to unwind the stimulus packages and german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that he agreed with the international monetary fund that it was important to develop credible exit strategies .
" this means we must now think about how we 'll go about it once we are getting out of this hole , this valley , " said steinbrueck , adding that this applied to monetary as well as fiscal policy and also to the banking sector rescue efforts .
france warns to remain cautious the french also urged caution on exiting the steps taken to aide in the global economic recovery .

" we must be very prudent because the shock was extremely brutal , " she added .
the other topics discussed at the meeting were regulatory reform in the g8 nations , further transparency in financial transactions , money laundering and the global financing of terrorism .
adding to the uncertainty , three of the world 's major financial institutions have differing views on the future of the global economy . the world bank says the crisis in 2009 will be worse than expected , while the international monetary fund has upped its forecast for global growth in 2010 to 2.4 percent and the wto says there are no signs of a trade recovery yet .

but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .

opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”

“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .

in a communique they noted that they had taken " forceful and coordinated " steps to stabilize the the financial sector but that significant risks remained .
" there are signs of stabilisation in our economies , including a recovery of stock markets , a decline in interest rate spreads , improved business and consumer confidence , " the statement noted . the communique went on to say that the g8 nations will continue to work with others to put the global economy on a strong and sustainable growth path .
but that they still had to be cautious .
" we must remain vigilant to ensure that consumer and investor confidence is fully restored and that growth is underpinned by stable financial markets and strong fundamentals , " they said .
the group also pledged that there would be more stimulus if needed .
differences revealed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister disagrees with us position the meeting did expose differences among the participants .
germany urged governments to scale back the deficits incurred when governments increased spending during the crisis , while the us government urged everyone to stay the course .
in another display of differences , the us and canada have been urging the europeans to subject their banks to us style " stress tests , " but berlin said that that could undermine confidence in the recovery .
however all the finance chiefs did agree that they would have to start looking at ways to unwind the stimulus packages and german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that he agreed with the international monetary fund that it was important to develop credible exit strategies .
" this means we must now think about how we 'll go about it once we are getting out of this hole , this valley , " said steinbrueck , adding that this applied to monetary as well as fiscal policy and also to the banking sector rescue efforts .
france warns to remain cautious the french also urged caution on exiting the steps taken to aide in the global economic recovery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister christine lagarde , urges caution " we should n't get carried away with the recovery while we 're still relaunching , stimulating and ensuring that our recovery plans work , " said french finance minister christine lagarde on friday .
" we must be very prudent because the shock was extremely brutal , " she added .
the other topics discussed at the meeting were regulatory reform in the g8 nations , further transparency in financial transactions , money laundering and the global financing of terrorism .
adding to the uncertainty , three of the world 's major financial institutions have differing views on the future of the global economy . the world bank says the crisis in 2009 will be worse than expected , while the international monetary fund has upped its forecast for global growth in 2010 to 2.4 percent and the wto says there are no signs of a trade recovery yet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 13.06.2009 german military draws on expertise from female muslim soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are making their mark in the bundeswehr since the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , opened its doors to women in 2001 , their ranks have grown to a modest , yet proud seven percent .
but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”
all applications welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr says recruits from all backgrounds are welcome amidst a climate of falling birth rates , lieutenant colonel juergen amman of the north rhine-westphalia state command said he welcomes the increase in applications from germans of foreign extraction .
“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .
“ your qualities have to trump those of the others , and when you are performing in front of male colleagues , you ca n't just give 100 percent , you have to give 200 or sometimes even 300 percent .

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .
protestors set fires and threw rocks at police .
cell phone service was cut off in the capital .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .

but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”

his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .
protestors set fires and threw rocks at police .
cell phone service was cut off in the capital .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to initial reports , the ship is a german-owned vessel , however , the german foreign ministry has not confirmed this .
" i can confirm a ship , the mv charelle , has been hijacked friday afternoon inside oman 's territorial waters " , said commander chris davies , nato 's maritime spokesman .
" this is the first noted case of armed robbery in oman 's territorial waters , outside the normal area where the pirates are operating .
it 's quite unusual , " he said .
" the ship is now heading south towards somalia . "
no information has been released about the ship 's crew .
nato officials said this was the first case of piracy outside the normal operations area of pirates .

his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .
protestors set fires and threw rocks at police .
cell phone service was cut off in the capital .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .
protestors set fires and threw rocks at police .
cell phone service was cut off in the capital .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 13.06.2009 german military draws on expertise from female muslim soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are making their mark in the bundeswehr since the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , opened its doors to women in 2001 , their ranks have grown to a modest , yet proud seven percent .
but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”
all applications welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr says recruits from all backgrounds are welcome amidst a climate of falling birth rates , lieutenant colonel juergen amman of the north rhine-westphalia state command said he welcomes the increase in applications from germans of foreign extraction .
“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .
“ your qualities have to trump those of the others , and when you are performing in front of male colleagues , you ca n't just give 100 percent , you have to give 200 or sometimes even 300 percent .

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a communique they noted that they had taken " forceful and coordinated " steps to stabilize the the financial sector but that significant risks remained .
" there are signs of stabilisation in our economies , including a recovery of stock markets , a decline in interest rate spreads , improved business and consumer confidence , " the statement noted . the communique went on to say that the g8 nations will continue to work with others to put the global economy on a strong and sustainable growth path .

" we must remain vigilant to ensure that consumer and investor confidence is fully restored and that growth is underpinned by stable financial markets and strong fundamentals , " they said .

" this means we must now think about how we 'll go about it once we are getting out of this hole , this valley , " said steinbrueck , adding that this applied to monetary as well as fiscal policy and also to the banking sector rescue efforts .

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .

iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .

iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”
all applications welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr says recruits from all backgrounds are welcome amidst a climate of falling birth rates , lieutenant colonel juergen amman of the north rhine-westphalia state command said he welcomes the increase in applications from germans of foreign extraction .
“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .
“ your qualities have to trump those of the others , and when you are performing in front of male colleagues , you ca n't just give 100 percent , you have to give 200 or sometimes even 300 percent .

his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .
protestors set fires and threw rocks at police .
cell phone service was cut off in the capital .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”
all applications welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr says recruits from all backgrounds are welcome amidst a climate of falling birth rates , lieutenant colonel juergen amman of the north rhine-westphalia state command said he welcomes the increase in applications from germans of foreign extraction .
“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .
“ your qualities have to trump those of the others , and when you are performing in front of male colleagues , you ca n't just give 100 percent , you have to give 200 or sometimes even 300 percent .

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .

iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a communique they noted that they had taken " forceful and coordinated " steps to stabilize the the financial sector but that significant risks remained .
" there are signs of stabilisation in our economies , including a recovery of stock markets , a decline in interest rate spreads , improved business and consumer confidence , " the statement noted . the communique went on to say that the g8 nations will continue to work with others to put the global economy on a strong and sustainable growth path .
but that they still had to be cautious .
" we must remain vigilant to ensure that consumer and investor confidence is fully restored and that growth is underpinned by stable financial markets and strong fundamentals , " they said .
the group also pledged that there would be more stimulus if needed .

in another display of differences , the us and canada have been urging the europeans to subject their banks to us style " stress tests , " but berlin said that that could undermine confidence in the recovery .
however all the finance chiefs did agree that they would have to start looking at ways to unwind the stimulus packages and german finance minister peer steinbrueck said that he agreed with the international monetary fund that it was important to develop credible exit strategies .
" this means we must now think about how we 'll go about it once we are getting out of this hole , this valley , " said steinbrueck , adding that this applied to monetary as well as fiscal policy and also to the banking sector rescue efforts .

adding to the uncertainty , three of the world 's major financial institutions have differing views on the future of the global economy . the world bank says the crisis in 2009 will be worse than expected , while the international monetary fund has upped its forecast for global growth in 2010 to 2.4 percent and the wto says there are no signs of a trade recovery yet .

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently all the voting shares are held by the porsche and piech families .
der spiegel news magazine says that a " firm majority " within the families approved , overruling ferdinand piech , who is also chairman of the volkswagen supervisory board .
he has advocated absorption of porsche into the vw group .
der spiegel said piech 's personal shareholding in porsche was not sufficient to block the takeover , and his brother , hans michel piech , was on the side of the rest of the porsche family on the issue .
the media reports suggest that a takeover agreement might be in place by the end of june .
analysts say an investment by the qia would considerably strengthen porsche 's clout in its merger talks with volkswagen , potentially putting it back in the driving seat in the saga surrounding europe 's largest carmaker. ad / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the official kcna news agency quoted an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the north would restart its uranium enrichment program and weaponize all of its plutonium in response to the un punishment for an april nuclear test .
the spokesman added that the north had " reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods " .
pyongyang also threatened military action if the united states and its allies tried to isolate it .
on friday , the security council approved a resolution banning all weapons exports from north korea and most arms imports into the state .
it authorized un member states to inspect north korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy goods shipped that violate the sanctions .
experts said the north does not have the technology or the resources to build one of the costly reactors but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
north korea 's soviet-era yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now-stalled disarmament-for-aid deal among pyongyang and five regional powers .
the spent fuel rods cooling at yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb 's worth of fissile material , according to some experts .
the april rocket launch by pyongyang was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test .
for years , north korean officials under the leadership of kim jong il have used military threats to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay pyongyang for taking steps to decrease security threats and regional risks. rb / mrm / reuters / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his rival mousavi has alleged widespread irregularities in the polls . former prime minister mir hossein mousavi has urged senior iranian clerics to speak out against iran 's " rigged " election .
he warned that polling violations would lead to tyranny .
thousands of mousavi supporters clashed with police in the aftermath of iran 's election . they staged a sit-in at tehran 's vanak square .
protestors set fires and threw rocks at police .
cell phone service was cut off in the capital .
iranian election officials said on saturday that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won the election by a clear majority , getting twice as many votes as his closest challenger mir hossein mousavi .
with almost all the votes counted , the islamic republic 's election commission said ahmadinejad had won more than 63 percent of votes against 34.7 percent for mousavi .
it put the voter turnout at around 80 percent of 46 million eligible voters .
voting deadlines were extended several times on friday to cope with long lines .
analysts had expected the vote to be a tight race between the hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad and the reformist mousavi .
ahmadinejad , seeking his second term in office , won most of his votes from the rural heartland .
main challenger alleges voting irregularities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad celebrates his victory mousavi in a written statement on his website appealed to clerics and branded the work of electoral officials and state television as a " charade . " " what we have seen from dishonest officials will result in shaking the pillars of the islamic republic system , and a dominace of lying and tyranny , " said the satement .
earlier , at a press conference , mousavi said many people had not been able to vote and that there had been a lack of ballot papers .
he also accused the authorities of blocking text messaging , which his campaign has used to reach young , urban voters .
reactions from abroad in canada , foreign minister lawrence cannon said he was " deeply concerned " about reports of voting irregularities in the election .
us secretary of state hillary clinton in washington said she hoped that the results reflected the " genuine will and desire " of the people .
ahmadinejad assumed power four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 islamic revolution .
he quickly drew international condemnation after refusing to halt iran 's nuclear programme , rejecting western charges that it was aimed at building an atomic bomb .
he also denied the holocaust and called for israel to be wiped from the map. nrt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 13.06.2009 german military draws on expertise from female muslim soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are making their mark in the bundeswehr since the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , opened its doors to women in 2001 , their ranks have grown to a modest , yet proud seven percent .
but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .
religious concessions on the whole it seems as though the bundeswehr is taking the necessary steps to incorporate the religious requirements of its members .
canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”
all applications welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr says recruits from all backgrounds are welcome amidst a climate of falling birth rates , lieutenant colonel juergen amman of the north rhine-westphalia state command said he welcomes the increase in applications from germans of foreign extraction .
“ the bundeswehr is open .
and if young muslim men and women apply to sign up , they are informed and advised and put through a test procedure , ” he said .
and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .
but that , said narima , is sometimes just a little bit harder to pull off when you happen to be a woman .
“ your qualities have to trump those of the others , and when you are performing in front of male colleagues , you ca n't just give 100 percent , you have to give 200 or sometimes even 300 percent .

currently all the voting shares are held by the porsche and piech families .
der spiegel news magazine says that a " firm majority " within the families approved , overruling ferdinand piech , who is also chairman of the volkswagen supervisory board .
he has advocated absorption of porsche into the vw group .
der spiegel said piech 's personal shareholding in porsche was not sufficient to block the takeover , and his brother , hans michel piech , was on the side of the rest of the porsche family on the issue .
the media reports suggest that a takeover agreement might be in place by the end of june .
analysts say an investment by the qia would considerably strengthen porsche 's clout in its merger talks with volkswagen , potentially putting it back in the driving seat in the saga surrounding europe 's largest carmaker. ad / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but of the 13,000-strong female force , very few are muslims . staff sergeant narima h. speaks five languages , wears a uniform , takes part in dangerous foreign missions and believes in allah .
and as a woman of islamic faith , the 29-year-old is precisely the kind of asset the bundeswehr needs when trying to bridge the cultural gaps that the security of its soldiers and the success of its operation depend on .
at present , the bundeswehr is almost exclusively active in countries where the majority of the population is muslim , and narima 's next mission is no exception .
she is currently preparing for another deployment to afghanistan .
“ i am learning dari , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ my company is based in kundus and that is one of the languages spoken in afghanistan - specifically northern afghanistan . "
the trip will be her fourth foreign assignment .
" if we have migrants from countries where we are on a mission , we can learn a lot , ” said lieutenant colonel ulrich kirsch of the federal armed forces association .
“ we can draw on their intercultural expertise . ”
opening doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shared religious background can open local doors although narima h. does not come from afghanistan - she is of moroccan descent but was born and raised in germany - she shares her belief in allah with the majority of the population in hindu kush .
and that mutual faith has already proved useful in dealing with local people .
“ i was in kundus in afghanistan last year and it was quite easy for me to communicate with people there , especially with afghani women , ” the young soldier said , adding that as soon as they realized she was muslim , they opened doors for her .
currently , there are some one thousand muslims in the bundeswehr , but changing demographics mean there is likely to be an increase of muslims , both male and female , signing up to serve .
there are some concerns than a rise in muslim recruits could lead to problems with the current dress code .
but narima does n't see a conflict .
“ if it makes tactical or military sense for me to wear a headscarf , i 'll wear one , and none of my superiors will tell me it 's wrong , ” she said .

canteens offer pork-free meals and special rooms are provided for daily prayer rituals .
the bundeswehr is even careful not to conscript during the month of ramadan , when muslims are not allowed to eat or drink until after sunset .
before narima became a staff sergeant , she took a training course which was scheduled during the month of fasting .
but she found a way around what could have become a real physical problem .
" the religion allows some exceptions to the fasting rule , ” she said , “ because it is not possible to endure such physical exertion with nothing to eat or drink . ”

and once they have made it to the other side of all that , and are installed in their barracks , the new recruits have to set about earning the respect of their comrades .

it is one of the world 's worst per capita emitters of greenhouse gases .
' strong grip ' protesters were urged to wear red to highlight the risks of global warming .
in sydney , rally organiser moira williams said that a coalition of trade unions and religious groups , as well as students and environmental campaigners , was pushing for immediate action .
" we need to be making these alliances and be stronger than the fossil fuel industry that currently has such a strong grip on climate policy in australia .
" that is the positive in this rally and in this year - that we need to build that movement and it does need to come from the ground up , because at the moment we are not seeing any action from the top down . "
scientists have warned that australia is particularly vulnerable to the effects of a shifting climate .
as temperatures increase , there are predictions that coastal communities will be threatened by rising sea levels , while other parts of the country could suffer more severe droughts , cyclones and bushfires .
the government in canberra has repeatedly stressed that tackling climate change is a priority .

her decision to quit as communities secretary , on the eve of the english council and european elections last week , has been widely criticised .
she has told the manchester evening news she regretted the timing of her departure and its effect on the party .
labour mp frank field later said he hoped her apology would be accepted and she would return to high office .
labour crashed to its lowest share of the vote at the european elections and lost control of four key councils .
constituency sources have told the bbc it is unlikely the no confidence motion will succeed as she has the backing of her local party leadership .
but if the motion , which is understood to be backed by a number of local party branches , did succeed it would step up pressure on her to be deselected .
' enormous ' regret in an interview with the manchester evening news , ms blears - mp for salford - said she regretted " enormously " the timing of her resignation - on the eve of the elections and after it emerged jacqui smith , the home secretary , was stepping down . "
it was a stupid thing to do in retrospect but it was just putting a brave face on " hazel blears on her ' rocking the boat ' badge blears : my resignation ' regrets ' " i genuinely thought i could go without it sparking off this huge firestorm , " she said .
" in hindsight that judgment was wrong .

hazel blears regrets her timing - courtesy manchester evening news hazel blears will face a motion of no confidence next week at a meeting of her constituency labour party .
her decision to quit as communities secretary , on the eve of the english council and european elections last week , has been widely criticised .
she has told the manchester evening news she regretted the timing of her departure and its effect on the party .
labour mp frank field later said he hoped her apology would be accepted and she would return to high office .
labour crashed to its lowest share of the vote at the european elections and lost control of four key councils .
constituency sources have told the bbc it is unlikely the no confidence motion will succeed as she has the backing of her local party leadership .
but if the motion , which is understood to be backed by a number of local party branches , did succeed it would step up pressure on her to be deselected .
' enormous ' regret in an interview with the manchester evening news , ms blears - mp for salford - said she regretted " enormously " the timing of her resignation - on the eve of the elections and after it emerged jacqui smith , the home secretary , was stepping down .
it was a stupid thing to do in retrospect but it was just putting a brave face on hazel blears on her ' rocking the boat ' badge blears : my resignation ' regrets ' " i genuinely thought i could go without it sparking off this huge firestorm , " she said .
" in hindsight that judgment was wrong .
i should have waited until after the election .
the effect on the party is something i will live with for ever . "
she was followed by another cabinet minister james purnell - who resigned the next day telling mr brown to " stand aside " as leader for the sake of the party .
' annoyed ' activists he told the bbc on friday he had no regrets but would not make trouble for mr brown from the backbenches .
ms blears also said she regretted mocking prime minister gordon brown 's youtube video , which she described as " thoughtless " and wearing a badge saying " rocking the boat " as she quit .
it 's fine for people like myself to forgive hazel .
but it 's not me who she 's got to apologise to lindsay hoyle labour mp for chorley she said she chose to wear the brooch after weeks of intense media pressure on her and her family over her expenses claims .
" at that point i just had enough , it was a stupid thing to do in retrospect but it was just putting a brave face on , " she said .
but brian simpson , the labour mep for the north west of england told bbc radio 4 's pm programme he had been " annoyed " at ms blears ' resignation just as labour activists were out knocking on doors ahead of the elections .
" we were out there on the streets in tough times and to have that happen , it was a bit of a body blow , " he said .
" i know there 's a lot of very unhappy labour party members out there . "
and lindsay hoyle , the labour mp for chorley , also told the bbc a lot of labour activists were angry at the salford mp .
he said : " it 's fine for people like myself to forgive hazel .
but it 's not me who she 's got to apologise to .
it 's the people of salford and all the candidates that were standing on election day and the activists who were knocking on the doors .
it 's the upset that 's caused there . "
he said some people blamed ms blears for a drop in the labour vote and subsequent bnp victories in the region .
but frank field warned that it would be unwise to use the timing of her resignation as an excuse for labour 's bad results .
he also rejected the idea of examining her motives for expressing regret .
