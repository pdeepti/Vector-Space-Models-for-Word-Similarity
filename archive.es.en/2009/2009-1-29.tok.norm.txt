29 , for talks focused mainly on the financial crisis and exports , but merkel did n't miss the opportunity to discuss tibet . germany 's chancellor angela merkel appealed thursday to chinese premier wen jiabao to resume beijing 's talks with envoys of the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader . " germany has an intense interest in the talks with the dalai lama resuming , " merkel told reporters after initial discussions with wen . she said germany was willing to make a " constructive contribution " on the matter , adding that germany did not question the one-china policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was very angry with germany when chancellor merkel met with the dalai lama in 2007 about 60 tibetan demonstrators outside merkel 's office shouted and waved flags and placards as wen 's motorcade arrived for the ceremony .
they asked merkel to press wen to engage in full talks with the dalai lama . relations between germany and china have improved since a spat in 2007 when merkel met the dalai lama , the exiled spiritual leader of tibet , at her office in berlin .
that meeting prompted beijing to suspend a " dialogue " with germany on the rule of law which only recently resumed . improved economic relations wen told journalists there had been broad agreement in his talks with merkel and her ministers which dealt with the global economic slump and financial crisis . the two leaders said they agreed that protectionism must not be the answer to national economic troubles and pledged closer coordination on economic , trade , monetary and finance policy .
the two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding on climate protection with greater cooperation on energy , research and technology .
" my visit to germany puts me in a good mood , " wen told reporters . one of the technologies which china agreed to buy thursday was the german design work for the transrapid , a magnetic-levitation railway system which already operates in shanghai and which china aims to expand . minister praises progress on human rights the chancellor held talks with the chinese premier when she visited china in october last year to take part in the biannual asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year sees tons of chinese goods arriving in the eu on wednesday , germany 's justice minister praised beijing 's " irreversible " progress on human rights and the rule of law . " the chinese are taking their own path , their so-called chinese third way .
i think we should respect that .
we ca n't just say to them , you have to behave like us , " brigitte zypries said in an interview on suedwestrundfunk radio . " but gradually there is movement towards introducing legal standards , and the resulting changes in society and the political system are happening slowly but they are taking place , " the centre-left minister said .
" i believe that -lrb- this progress -rrb- is irreversible for china , " she added . " beijing wants to work with europe " germany is the second stage of a european tour that took wen to switzerland and the world economic forum in davos . this week , wen is also scheduled to visit spain and britain . on friday , he will head a high-level chinese delegation to brussels to meet european commission president jose manuel barroso and other eu commissioners in a bid to heal strained political ties with the 27-nation bloc . earlier this week , wen said beijing is ready to work together with europe to restore confidence in the faltering global financial system . both china and the eu are heavily reliant on each other for trade , business and investment .

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .

according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .
26 .
according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "
the cia rendition flights took suspected terrorists captured in one country to another or a us-run detention center for questioning and , as many allege , torture .
the program began after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

" germany has an intense interest in the talks with the dalai lama resuming , " merkel told reporters after initial discussions with wen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was very angry with germany when chancellor merkel met with the dalai lama in 2007 she said germany was willing to make a " constructive contribution " on the matter , adding that germany did not question the one-china policy .

they asked merkel to press wen to engage in full talks with the dalai lama .
relations between germany and china have improved since a spat in 2007 when merkel met the dalai lama , the exiled spiritual leader of tibet , at her office in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.01.2009 table likely to change as bundesliga resumes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern celebrate again this year ?
the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .

the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .

and their good example has rubbed off on their neighbors . what would germany be without beer and bratwurst ?
well , if the rate of beer consumption continues on its current trajectory , we may just find out .
beer consumption in germany , which once prided itself as a world champion of beer culture , has declined for yet another year as germans reach for a glass of fizzy water instead , national statistics issued thursday show .
domestic sales by the german breweries fell 0.9 percent last year to 8.7 billion liters , and exports were down even more sharply , the federal statistics office said .
eu nations took 1.1 billion liters , down 1.2 percent and non-eu nations 0.3 billion , down 4.1 percent .
the data released in wiesbaden did not cover soft drinks and mineral waters , but previous figures have shown sales of those beverages steadily rising while beer consumption falls back year by year .
if a new study comes out reporting that bratwurst consumption is also on the decline , germany might have to change its name to france and oktoberfest will have to be held in belgium . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .

but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .

their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .

and their good example has rubbed off on their neighbors . what would germany be without beer and bratwurst ?
well , if the rate of beer consumption continues on its current trajectory , we may just find out .
beer consumption in germany , which once prided itself as a world champion of beer culture , has declined for yet another year as germans reach for a glass of fizzy water instead , national statistics issued thursday show .
domestic sales by the german breweries fell 0.9 percent last year to 8.7 billion liters , and exports were down even more sharply , the federal statistics office said .
eu nations took 1.1 billion liters , down 1.2 percent and non-eu nations 0.3 billion , down 4.1 percent .
the data released in wiesbaden did not cover soft drinks and mineral waters , but previous figures have shown sales of those beverages steadily rising while beer consumption falls back year by year .
if a new study comes out reporting that bratwurst consumption is also on the decline , germany might have to change its name to france and oktoberfest will have to be held in belgium . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , for talks focused mainly on the financial crisis and exports , but merkel did n't miss the opportunity to discuss tibet . germany 's chancellor angela merkel appealed thursday to chinese premier wen jiabao to resume beijing 's talks with envoys of the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader .
" germany has an intense interest in the talks with the dalai lama resuming , " merkel told reporters after initial discussions with wen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was very angry with germany when chancellor merkel met with the dalai lama in 2007 she said germany was willing to make a " constructive contribution " on the matter , adding that germany did not question the one-china policy .
about 50 tibetan demonstrators outside merkel 's office shouted and waved flags and placards as wen 's motorcade arrived for the ceremony .
they asked merkel to press wen to engage in full talks with the dalai lama .
relations between germany and china have improved since a spat in 2007 when merkel met the dalai lama , the exiled spiritual leader of tibet , at her office in berlin .
that meeting prompted beijing to suspend a " dialogue " with germany on the rule of law which only recently resumed .
the mood at thursday 's meeting was conciliatory .
the chinese premier said of his visit to the german capital , scheduled to last less than 20 hours , that the leaders " exchanged opinions in an open and honest atmosphere . "
wen described the thaw in relations saying , " after a cold winter , spring brings with it a relationship we can be proud of . "
improved economic relations wen told journalists there had been broad agreement in his talks with merkel and her ministers which dealt with the global economic slump and financial crisis . the two leaders said they agreed that protectionism must not be the answer to national economic troubles and pledged closer coordination on economic , trade , monetary and finance policy . the two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding on climate protection with greater cooperation on energy , research and technology . " my visit to germany puts me in a good mood , " wen told reporters . one of the technologies which china agreed to buy thursday was the german design work for the transrapid , a magnetic-levitation railway system which already operates in shanghai and which china aims to expand . " beijing wants to work with europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year sees tons of chinese goods arriving in the eu germany is the second stage of a european tour that took wen to switzerland and the world economic forum in davos .
this week , wen is also scheduled to visit spain and britain . on friday , he will head a high-level chinese delegation to brussels to meet european commission president jose manuel barroso and other eu commissioners in a bid to heal strained political ties with the 27-nation bloc .
earlier this week , wen said beijing is ready to work together with europe to restore confidence in the faltering global financial system .
both china and the eu are heavily reliant on each other for trade , business and investment .
the eu is china 's largest trading partner , whereas china is the eu 's second-largest after the united states . dw staff -lrb- sp , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the situation in many developing countries threatens to worsen dramatically this year , " the development minister said .
" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .
despite expressing concern at conferences , rich donor countries had only provided 25 percent of the promised funds to help the developing world combat poverty , he said .

" the situation in many developing countries threatens to worsen dramatically this year , " the development minister said .
" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .
despite expressing concern at conferences , rich donor countries had only provided 25 percent of the promised funds to help the developing world combat poverty , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in germany are split over the best use of development aid ute koczy , also from the green party , accused wieczorek-zeul for being partly responsible for the " wrong and catastrophic policy of eu subsidies . "

28 , that it vetted some 173,000 employees as part of an anti-corruption campaign .
politicians were shocked by the news . the revelations of the massive monitoring action and its dimensions contradict earlier statements by the national rail company about its controversial vetting actions .
last week , the company admitted it performed checks on more than 1,000 of its senior managers in a corruption probe , but denied spying on them . but on wednesday , deutsche bahn 's anti-corruption commissioner , wolfgang schaupensteiner , told the parliamentary committee meeting that the vetting , done without the knowledge of those being monitored , was much larger . more then two-thirds of the company 's employees were secretly screened for possible external business activities or links to suppliers , according to information provided by those present at the closed meeting . ' new dimension ' horst friedrich , the transportation expert of the the free-market liberal fdp party called it a " scandal of an entirely new dimension , " while the green party accused the company of a massive violation of the privacy of its employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's wolfgang schaupensteiner says there was nothing unlawful about the vetting program peter schaar , the federal data protection commissioner , said he was appalled by the high number of those who were investigated by the company .

" i wish there 's a howl of protest in the church against the pope 's move , " knobloch told the paper .
" under the circumstances , i certainly ca n't at the moment continue talks with the church , " she said , adding however that the severance of talks was temporary .
jews angered by rehabilitation of holocaust-denier pope benedict xvi on saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four traditionalist catholic bishops including one who denies the holocaust .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's controversial comments have caused an uproar the rehabilitation of british-born richard williamson who has made statements denying the full extent of the holocaust of european jews has caused uproar among jewish leaders and progressive catholics , many of whom said it threatened 50 years of christian-jewish dialogue .
williamson told swedish television in an interview broadcast a week ago : " i believe there were no gas chambers " and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than 6 million .
in germany where holocaust denial is a crime , public prosecutors have opened an investigation against williamson , who made the remarks to the swedish journalists during a visit to germany .
williamson himself seems to have realized that he was opening himself up for prosecution .
" be careful , i beg of you , this is against the law in germany , " williamson told the reporter at the end of the interview .
" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .
the catholic bishop of the southern german city of regensburg , which is also the home of base of pope benedict , said wednesday that williamson would not be allowed to set foot in his cathedral or on any other church property .
pope seeks to heal rift since the uproar caused by his decision to welcome williamson back into the catholic fold , pope benedict has sought to heal the rift with jews .
speaking at his weekly audience , he said the attempt to exterminate jews in the holocaust should remain a warning to all humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has sought to reach out to jews following the controversy recalling his visit to the auschwitz death camp in 2006 , benedict condemned the " pitiless killing of millions of jews , innocent victims of blind racial and religious hatred . "
but knobloch on thursday said she did n't believe the pope 's move had been a spontaneous one .
" the pope is one of the most educated and intelligent persons the catholic church has .
he means every word that he says and each one is well-grounded , " she told the paper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , for talks focused mainly on the financial crisis and exports , but merkel did n't miss the opportunity to discuss tibet . germany 's chancellor angela merkel appealed thursday to chinese premier wen jiabao to resume beijing 's talks with envoys of the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader .
" germany has an intense interest in the talks with the dalai lama resuming , " merkel told reporters after initial discussions with wen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was very angry with germany when chancellor merkel met with the dalai lama in 2007 she said germany was willing to make a " constructive contribution " on the matter , adding that germany did not question the one-china policy .
about 50 tibetan demonstrators outside merkel 's office shouted and waved flags and placards as wen 's motorcade arrived for the ceremony .
they asked merkel to press wen to engage in full talks with the dalai lama .
relations between germany and china have improved since a spat in 2007 when merkel met the dalai lama , the exiled spiritual leader of tibet , at her office in berlin .
that meeting prompted beijing to suspend a " dialogue " with germany on the rule of law which only recently resumed .
the mood at thursday 's meeting was conciliatory .
the chinese premier said of his visit to the german capital , scheduled to last less than 20 hours , that the leaders " exchanged opinions in an open and honest atmosphere . "
wen described the thaw in relations saying , " after a cold winter , spring brings with it a relationship we can be proud of . "
improved economic relations wen told journalists there had been broad agreement in his talks with merkel and her ministers which dealt with the global economic slump and financial crisis . the two leaders said they agreed that protectionism must not be the answer to national economic troubles and pledged closer coordination on economic , trade , monetary and finance policy . the two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding on climate protection with greater cooperation on energy , research and technology . " my visit to germany puts me in a good mood , " wen told reporters . one of the technologies which china agreed to buy thursday was the german design work for the transrapid , a magnetic-levitation railway system which already operates in shanghai and which china aims to expand . " beijing wants to work with europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year sees tons of chinese goods arriving in the eu germany is the second stage of a european tour that took wen to switzerland and the world economic forum in davos .
this week , wen is also scheduled to visit spain and britain . on friday , he will head a high-level chinese delegation to brussels to meet european commission president jose manuel barroso and other eu commissioners in a bid to heal strained political ties with the 27-nation bloc .
earlier this week , wen said beijing is ready to work together with europe to restore confidence in the faltering global financial system .
both china and the eu are heavily reliant on each other for trade , business and investment .
the eu is china 's largest trading partner , whereas china is the eu 's second-largest after the united states . dw staff -lrb- sp , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's controversial comments have caused an uproar the rehabilitation of british-born richard williamson who has made statements denying the full extent of the holocaust of european jews has caused uproar among jewish leaders and progressive catholics , many of whom said it threatened 50 years of christian-jewish dialogue .
williamson told swedish television in an interview broadcast a week ago : " i believe there were no gas chambers " and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than 6 million .
in germany where holocaust denial is a crime , public prosecutors have opened an investigation against williamson , who made the remarks to the swedish journalists during a visit to germany .
williamson himself seems to have realized that he was opening himself up for prosecution .
" be careful , i beg of you , this is against the law in germany , " williamson told the reporter at the end of the interview .
" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .
the catholic bishop of the southern german city of regensburg , which is also the home of base of pope benedict , said wednesday that williamson would not be allowed to set foot in his cathedral or on any other church property .
pope seeks to heal rift since the uproar caused by his decision to welcome williamson back into the catholic fold , pope benedict has sought to heal the rift with jews .
speaking at his weekly audience , he said the attempt to exterminate jews in the holocaust should remain a warning to all humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has sought to reach out to jews following the controversy recalling his visit to the auschwitz death camp in 2006 , benedict condemned the " pitiless killing of millions of jews , innocent victims of blind racial and religious hatred . "
but knobloch on thursday said she did n't believe the pope 's move had been a spontaneous one .
" the pope is one of the most educated and intelligent persons the catholic church has .
he means every word that he says and each one is well-grounded , " she told the paper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .
26 .
according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "
the cia rendition flights took suspected terrorists captured in one country to another or a us-run detention center for questioning and , as many allege , torture .

26 .
according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "
the cia rendition flights took suspected terrorists captured in one country to another or a us-run detention center for questioning and , as many allege , torture .
the program began after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had forecast that an additional 30,000 germans would be out of work .
in politically more important seasonally unadjusted terms , the number of people out of work surged by 387,000 to 3.489 million , pushing up the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent .
" the demand for labor fell strongly , " said german labor office chief frank-juergen weise .
jobless data follows wave of layoffs german employment hit a record 40.3 million last year to reach the highest level since german unification in 1990 as solid economic growth and labor market reforms helped to boost hiring in recent years .
but as 2008 drew to a close , the global slowdown began to tighten its grip on the german economy with both economists and the country 's labor office warning that joblessness in the country will rise in the coming months .
indeed , the new german jobless data follows a series of announcements by companies about plans for layoffs and production cuts as they face up to what is expected to be the biggest economic downturn since the end of the second world war .
on wednesday , europe 's biggest software manufacturer sap ag added its name to the list of companies cutting jobs when it announced that the global economic downturn had forced the german-based company to slash its workforce by about six percent or 3,000 jobs .

analysts had forecast that an additional 30,000 germans would be out of work .
in politically more important seasonally unadjusted terms , the number of people out of work surged by 387,000 to 3.489 million , pushing up the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent .
" the demand for labor fell strongly , " said german labor office chief frank-juergen weise .
jobless data follows wave of layoffs german employment hit a record 40.3 million last year to reach the highest level since german unification in 1990 as solid economic growth and labor market reforms helped to boost hiring in recent years .
but as 2008 drew to a close , the global slowdown began to tighten its grip on the german economy with both economists and the country 's labor office warning that joblessness in the country will rise in the coming months .
indeed , the new german jobless data follows a series of announcements by companies about plans for layoffs and production cuts as they face up to what is expected to be the biggest economic downturn since the end of the second world war .
on wednesday , europe 's biggest software manufacturer sap ag added its name to the list of companies cutting jobs when it announced that the global economic downturn had forced the german-based company to slash its workforce by about six percent or 3,000 jobs .

the unions said more than 200 rail personnel in munich and nuremberg stopped work while around 150 laid down their tools in cologne , disrupting train services on both regional and long-haul stretches .
according to deutsche bahn , the strikes delayed services between cologne and dusseldorf .
but the company said it would try to soften the strikes ' impact by pressing additional workers into service .
deutsche bahn began alerting passengers on wednesday to a disruption of services .
in hamburg , employees in the customer-service department stopped work for two hours , causing minor disruptions .
the strikes were also expected to be expanded to the cities of bremen , saalfeld , magdeburg and the capital berlin .
strikes meant as a " warning signal " the unions said the strikes were n't meant to cripple services but rather serve as a " warning signal . "
the two unions representing 130,000 railway staff are demanding a 10-percent pay increase and restrictions on night and weekend work .
deutsche bahn has proposed a 1 percent pay raise , but has promised to improve the offer .
business and employer representatives however urged the unions to avoid organizing strikes at a time when germany is in the grip of recession .

analysts had forecast that an additional 30,000 germans would be out of work .
in politically more important seasonally unadjusted terms , the number of people out of work surged by 387,000 to 3.489 million , pushing up the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent .
" the demand for labor fell strongly , " said german labor office chief frank-juergen weise .
jobless data follows wave of layoffs german employment hit a record 40.3 million last year to reach the highest level since german unification in 1990 as solid economic growth and labor market reforms helped to boost hiring in recent years .
but as 2008 drew to a close , the global slowdown began to tighten its grip on the german economy with both economists and the country 's labor office warning that joblessness in the country will rise in the coming months .
indeed , the new german jobless data follows a series of announcements by companies about plans for layoffs and production cuts as they face up to what is expected to be the biggest economic downturn since the end of the second world war .
on wednesday , europe 's biggest software manufacturer sap ag added its name to the list of companies cutting jobs when it announced that the global economic downturn had forced the german-based company to slash its workforce by about six percent or 3,000 jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

28 , that it vetted some 173,000 employees as part of an anti-corruption campaign .
politicians were shocked by the news . the revelations of the massive monitoring action and its dimensions contradict earlier statements by the national rail company about its controversial vetting actions .
last week , the company admitted it performed checks on more than 1,000 of its senior managers in a corruption probe , but denied spying on them . but on wednesday , deutsche bahn 's anti-corruption commissioner , wolfgang schaupensteiner , told the parliamentary committee meeting that the vetting , done without the knowledge of those being monitored , was much larger . more then two-thirds of the company 's employees were secretly screened for possible external business activities or links to suppliers , according to information provided by those present at the closed meeting . ' new dimension ' horst friedrich , the transportation expert of the the free-market liberal fdp party called it a " scandal of an entirely new dimension , " while the green party accused the company of a massive violation of the privacy of its employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's wolfgang schaupensteiner says there was nothing unlawful about the vetting program peter schaar , the federal data protection commissioner , said he was appalled by the high number of those who were investigated by the company .
" it is complete nonsense when every single conductor falls under general suspicion . " the screenings took place in 2002 and 2003 when data such as addresses , telephone numbers and banking information was compared with a list of 80,000 companies that do business with deutsche bahn .
according to those in the committee hearing , out of 173,000 reviews , 100 cases of impropriety turned up . for its part , deutsche bahn defended its actions , calling them lawful and proper . " contrary to many assertions , there is nothing wrong with comparing employee and supplier addresses , or so-called ' screening ' , regardless of the number of vetted employees , " said deutsche bahn spokesperson oliver schumacher . already under fire but just last week , deutsche bahn found itself under fire for its vetting program in 2002 and 2003 , which was uncovered by an article in the newsmagazine stern , which said the surveillance was conducted by network deutschland - the same company used by deutsche telekom to secretly monitor its workers . then , schaupensteiner accused the magazine of rehashing an old story that was based on information which he said deutsche bahn had already made public in june 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn was looking for clues to outside business activities or links to supplies " there have been no new cases since then , " spokesman wolfgang schaupensteiner said . the magazine report referred to two major surveillance operations conducted in 2002 and 2003 in which executives and their wives were vetted for possible external business activities or links to suppliers . he had said this was " a legitimate and necessary action in order to track down a potential conflict of interests , " adding it was not uncommon in major concerns for employees to set up their own companies and then " place orders with themselves . " the data protection watchdog , schaar , has demanded legal action be taken against the company the parliamentary transportation committee is to meet on feb .
11 and take up the matter again .
the committee gave schaupensteiner a list of 60 questions to answer and has said it wants to question two other deutsche bahn executives in charge of auditing and security . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .
26 .
according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "
the cia rendition flights took suspected terrorists captured in one country to another or a us-run detention center for questioning and , as many allege , torture .

29 , for talks focused mainly on the financial crisis and exports , but merkel did n't miss the opportunity to discuss tibet . germany 's chancellor angela merkel appealed thursday to chinese premier wen jiabao to resume beijing 's talks with envoys of the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader .

they asked merkel to press wen to engage in full talks with the dalai lama . relations between germany and china have improved since a spat in 2007 when merkel met the dalai lama , the exiled spiritual leader of tibet , at her office in berlin .

the two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding on climate protection with greater cooperation on energy , research and technology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.01.2009 table likely to change as bundesliga resumes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern celebrate again this year ?
the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.01.2009 table likely to change as bundesliga resumes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern celebrate again this year ?
the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .
26 .
according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "
the cia rendition flights took suspected terrorists captured in one country to another or a us-run detention center for questioning and , as many allege , torture .

analysts had forecast that an additional 30,000 germans would be out of work .
in politically more important seasonally unadjusted terms , the number of people out of work surged by 387,000 to 3.489 million , pushing up the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent .

indeed , the new german jobless data follows a series of announcements by companies about plans for layoffs and production cuts as they face up to what is expected to be the biggest economic downturn since the end of the second world war .
on wednesday , europe 's biggest software manufacturer sap ag added its name to the list of companies cutting jobs when it announced that the global economic downturn had forced the german-based company to slash its workforce by about six percent or 3,000 jobs .

" i wish there 's a howl of protest in the church against the pope 's move , " knobloch told the paper .
" under the circumstances , i certainly ca n't at the moment continue talks with the church , " she said , adding however that the severance of talks was temporary .
jews angered by rehabilitation of holocaust-denier pope benedict xvi on saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four traditionalist catholic bishops including one who denies the holocaust .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's controversial comments have caused an uproar the rehabilitation of british-born richard williamson who has made statements denying the full extent of the holocaust of european jews has caused uproar among jewish leaders and progressive catholics , many of whom said it threatened 50 years of christian-jewish dialogue .
williamson told swedish television in an interview broadcast a week ago : " i believe there were no gas chambers " and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than 6 million .
in germany where holocaust denial is a crime , public prosecutors have opened an investigation against williamson , who made the remarks to the swedish journalists during a visit to germany .
williamson himself seems to have realized that he was opening himself up for prosecution .
" be careful , i beg of you , this is against the law in germany , " williamson told the reporter at the end of the interview .
" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .
the catholic bishop of the southern german city of regensburg , which is also the home of base of pope benedict , said wednesday that williamson would not be allowed to set foot in his cathedral or on any other church property .
pope seeks to heal rift since the uproar caused by his decision to welcome williamson back into the catholic fold , pope benedict has sought to heal the rift with jews .
speaking at his weekly audience , he said the attempt to exterminate jews in the holocaust should remain a warning to all humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has sought to reach out to jews following the controversy recalling his visit to the auschwitz death camp in 2006 , benedict condemned the " pitiless killing of millions of jews , innocent victims of blind racial and religious hatred . "
but knobloch on thursday said she did n't believe the pope 's move had been a spontaneous one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .

and their good example has rubbed off on their neighbors . what would germany be without beer and bratwurst ?
well , if the rate of beer consumption continues on its current trajectory , we may just find out .
beer consumption in germany , which once prided itself as a world champion of beer culture , has declined for yet another year as germans reach for a glass of fizzy water instead , national statistics issued thursday show .
domestic sales by the german breweries fell 0.9 percent last year to 8.7 billion liters , and exports were down even more sharply , the federal statistics office said .
eu nations took 1.1 billion liters , down 1.2 percent and non-eu nations 0.3 billion , down 4.1 percent .
the data released in wiesbaden did not cover soft drinks and mineral waters , but previous figures have shown sales of those beverages steadily rising while beer consumption falls back year by year .
if a new study comes out reporting that bratwurst consumption is also on the decline , germany might have to change its name to france and oktoberfest will have to be held in belgium . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

" i wish there 's a howl of protest in the church against the pope 's move , " knobloch told the paper .
" under the circumstances , i certainly ca n't at the moment continue talks with the church , " she said , adding however that the severance of talks was temporary .
jews angered by rehabilitation of holocaust-denier pope benedict xvi on saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four traditionalist catholic bishops including one who denies the holocaust .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's controversial comments have caused an uproar the rehabilitation of british-born richard williamson who has made statements denying the full extent of the holocaust of european jews has caused uproar among jewish leaders and progressive catholics , many of whom said it threatened 50 years of christian-jewish dialogue .
williamson told swedish television in an interview broadcast a week ago : " i believe there were no gas chambers " and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than 6 million .
in germany where holocaust denial is a crime , public prosecutors have opened an investigation against williamson , who made the remarks to the swedish journalists during a visit to germany .
williamson himself seems to have realized that he was opening himself up for prosecution .
" be careful , i beg of you , this is against the law in germany , " williamson told the reporter at the end of the interview .
" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .
the catholic bishop of the southern german city of regensburg , which is also the home of base of pope benedict , said wednesday that williamson would not be allowed to set foot in his cathedral or on any other church property .
pope seeks to heal rift since the uproar caused by his decision to welcome williamson back into the catholic fold , pope benedict has sought to heal the rift with jews .
speaking at his weekly audience , he said the attempt to exterminate jews in the holocaust should remain a warning to all humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has sought to reach out to jews following the controversy recalling his visit to the auschwitz death camp in 2006 , benedict condemned the " pitiless killing of millions of jews , innocent victims of blind racial and religious hatred . "
but knobloch on thursday said she did n't believe the pope 's move had been a spontaneous one .

28 , that it vetted some 173,000 employees as part of an anti-corruption campaign .
politicians were shocked by the news . the revelations of the massive monitoring action and its dimensions contradict earlier statements by the national rail company about its controversial vetting actions .
last week , the company admitted it performed checks on more than 1,000 of its senior managers in a corruption probe , but denied spying on them . but on wednesday , deutsche bahn 's anti-corruption commissioner , wolfgang schaupensteiner , told the parliamentary committee meeting that the vetting , done without the knowledge of those being monitored , was much larger . more then two-thirds of the company 's employees were secretly screened for possible external business activities or links to suppliers , according to information provided by those present at the closed meeting . ' new dimension ' horst friedrich , the transportation expert of the the free-market liberal fdp party called it a " scandal of an entirely new dimension , " while the green party accused the company of a massive violation of the privacy of its employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's wolfgang schaupensteiner says there was nothing unlawful about the vetting program peter schaar , the federal data protection commissioner , said he was appalled by the high number of those who were investigated by the company .
" it is complete nonsense when every single conductor falls under general suspicion . " the screenings took place in 2002 and 2003 when data such as addresses , telephone numbers and banking information was compared with a list of 80,000 companies that do business with deutsche bahn .
according to those in the committee hearing , out of 173,000 reviews , 100 cases of impropriety turned up . for its part , deutsche bahn defended its actions , calling them lawful and proper . " contrary to many assertions , there is nothing wrong with comparing employee and supplier addresses , or so-called ' screening ' , regardless of the number of vetted employees , " said deutsche bahn spokesperson oliver schumacher . already under fire but just last week , deutsche bahn found itself under fire for its vetting program in 2002 and 2003 , which was uncovered by an article in the newsmagazine stern , which said the surveillance was conducted by network deutschland - the same company used by deutsche telekom to secretly monitor its workers . then , schaupensteiner accused the magazine of rehashing an old story that was based on information which he said deutsche bahn had already made public in june 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn was looking for clues to outside business activities or links to supplies " there have been no new cases since then , " spokesman wolfgang schaupensteiner said . the magazine report referred to two major surveillance operations conducted in 2002 and 2003 in which executives and their wives were vetted for possible external business activities or links to suppliers . he had said this was " a legitimate and necessary action in order to track down a potential conflict of interests , " adding it was not uncommon in major concerns for employees to set up their own companies and then " place orders with themselves . " the data protection watchdog , schaar , has demanded legal action be taken against the company the parliamentary transportation committee is to meet on feb .
11 and take up the matter again .
the committee gave schaupensteiner a list of 60 questions to answer and has said it wants to question two other deutsche bahn executives in charge of auditing and security . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" under the circumstances , i certainly ca n't at the moment continue talks with the church , " she said , adding however that the severance of talks was temporary .

i hope that 's not your intention . "

in addition , hundreds of thousands of people marched in the streets in some 200 cities and towns to express their displeasure with the economic policies of president nicolas sarkozy and his government .
major trade unions called the strike to demand more job security , additional state aid to small and mid-sized companies threatened by the economic crisis and a halt to some of sarkozy 's economic reforms .
education ministry to cut jobs according to julien pons , a 28-year-old teacher protesting in paris , " the government wants to impose the logic of the private sector on the public sector .
so i am striking to protest the privatization of the public sector , stagnating salaries and the government 's plans to cut jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french education minister xavier darcos plans to cut 13,500 jobs education minister xavier darcos is planning to slash 13,500 jobs from the french education system in 2009 , a measure that unions say will severely impair the quality of education .
" there is a general disdain because it is impossible to have discussions with the government , " pons said .
the fsu trade union said that more than 60 percent of all primary and secondary schoolteachers were taking part in the strike .
the government 's figures were significantly lower .
rail workers kick off strike in addition , public transport in 77 cities and towns across france was disrupted to varying degrees on thursday , after employees of the state-owned sncf rail network kicked off the strike late wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train stations , like this one in paris , were empty on thursday the cgt union said 41 percent of railway employees were striking .
the sncf said about half of all scheduled high-speed tgv and regional trains were operating .
in the greater paris area , more than half of scheduled trains linking the capital with its suburbs were not in service thursday , while an average of about one of two scheduled metro trains were running in the city , the ratp transport system said .
however , there was none of the usual strike-day chaos because many employees stayed away from their jobs , either out of sympathy for the strike or to avoid spending long hours in transit .
litmus test for the government in the southern city of marseille , however , no metro trains were operating on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike organizers estimate around 300,000 people marched in marseille the head of the cfdt trade union , francois chereque , called the day 's street protests " the largest workers ' demonstration in france in 20 years . "
his counterpart from the cgt union , bernard thibault , said that by mid-day " 1 million people " had already taken part in protest marches .
organizers said that up to 300,000 people marched through the streets of marseille .
again , police estimates were much lower .

" the situation in many developing countries threatens to worsen dramatically this year , " the development minister said .
" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .
despite expressing concern at conferences , rich donor countries had only provided 25 percent of the promised funds to help the developing world combat poverty , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in germany are split over the best use of development aid ute koczy , also from the green party , accused wieczorek-zeul for being partly responsible for the " wrong and catastrophic policy of eu subsidies . "

and their good example has rubbed off on their neighbors . what would germany be without beer and bratwurst ?
well , if the rate of beer consumption continues on its current trajectory , we may just find out .
beer consumption in germany , which once prided itself as a world champion of beer culture , has declined for yet another year as germans reach for a glass of fizzy water instead , national statistics issued thursday show .
domestic sales by the german breweries fell 0.9 percent last year to 8.7 billion liters , and exports were down even more sharply , the federal statistics office said .
eu nations took 1.1 billion liters , down 1.2 percent and non-eu nations 0.3 billion , down 4.1 percent .
the data released in wiesbaden did not cover soft drinks and mineral waters , but previous figures have shown sales of those beverages steadily rising while beer consumption falls back year by year .
if a new study comes out reporting that bratwurst consumption is also on the decline , germany might have to change its name to france and oktoberfest will have to be held in belgium . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , that it vetted some 173,000 employees as part of an anti-corruption campaign .
politicians were shocked by the news . the revelations of the massive monitoring action and its dimensions contradict earlier statements by the national rail company about its controversial vetting actions .
last week , the company admitted it performed checks on more than 1,000 of its senior managers in a corruption probe , but denied spying on them . but on wednesday , deutsche bahn 's anti-corruption commissioner , wolfgang schaupensteiner , told the parliamentary committee meeting that the vetting , done without the knowledge of those being monitored , was much larger . more then two-thirds of the company 's employees were secretly screened for possible external business activities or links to suppliers , according to information provided by those present at the closed meeting . ' new dimension ' horst friedrich , the transportation expert of the the free-market liberal fdp party called it a " scandal of an entirely new dimension , " while the green party accused the company of a massive violation of the privacy of its employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's wolfgang schaupensteiner says there was nothing unlawful about the vetting program peter schaar , the federal data protection commissioner , said he was appalled by the high number of those who were investigated by the company .
" it is complete nonsense when every single conductor falls under general suspicion . " the screenings took place in 2002 and 2003 when data such as addresses , telephone numbers and banking information was compared with a list of 80,000 companies that do business with deutsche bahn .
according to those in the committee hearing , out of 173,000 reviews , 100 cases of impropriety turned up . for its part , deutsche bahn defended its actions , calling them lawful and proper . " contrary to many assertions , there is nothing wrong with comparing employee and supplier addresses , or so-called ' screening ' , regardless of the number of vetted employees , " said deutsche bahn spokesperson oliver schumacher . already under fire but just last week , deutsche bahn found itself under fire for its vetting program in 2002 and 2003 , which was uncovered by an article in the newsmagazine stern , which said the surveillance was conducted by network deutschland - the same company used by deutsche telekom to secretly monitor its workers . then , schaupensteiner accused the magazine of rehashing an old story that was based on information which he said deutsche bahn had already made public in june 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn was looking for clues to outside business activities or links to supplies " there have been no new cases since then , " spokesman wolfgang schaupensteiner said . the magazine report referred to two major surveillance operations conducted in 2002 and 2003 in which executives and their wives were vetted for possible external business activities or links to suppliers . he had said this was " a legitimate and necessary action in order to track down a potential conflict of interests , " adding it was not uncommon in major concerns for employees to set up their own companies and then " place orders with themselves . " the data protection watchdog , schaar , has demanded legal action be taken against the company the parliamentary transportation committee is to meet on feb .
11 and take up the matter again .
the committee gave schaupensteiner a list of 60 questions to answer and has said it wants to question two other deutsche bahn executives in charge of auditing and security . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i wish there 's a howl of protest in the church against the pope 's move , " knobloch told the paper .
" under the circumstances , i certainly ca n't at the moment continue talks with the church , " she said , adding however that the severance of talks was temporary .
jews angered by rehabilitation of holocaust-denier pope benedict xvi on saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four traditionalist catholic bishops including one who denies the holocaust .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's controversial comments have caused an uproar the rehabilitation of british-born richard williamson who has made statements denying the full extent of the holocaust of european jews has caused uproar among jewish leaders and progressive catholics , many of whom said it threatened 50 years of christian-jewish dialogue .
williamson told swedish television in an interview broadcast a week ago : " i believe there were no gas chambers " and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than 6 million .
in germany where holocaust denial is a crime , public prosecutors have opened an investigation against williamson , who made the remarks to the swedish journalists during a visit to germany .
williamson himself seems to have realized that he was opening himself up for prosecution .
" be careful , i beg of you , this is against the law in germany , " williamson told the reporter at the end of the interview .
" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .
the catholic bishop of the southern german city of regensburg , which is also the home of base of pope benedict , said wednesday that williamson would not be allowed to set foot in his cathedral or on any other church property .
pope seeks to heal rift since the uproar caused by his decision to welcome williamson back into the catholic fold , pope benedict has sought to heal the rift with jews .
speaking at his weekly audience , he said the attempt to exterminate jews in the holocaust should remain a warning to all humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has sought to reach out to jews following the controversy recalling his visit to the auschwitz death camp in 2006 , benedict condemned the " pitiless killing of millions of jews , innocent victims of blind racial and religious hatred . "
but knobloch on thursday said she did n't believe the pope 's move had been a spontaneous one .
" the pope is one of the most educated and intelligent persons the catholic church has .
he means every word that he says and each one is well-grounded , " she told the paper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the situation in many developing countries threatens to worsen dramatically this year , " the development minister said .
" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .
despite expressing concern at conferences , rich donor countries had only provided 25 percent of the promised funds to help the developing world combat poverty , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in germany are split over the best use of development aid ute koczy , also from the green party , accused wieczorek-zeul for being partly responsible for the " wrong and catastrophic policy of eu subsidies . "

" the situation in many developing countries threatens to worsen dramatically this year , " the development minister said .
" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .
despite expressing concern at conferences , rich donor countries had only provided 25 percent of the promised funds to help the developing world combat poverty , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in germany are split over the best use of development aid ute koczy , also from the green party , accused wieczorek-zeul for being partly responsible for the " wrong and catastrophic policy of eu subsidies . "

analysts had forecast that an additional 30,000 germans would be out of work .
in politically more important seasonally unadjusted terms , the number of people out of work surged by 387,000 to 3.489 million , pushing up the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent .
" the demand for labor fell strongly , " said german labor office chief frank-juergen weise .
jobless data follows wave of layoffs german employment hit a record 40.3 million last year to reach the highest level since german unification in 1990 as solid economic growth and labor market reforms helped to boost hiring in recent years .
but as 2008 drew to a close , the global slowdown began to tighten its grip on the german economy with both economists and the country 's labor office warning that joblessness in the country will rise in the coming months .
indeed , the new german jobless data follows a series of announcements by companies about plans for layoffs and production cuts as they face up to what is expected to be the biggest economic downturn since the end of the second world war .
on wednesday , europe 's biggest software manufacturer sap ag added its name to the list of companies cutting jobs when it announced that the global economic downturn had forced the german-based company to slash its workforce by about six percent or 3,000 jobs .
chancellor angela merkel 's government this week agreed to a second economic stimulus package worth 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.5 billion -rrb- over the next two years and which is partly aimed at kick-starting economic growth through a batch of infrastructure projects and tax cuts . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , that it vetted some 173,000 employees as part of an anti-corruption campaign .
politicians were shocked by the news . the revelations of the massive monitoring action and its dimensions contradict earlier statements by the national rail company about its controversial vetting actions .
last week , the company admitted it performed checks on more than 1,000 of its senior managers in a corruption probe , but denied spying on them . but on wednesday , deutsche bahn 's anti-corruption commissioner , wolfgang schaupensteiner , told the parliamentary committee meeting that the vetting , done without the knowledge of those being monitored , was much larger . more then two-thirds of the company 's employees were secretly screened for possible external business activities or links to suppliers , according to information provided by those present at the closed meeting . ' new dimension ' horst friedrich , the transportation expert of the the free-market liberal fdp party called it a " scandal of an entirely new dimension , " while the green party accused the company of a massive violation of the privacy of its employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's wolfgang schaupensteiner says there was nothing unlawful about the vetting program peter schaar , the federal data protection commissioner , said he was appalled by the high number of those who were investigated by the company .
" it is complete nonsense when every single conductor falls under general suspicion . " the screenings took place in 2002 and 2003 when data such as addresses , telephone numbers and banking information was compared with a list of 80,000 companies that do business with deutsche bahn .
according to those in the committee hearing , out of 173,000 reviews , 100 cases of impropriety turned up . for its part , deutsche bahn defended its actions , calling them lawful and proper . " contrary to many assertions , there is nothing wrong with comparing employee and supplier addresses , or so-called ' screening ' , regardless of the number of vetted employees , " said deutsche bahn spokesperson oliver schumacher . already under fire but just last week , deutsche bahn found itself under fire for its vetting program in 2002 and 2003 , which was uncovered by an article in the newsmagazine stern , which said the surveillance was conducted by network deutschland - the same company used by deutsche telekom to secretly monitor its workers . then , schaupensteiner accused the magazine of rehashing an old story that was based on information which he said deutsche bahn had already made public in june 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn was looking for clues to outside business activities or links to supplies " there have been no new cases since then , " spokesman wolfgang schaupensteiner said . the magazine report referred to two major surveillance operations conducted in 2002 and 2003 in which executives and their wives were vetted for possible external business activities or links to suppliers . he had said this was " a legitimate and necessary action in order to track down a potential conflict of interests , " adding it was not uncommon in major concerns for employees to set up their own companies and then " place orders with themselves . " the data protection watchdog , schaar , has demanded legal action be taken against the company the parliamentary transportation committee is to meet on feb .
11 and take up the matter again .
the committee gave schaupensteiner a list of 60 questions to answer and has said it wants to question two other deutsche bahn executives in charge of auditing and security . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

analysts had forecast that an additional 30,000 germans would be out of work .
in politically more important seasonally unadjusted terms , the number of people out of work surged by 387,000 to 3.489 million , pushing up the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent .
" the demand for labor fell strongly , " said german labor office chief frank-juergen weise .
jobless data follows wave of layoffs german employment hit a record 40.3 million last year to reach the highest level since german unification in 1990 as solid economic growth and labor market reforms helped to boost hiring in recent years .
but as 2008 drew to a close , the global slowdown began to tighten its grip on the german economy with both economists and the country 's labor office warning that joblessness in the country will rise in the coming months .
indeed , the new german jobless data follows a series of announcements by companies about plans for layoffs and production cuts as they face up to what is expected to be the biggest economic downturn since the end of the second world war .
on wednesday , europe 's biggest software manufacturer sap ag added its name to the list of companies cutting jobs when it announced that the global economic downturn had forced the german-based company to slash its workforce by about six percent or 3,000 jobs .
chancellor angela merkel 's government this week agreed to a second economic stimulus package worth 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.5 billion -rrb- over the next two years and which is partly aimed at kick-starting economic growth through a batch of infrastructure projects and tax cuts . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and their good example has rubbed off on their neighbors . what would germany be without beer and bratwurst ?
well , if the rate of beer consumption continues on its current trajectory , we may just find out .
beer consumption in germany , which once prided itself as a world champion of beer culture , has declined for yet another year as germans reach for a glass of fizzy water instead , national statistics issued thursday show .
domestic sales by the german breweries fell 0.9 percent last year to 8.7 billion liters , and exports were down even more sharply , the federal statistics office said .
eu nations took 1.1 billion liters , down 1.2 percent and non-eu nations 0.3 billion , down 4.1 percent .
the data released in wiesbaden did not cover soft drinks and mineral waters , but previous figures have shown sales of those beverages steadily rising while beer consumption falls back year by year .
if a new study comes out reporting that bratwurst consumption is also on the decline , germany might have to change its name to france and oktoberfest will have to be held in belgium . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , that it vetted some 173,000 employees as part of an anti-corruption campaign .
politicians were shocked by the news . the revelations of the massive monitoring action and its dimensions contradict earlier statements by the national rail company about its controversial vetting actions .
last week , the company admitted it performed checks on more than 1,000 of its senior managers in a corruption probe , but denied spying on them . but on wednesday , deutsche bahn 's anti-corruption commissioner , wolfgang schaupensteiner , told the parliamentary committee meeting that the vetting , done without the knowledge of those being monitored , was much larger . more then two-thirds of the company 's employees were secretly screened for possible external business activities or links to suppliers , according to information provided by those present at the closed meeting . ' new dimension ' horst friedrich , the transportation expert of the the free-market liberal fdp party called it a " scandal of an entirely new dimension , " while the green party accused the company of a massive violation of the privacy of its employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's wolfgang schaupensteiner says there was nothing unlawful about the vetting program peter schaar , the federal data protection commissioner , said he was appalled by the high number of those who were investigated by the company .
" it is complete nonsense when every single conductor falls under general suspicion . " the screenings took place in 2002 and 2003 when data such as addresses , telephone numbers and banking information was compared with a list of 80,000 companies that do business with deutsche bahn .
according to those in the committee hearing , out of 173,000 reviews , 100 cases of impropriety turned up . for its part , deutsche bahn defended its actions , calling them lawful and proper . " contrary to many assertions , there is nothing wrong with comparing employee and supplier addresses , or so-called ' screening ' , regardless of the number of vetted employees , " said deutsche bahn spokesperson oliver schumacher . already under fire but just last week , deutsche bahn found itself under fire for its vetting program in 2002 and 2003 , which was uncovered by an article in the newsmagazine stern , which said the surveillance was conducted by network deutschland - the same company used by deutsche telekom to secretly monitor its workers . then , schaupensteiner accused the magazine of rehashing an old story that was based on information which he said deutsche bahn had already made public in june 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn was looking for clues to outside business activities or links to supplies " there have been no new cases since then , " spokesman wolfgang schaupensteiner said . the magazine report referred to two major surveillance operations conducted in 2002 and 2003 in which executives and their wives were vetted for possible external business activities or links to suppliers . he had said this was " a legitimate and necessary action in order to track down a potential conflict of interests , " adding it was not uncommon in major concerns for employees to set up their own companies and then " place orders with themselves . " the data protection watchdog , schaar , has demanded legal action be taken against the company the parliamentary transportation committee is to meet on feb .
11 and take up the matter again .

" the situation in many developing countries threatens to worsen dramatically this year , " the development minister said .
" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .
despite expressing concern at conferences , rich donor countries had only provided 25 percent of the promised funds to help the developing world combat poverty , he said .

" the situation in many developing countries threatens to worsen dramatically this year , " the development minister said .
" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .
despite expressing concern at conferences , rich donor countries had only provided 25 percent of the promised funds to help the developing world combat poverty , he said .

28 , that it vetted some 173,000 employees as part of an anti-corruption campaign .
politicians were shocked by the news . the revelations of the massive monitoring action and its dimensions contradict earlier statements by the national rail company about its controversial vetting actions .
last week , the company admitted it performed checks on more than 1,000 of its senior managers in a corruption probe , but denied spying on them . but on wednesday , deutsche bahn 's anti-corruption commissioner , wolfgang schaupensteiner , told the parliamentary committee meeting that the vetting , done without the knowledge of those being monitored , was much larger . more then two-thirds of the company 's employees were secretly screened for possible external business activities or links to suppliers , according to information provided by those present at the closed meeting . ' new dimension ' horst friedrich , the transportation expert of the the free-market liberal fdp party called it a " scandal of an entirely new dimension , " while the green party accused the company of a massive violation of the privacy of its employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's wolfgang schaupensteiner says there was nothing unlawful about the vetting program peter schaar , the federal data protection commissioner , said he was appalled by the high number of those who were investigated by the company .

the mood at thursday 's meeting was conciliatory .
the chinese premier said of his visit to the german capital , scheduled to last less than 20 hours , that the leaders " exchanged opinions in an open and honest atmosphere . "
wen described the thaw in relations saying , " after a cold winter , spring brings with it a relationship we can be proud of . "
improved economic relations wen told journalists there had been broad agreement in his talks with merkel and her ministers which dealt with the global economic slump and financial crisis . the two leaders said they agreed that protectionism must not be the answer to national economic troubles and pledged closer coordination on economic , trade , monetary and finance policy . the two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding on climate protection with greater cooperation on energy , research and technology . " my visit to germany puts me in a good mood , " wen told reporters . one of the technologies which china agreed to buy thursday was the german design work for the transrapid , a magnetic-levitation railway system which already operates in shanghai and which china aims to expand .

major trade unions called the strike to demand more job security , additional state aid to small and mid-sized companies threatened by the economic crisis and a halt to some of sarkozy 's economic reforms .

the fsu trade union said that more than 60 percent of all primary and secondary schoolteachers were taking part in the strike .

organizers said that up to 300,000 people marched through the streets of marseille .

the extent of the strikes and the number of protesters in the streets will be closely watched , as they represent an important test of strength between unions and sarkozy .

the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "
the cia rendition flights took suspected terrorists captured in one country to another or a us-run detention center for questioning and , as many allege , torture .

the nation is strongly influenced by regional history and culture . germany is in the middle of europe .
it is bordered by denmark to the north , and it also shares borders with the netherlands , belgium , luxemburg , france , switzerland , austria , the czech republic and poland .
its capital is berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boats cruise germany 's many rivers ; here , the danube more than 82 million people live between the north and baltic seas in the north , and the alps in the south of germany .
a number of midsize mountain ranges traverse the country .
its most important rivers include the rhine , the danube , the elbe and the oder .
there are lakes too - mostly in the northeast , in the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , but also in the foothills of the alps . the northern coasts are dotted with numerous islands , and the metropolises include berlin , hamburg , munich , the ruhr valley , cologne , and the rhine-main region around frankfurt . consequences of world war ii at the end of world war ii , the occupying powers divided germany . on may 23 , 1949 , the federal republic of germany was created along with its basic law , or constitution .
supported by the allied powers after the war , this western half of germany experienced what is called the wirtschaftswunder , or economic miracle .
this was led foremost by the coal and steel industries of the ruhr valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nation 's capital , berlin , has a rich history the eastern part of germany - which used to be called the german democratic republc , or gdr - was created by the soviet occupying forces and was tied what was then known as the east bloc .
the berlin wall was built to divide east and west germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.01.2009 table likely to change as bundesliga resumes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern celebrate again this year ?
the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i wish there 's a howl of protest in the church against the pope 's move , " knobloch told the paper .
" under the circumstances , i certainly ca n't at the moment continue talks with the church , " she said , adding however that the severance of talks was temporary .
jews angered by rehabilitation of holocaust-denier pope benedict xvi on saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four traditionalist catholic bishops including one who denies the holocaust .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council .

williamson told swedish television in an interview broadcast a week ago : " i believe there were no gas chambers " and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than 6 million .
in germany where holocaust denial is a crime , public prosecutors have opened an investigation against williamson , who made the remarks to the swedish journalists during a visit to germany .
williamson himself seems to have realized that he was opening himself up for prosecution .
" be careful , i beg of you , this is against the law in germany , " williamson told the reporter at the end of the interview .
" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .
the catholic bishop of the southern german city of regensburg , which is also the home of base of pope benedict , said wednesday that williamson would not be allowed to set foot in his cathedral or on any other church property .
pope seeks to heal rift since the uproar caused by his decision to welcome williamson back into the catholic fold , pope benedict has sought to heal the rift with jews .
speaking at his weekly audience , he said the attempt to exterminate jews in the holocaust should remain a warning to all humanity .

williamson himself seems to have realized that he was opening himself up for prosecution .
" be careful , i beg of you , this is against the law in germany , " williamson told the reporter at the end of the interview .
" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .
the catholic bishop of the southern german city of regensburg , which is also the home of base of pope benedict , said wednesday that williamson would not be allowed to set foot in his cathedral or on any other church property .
pope seeks to heal rift since the uproar caused by his decision to welcome williamson back into the catholic fold , pope benedict has sought to heal the rift with jews .
speaking at his weekly audience , he said the attempt to exterminate jews in the holocaust should remain a warning to all humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has sought to reach out to jews following the controversy recalling his visit to the auschwitz death camp in 2006 , benedict condemned the " pitiless killing of millions of jews , innocent victims of blind racial and religious hatred . "
but knobloch on thursday said she did n't believe the pope 's move had been a spontaneous one .

the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in addition , hundreds of thousands of people marched in the streets in some 200 cities and towns to express their displeasure with the economic policies of president nicolas sarkozy and his government .
major trade unions called the strike to demand more job security , additional state aid to small and mid-sized companies threatened by the economic crisis and a halt to some of sarkozy 's economic reforms .
education ministry to cut jobs according to julien pons , a 28-year-old teacher protesting in paris , " the government wants to impose the logic of the private sector on the public sector .
so i am striking to protest the privatization of the public sector , stagnating salaries and the government 's plans to cut jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french education minister xavier darcos plans to cut 13,500 jobs education minister xavier darcos is planning to slash 13,500 jobs from the french education system in 2009 , a measure that unions say will severely impair the quality of education .
" there is a general disdain because it is impossible to have discussions with the government , " pons said .
the fsu trade union said that more than 60 percent of all primary and secondary schoolteachers were taking part in the strike .
the government 's figures were significantly lower .
rail workers kick off strike in addition , public transport in 77 cities and towns across france was disrupted to varying degrees on thursday , after employees of the state-owned sncf rail network kicked off the strike late wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train stations , like this one in paris , were empty on thursday the cgt union said 41 percent of railway employees were striking .
the sncf said about half of all scheduled high-speed tgv and regional trains were operating .
in the greater paris area , more than half of scheduled trains linking the capital with its suburbs were not in service thursday , while an average of about one of two scheduled metro trains were running in the city , the ratp transport system said .
however , there was none of the usual strike-day chaos because many employees stayed away from their jobs , either out of sympathy for the strike or to avoid spending long hours in transit .

organizers said that up to 300,000 people marched through the streets of marseille .
again , police estimates were much lower .
the extent of the strikes and the number of protesters in the streets will be closely watched , as they represent an important test of strength between unions and sarkozy .

especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .

there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.01.2009 table likely to change as bundesliga resumes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern celebrate again this year ?
the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

" i wish there 's a howl of protest in the church against the pope 's move , " knobloch told the paper .
" under the circumstances , i certainly ca n't at the moment continue talks with the church , " she said , adding however that the severance of talks was temporary .
jews angered by rehabilitation of holocaust-denier pope benedict xvi on saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four traditionalist catholic bishops including one who denies the holocaust .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's controversial comments have caused an uproar the rehabilitation of british-born richard williamson who has made statements denying the full extent of the holocaust of european jews has caused uproar among jewish leaders and progressive catholics , many of whom said it threatened 50 years of christian-jewish dialogue .
williamson told swedish television in an interview broadcast a week ago : " i believe there were no gas chambers " and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than 6 million .
in germany where holocaust denial is a crime , public prosecutors have opened an investigation against williamson , who made the remarks to the swedish journalists during a visit to germany .
williamson himself seems to have realized that he was opening himself up for prosecution .
" be careful , i beg of you , this is against the law in germany , " williamson told the reporter at the end of the interview .
" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .
the catholic bishop of the southern german city of regensburg , which is also the home of base of pope benedict , said wednesday that williamson would not be allowed to set foot in his cathedral or on any other church property .
pope seeks to heal rift since the uproar caused by his decision to welcome williamson back into the catholic fold , pope benedict has sought to heal the rift with jews .
speaking at his weekly audience , he said the attempt to exterminate jews in the holocaust should remain a warning to all humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has sought to reach out to jews following the controversy recalling his visit to the auschwitz death camp in 2006 , benedict condemned the " pitiless killing of millions of jews , innocent victims of blind racial and religious hatred . "
but knobloch on thursday said she did n't believe the pope 's move had been a spontaneous one .
" the pope is one of the most educated and intelligent persons the catholic church has .
he means every word that he says and each one is well-grounded , " she told the paper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the situation in many developing countries threatens to worsen dramatically this year , " the development minister said .
" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .
despite expressing concern at conferences , rich donor countries had only provided 25 percent of the promised funds to help the developing world combat poverty , he said .

29 , for talks focused mainly on the financial crisis and exports , but merkel did n't miss the opportunity to discuss tibet . germany 's chancellor angela merkel appealed thursday to chinese premier wen jiabao to resume beijing 's talks with envoys of the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader .
" germany has an intense interest in the talks with the dalai lama resuming , " merkel told reporters after initial discussions with wen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was very angry with germany when chancellor merkel met with the dalai lama in 2007 she said germany was willing to make a " constructive contribution " on the matter , adding that germany did not question the one-china policy .
about 50 tibetan demonstrators outside merkel 's office shouted and waved flags and placards as wen 's motorcade arrived for the ceremony .
they asked merkel to press wen to engage in full talks with the dalai lama .
relations between germany and china have improved since a spat in 2007 when merkel met the dalai lama , the exiled spiritual leader of tibet , at her office in berlin .
that meeting prompted beijing to suspend a " dialogue " with germany on the rule of law which only recently resumed .
the mood at thursday 's meeting was conciliatory .
the chinese premier said of his visit to the german capital , scheduled to last less than 20 hours , that the leaders " exchanged opinions in an open and honest atmosphere . "
wen described the thaw in relations saying , " after a cold winter , spring brings with it a relationship we can be proud of . "
improved economic relations wen told journalists there had been broad agreement in his talks with merkel and her ministers which dealt with the global economic slump and financial crisis . the two leaders said they agreed that protectionism must not be the answer to national economic troubles and pledged closer coordination on economic , trade , monetary and finance policy . the two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding on climate protection with greater cooperation on energy , research and technology . " my visit to germany puts me in a good mood , " wen told reporters . one of the technologies which china agreed to buy thursday was the german design work for the transrapid , a magnetic-levitation railway system which already operates in shanghai and which china aims to expand . " beijing wants to work with europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year sees tons of chinese goods arriving in the eu germany is the second stage of a european tour that took wen to switzerland and the world economic forum in davos .

earlier this week , wen said beijing is ready to work together with europe to restore confidence in the faltering global financial system .

" the situation in many developing countries threatens to worsen dramatically this year , " the development minister said .
" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .
despite expressing concern at conferences , rich donor countries had only provided 25 percent of the promised funds to help the developing world combat poverty , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in germany are split over the best use of development aid ute koczy , also from the green party , accused wieczorek-zeul for being partly responsible for the " wrong and catastrophic policy of eu subsidies . "

" the situation in many developing countries threatens to worsen dramatically this year , " the development minister said .
" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .
despite expressing concern at conferences , rich donor countries had only provided 25 percent of the promised funds to help the developing world combat poverty , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in germany are split over the best use of development aid ute koczy , also from the green party , accused wieczorek-zeul for being partly responsible for the " wrong and catastrophic policy of eu subsidies . "
the development expert of the opposition free liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , hellmut koenigshaus accused the government of splashing out more money for what he called " wrong development policies .

and their good example has rubbed off on their neighbors . what would germany be without beer and bratwurst ?
well , if the rate of beer consumption continues on its current trajectory , we may just find out .
beer consumption in germany , which once prided itself as a world champion of beer culture , has declined for yet another year as germans reach for a glass of fizzy water instead , national statistics issued thursday show .
domestic sales by the german breweries fell 0.9 percent last year to 8.7 billion liters , and exports were down even more sharply , the federal statistics office said .
eu nations took 1.1 billion liters , down 1.2 percent and non-eu nations 0.3 billion , down 4.1 percent .
the data released in wiesbaden did not cover soft drinks and mineral waters , but previous figures have shown sales of those beverages steadily rising while beer consumption falls back year by year .
if a new study comes out reporting that bratwurst consumption is also on the decline , germany might have to change its name to france and oktoberfest will have to be held in belgium . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in addition , hundreds of thousands of people marched in the streets in some 200 cities and towns to express their displeasure with the economic policies of president nicolas sarkozy and his government .
major trade unions called the strike to demand more job security , additional state aid to small and mid-sized companies threatened by the economic crisis and a halt to some of sarkozy 's economic reforms .
education ministry to cut jobs according to julien pons , a 28-year-old teacher protesting in paris , " the government wants to impose the logic of the private sector on the public sector .
so i am striking to protest the privatization of the public sector , stagnating salaries and the government 's plans to cut jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french education minister xavier darcos plans to cut 13,500 jobs education minister xavier darcos is planning to slash 13,500 jobs from the french education system in 2009 , a measure that unions say will severely impair the quality of education .
" there is a general disdain because it is impossible to have discussions with the government , " pons said .
the fsu trade union said that more than 60 percent of all primary and secondary schoolteachers were taking part in the strike .
the government 's figures were significantly lower .
rail workers kick off strike in addition , public transport in 77 cities and towns across france was disrupted to varying degrees on thursday , after employees of the state-owned sncf rail network kicked off the strike late wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train stations , like this one in paris , were empty on thursday the cgt union said 41 percent of railway employees were striking .
the sncf said about half of all scheduled high-speed tgv and regional trains were operating .
in the greater paris area , more than half of scheduled trains linking the capital with its suburbs were not in service thursday , while an average of about one of two scheduled metro trains were running in the city , the ratp transport system said .
however , there was none of the usual strike-day chaos because many employees stayed away from their jobs , either out of sympathy for the strike or to avoid spending long hours in transit .
litmus test for the government in the southern city of marseille , however , no metro trains were operating on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike organizers estimate around 300,000 people marched in marseille the head of the cfdt trade union , francois chereque , called the day 's street protests " the largest workers ' demonstration in france in 20 years . "
his counterpart from the cgt union , bernard thibault , said that by mid-day " 1 million people " had already taken part in protest marches .
organizers said that up to 300,000 people marched through the streets of marseille .
again , police estimates were much lower .
the extent of the strikes and the number of protesters in the streets will be closely watched , as they represent an important test of strength between unions and sarkozy .
union leaders have said that a successful strike day will embolden them to increase the pressure on the government through more labor actions . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had forecast that an additional 30,000 germans would be out of work .
in politically more important seasonally unadjusted terms , the number of people out of work surged by 387,000 to 3.489 million , pushing up the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent .
" the demand for labor fell strongly , " said german labor office chief frank-juergen weise .

but as 2008 drew to a close , the global slowdown began to tighten its grip on the german economy with both economists and the country 's labor office warning that joblessness in the country will rise in the coming months .
indeed , the new german jobless data follows a series of announcements by companies about plans for layoffs and production cuts as they face up to what is expected to be the biggest economic downturn since the end of the second world war .
on wednesday , europe 's biggest software manufacturer sap ag added its name to the list of companies cutting jobs when it announced that the global economic downturn had forced the german-based company to slash its workforce by about six percent or 3,000 jobs .

the unions said more than 200 rail personnel in munich and nuremberg stopped work while around 150 laid down their tools in cologne , disrupting train services on both regional and long-haul stretches .
according to deutsche bahn , the strikes delayed services between cologne and dusseldorf .
but the company said it would try to soften the strikes ' impact by pressing additional workers into service .
deutsche bahn began alerting passengers on wednesday to a disruption of services .
in hamburg , employees in the customer-service department stopped work for two hours , causing minor disruptions .
the strikes were also expected to be expanded to the cities of bremen , saalfeld , magdeburg and the capital berlin .
strikes meant as a " warning signal " the unions said the strikes were n't meant to cripple services but rather serve as a " warning signal . "
the two unions representing 130,000 railway staff are demanding a 10-percent pay increase and restrictions on night and weekend work .
deutsche bahn has proposed a 1 percent pay raise , but has promised to improve the offer .
business and employer representatives however urged the unions to avoid organizing strikes at a time when germany is in the grip of recession .

" i wish there 's a howl of protest in the church against the pope 's move , " knobloch told the paper .
" under the circumstances , i certainly ca n't at the moment continue talks with the church , " she said , adding however that the severance of talks was temporary .
jews angered by rehabilitation of holocaust-denier pope benedict xvi on saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four traditionalist catholic bishops including one who denies the holocaust .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's controversial comments have caused an uproar the rehabilitation of british-born richard williamson who has made statements denying the full extent of the holocaust of european jews has caused uproar among jewish leaders and progressive catholics , many of whom said it threatened 50 years of christian-jewish dialogue .
williamson told swedish television in an interview broadcast a week ago : " i believe there were no gas chambers " and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than 6 million .
in germany where holocaust denial is a crime , public prosecutors have opened an investigation against williamson , who made the remarks to the swedish journalists during a visit to germany .
williamson himself seems to have realized that he was opening himself up for prosecution .
" be careful , i beg of you , this is against the law in germany , " williamson told the reporter at the end of the interview .
" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .
the catholic bishop of the southern german city of regensburg , which is also the home of base of pope benedict , said wednesday that williamson would not be allowed to set foot in his cathedral or on any other church property .
pope seeks to heal rift since the uproar caused by his decision to welcome williamson back into the catholic fold , pope benedict has sought to heal the rift with jews .
speaking at his weekly audience , he said the attempt to exterminate jews in the holocaust should remain a warning to all humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has sought to reach out to jews following the controversy recalling his visit to the auschwitz death camp in 2006 , benedict condemned the " pitiless killing of millions of jews , innocent victims of blind racial and religious hatred . "
but knobloch on thursday said she did n't believe the pope 's move had been a spontaneous one .

" i wish there 's a howl of protest in the church against the pope 's move , " knobloch told the paper .
" under the circumstances , i certainly ca n't at the moment continue talks with the church , " she said , adding however that the severance of talks was temporary .
jews angered by rehabilitation of holocaust-denier pope benedict xvi on saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four traditionalist catholic bishops including one who denies the holocaust .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's controversial comments have caused an uproar the rehabilitation of british-born richard williamson who has made statements denying the full extent of the holocaust of european jews has caused uproar among jewish leaders and progressive catholics , many of whom said it threatened 50 years of christian-jewish dialogue .
williamson told swedish television in an interview broadcast a week ago : " i believe there were no gas chambers " and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than 6 million .
in germany where holocaust denial is a crime , public prosecutors have opened an investigation against williamson , who made the remarks to the swedish journalists during a visit to germany .
williamson himself seems to have realized that he was opening himself up for prosecution .
" be careful , i beg of you , this is against the law in germany , " williamson told the reporter at the end of the interview .
" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .
the catholic bishop of the southern german city of regensburg , which is also the home of base of pope benedict , said wednesday that williamson would not be allowed to set foot in his cathedral or on any other church property .
pope seeks to heal rift since the uproar caused by his decision to welcome williamson back into the catholic fold , pope benedict has sought to heal the rift with jews .
speaking at his weekly audience , he said the attempt to exterminate jews in the holocaust should remain a warning to all humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has sought to reach out to jews following the controversy recalling his visit to the auschwitz death camp in 2006 , benedict condemned the " pitiless killing of millions of jews , innocent victims of blind racial and religious hatred . "
but knobloch on thursday said she did n't believe the pope 's move had been a spontaneous one .
" the pope is one of the most educated and intelligent persons the catholic church has .
he means every word that he says and each one is well-grounded , " she told the paper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , that it vetted some 173,000 employees as part of an anti-corruption campaign .
politicians were shocked by the news . the revelations of the massive monitoring action and its dimensions contradict earlier statements by the national rail company about its controversial vetting actions .
last week , the company admitted it performed checks on more than 1,000 of its senior managers in a corruption probe , but denied spying on them . but on wednesday , deutsche bahn 's anti-corruption commissioner , wolfgang schaupensteiner , told the parliamentary committee meeting that the vetting , done without the knowledge of those being monitored , was much larger . more then two-thirds of the company 's employees were secretly screened for possible external business activities or links to suppliers , according to information provided by those present at the closed meeting . ' new dimension ' horst friedrich , the transportation expert of the the free-market liberal fdp party called it a " scandal of an entirely new dimension , " while the green party accused the company of a massive violation of the privacy of its employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's wolfgang schaupensteiner says there was nothing unlawful about the vetting program peter schaar , the federal data protection commissioner , said he was appalled by the high number of those who were investigated by the company .
" it is complete nonsense when every single conductor falls under general suspicion . " the screenings took place in 2002 and 2003 when data such as addresses , telephone numbers and banking information was compared with a list of 80,000 companies that do business with deutsche bahn .
according to those in the committee hearing , out of 173,000 reviews , 100 cases of impropriety turned up . for its part , deutsche bahn defended its actions , calling them lawful and proper . " contrary to many assertions , there is nothing wrong with comparing employee and supplier addresses , or so-called ' screening ' , regardless of the number of vetted employees , " said deutsche bahn spokesperson oliver schumacher . already under fire but just last week , deutsche bahn found itself under fire for its vetting program in 2002 and 2003 , which was uncovered by an article in the newsmagazine stern , which said the surveillance was conducted by network deutschland - the same company used by deutsche telekom to secretly monitor its workers . then , schaupensteiner accused the magazine of rehashing an old story that was based on information which he said deutsche bahn had already made public in june 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn was looking for clues to outside business activities or links to supplies " there have been no new cases since then , " spokesman wolfgang schaupensteiner said . the magazine report referred to two major surveillance operations conducted in 2002 and 2003 in which executives and their wives were vetted for possible external business activities or links to suppliers . he had said this was " a legitimate and necessary action in order to track down a potential conflict of interests , " adding it was not uncommon in major concerns for employees to set up their own companies and then " place orders with themselves . " the data protection watchdog , schaar , has demanded legal action be taken against the company the parliamentary transportation committee is to meet on feb .
11 and take up the matter again .
the committee gave schaupensteiner a list of 60 questions to answer and has said it wants to question two other deutsche bahn executives in charge of auditing and security . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in hamburg , employees in the customer-service department stopped work for two hours , causing minor disruptions .
the strikes were also expected to be expanded to the cities of bremen , saalfeld , magdeburg and the capital berlin .
strikes meant as a " warning signal " the unions said the strikes were n't meant to cripple services but rather serve as a " warning signal . "
the two unions representing 130,000 railway staff are demanding a 10-percent pay increase and restrictions on night and weekend work .
deutsche bahn has proposed a 1 percent pay raise , but has promised to improve the offer .
business and employer representatives however urged the unions to avoid organizing strikes at a time when germany is in the grip of recession .

analysts had forecast that an additional 30,000 germans would be out of work .
in politically more important seasonally unadjusted terms , the number of people out of work surged by 387,000 to 3.489 million , pushing up the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent .
" the demand for labor fell strongly , " said german labor office chief frank-juergen weise .
jobless data follows wave of layoffs german employment hit a record 40.3 million last year to reach the highest level since german unification in 1990 as solid economic growth and labor market reforms helped to boost hiring in recent years .
but as 2008 drew to a close , the global slowdown began to tighten its grip on the german economy with both economists and the country 's labor office warning that joblessness in the country will rise in the coming months .

and their good example has rubbed off on their neighbors . what would germany be without beer and bratwurst ?
well , if the rate of beer consumption continues on its current trajectory , we may just find out .
beer consumption in germany , which once prided itself as a world champion of beer culture , has declined for yet another year as germans reach for a glass of fizzy water instead , national statistics issued thursday show .
domestic sales by the german breweries fell 0.9 percent last year to 8.7 billion liters , and exports were down even more sharply , the federal statistics office said .
eu nations took 1.1 billion liters , down 1.2 percent and non-eu nations 0.3 billion , down 4.1 percent .
the data released in wiesbaden did not cover soft drinks and mineral waters , but previous figures have shown sales of those beverages steadily rising while beer consumption falls back year by year .
if a new study comes out reporting that bratwurst consumption is also on the decline , germany might have to change its name to france and oktoberfest will have to be held in belgium . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i wish there 's a howl of protest in the church against the pope 's move , " knobloch told the paper .
" under the circumstances , i certainly ca n't at the moment continue talks with the church , " she said , adding however that the severance of talks was temporary .
jews angered by rehabilitation of holocaust-denier pope benedict xvi on saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four traditionalist catholic bishops including one who denies the holocaust .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's controversial comments have caused an uproar the rehabilitation of british-born richard williamson who has made statements denying the full extent of the holocaust of european jews has caused uproar among jewish leaders and progressive catholics , many of whom said it threatened 50 years of christian-jewish dialogue .
williamson told swedish television in an interview broadcast a week ago : " i believe there were no gas chambers " and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than 6 million .
in germany where holocaust denial is a crime , public prosecutors have opened an investigation against williamson , who made the remarks to the swedish journalists during a visit to germany .
williamson himself seems to have realized that he was opening himself up for prosecution .
" be careful , i beg of you , this is against the law in germany , " williamson told the reporter at the end of the interview .
" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .
the catholic bishop of the southern german city of regensburg , which is also the home of base of pope benedict , said wednesday that williamson would not be allowed to set foot in his cathedral or on any other church property .
pope seeks to heal rift since the uproar caused by his decision to welcome williamson back into the catholic fold , pope benedict has sought to heal the rift with jews .
speaking at his weekly audience , he said the attempt to exterminate jews in the holocaust should remain a warning to all humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has sought to reach out to jews following the controversy recalling his visit to the auschwitz death camp in 2006 , benedict condemned the " pitiless killing of millions of jews , innocent victims of blind racial and religious hatred . "
but knobloch on thursday said she did n't believe the pope 's move had been a spontaneous one .

the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in addition , hundreds of thousands of people marched in the streets in some 200 cities and towns to express their displeasure with the economic policies of president nicolas sarkozy and his government .
major trade unions called the strike to demand more job security , additional state aid to small and mid-sized companies threatened by the economic crisis and a halt to some of sarkozy 's economic reforms .
education ministry to cut jobs according to julien pons , a 28-year-old teacher protesting in paris , " the government wants to impose the logic of the private sector on the public sector .
so i am striking to protest the privatization of the public sector , stagnating salaries and the government 's plans to cut jobs . "

" there is a general disdain because it is impossible to have discussions with the government , " pons said .
the fsu trade union said that more than 60 percent of all primary and secondary schoolteachers were taking part in the strike .
the government 's figures were significantly lower .
rail workers kick off strike in addition , public transport in 77 cities and towns across france was disrupted to varying degrees on thursday , after employees of the state-owned sncf rail network kicked off the strike late wednesday .

the sncf said about half of all scheduled high-speed tgv and regional trains were operating .
in the greater paris area , more than half of scheduled trains linking the capital with its suburbs were not in service thursday , while an average of about one of two scheduled metro trains were running in the city , the ratp transport system said .
however , there was none of the usual strike-day chaos because many employees stayed away from their jobs , either out of sympathy for the strike or to avoid spending long hours in transit .

in addition , hundreds of thousands of people marched in the streets in some 200 cities and towns to express their displeasure with the economic policies of president nicolas sarkozy and his government .
major trade unions called the strike to demand more job security , additional state aid to small and mid-sized companies threatened by the economic crisis and a halt to some of sarkozy 's economic reforms .

the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .

boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .

the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .

in addition , hundreds of thousands of people marched in the streets in some 200 cities and towns to express their displeasure with the economic policies of president nicolas sarkozy and his government .
major trade unions called the strike to demand more job security , additional state aid to small and mid-sized companies threatened by the economic crisis and a halt to some of sarkozy 's economic reforms .
education ministry to cut jobs according to julien pons , a 28-year-old teacher protesting in paris , " the government wants to impose the logic of the private sector on the public sector .
so i am striking to protest the privatization of the public sector , stagnating salaries and the government 's plans to cut jobs . "

" there is a general disdain because it is impossible to have discussions with the government , " pons said .
the fsu trade union said that more than 60 percent of all primary and secondary schoolteachers were taking part in the strike .
the government 's figures were significantly lower .
rail workers kick off strike in addition , public transport in 77 cities and towns across france was disrupted to varying degrees on thursday , after employees of the state-owned sncf rail network kicked off the strike late wednesday .

the sncf said about half of all scheduled high-speed tgv and regional trains were operating .

however , there was none of the usual strike-day chaos because many employees stayed away from their jobs , either out of sympathy for the strike or to avoid spending long hours in transit .
litmus test for the government in the southern city of marseille , however , no metro trains were operating on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike organizers estimate around 300,000 people marched in marseille the head of the cfdt trade union , francois chereque , called the day 's street protests " the largest workers ' demonstration in france in 20 years . "

organizers said that up to 300,000 people marched through the streets of marseille .
again , police estimates were much lower .
the extent of the strikes and the number of protesters in the streets will be closely watched , as they represent an important test of strength between unions and sarkozy .
union leaders have said that a successful strike day will embolden them to increase the pressure on the government through more labor actions . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , that it vetted some 173,000 employees as part of an anti-corruption campaign .
politicians were shocked by the news . the revelations of the massive monitoring action and its dimensions contradict earlier statements by the national rail company about its controversial vetting actions .
last week , the company admitted it performed checks on more than 1,000 of its senior managers in a corruption probe , but denied spying on them . but on wednesday , deutsche bahn 's anti-corruption commissioner , wolfgang schaupensteiner , told the parliamentary committee meeting that the vetting , done without the knowledge of those being monitored , was much larger . more then two-thirds of the company 's employees were secretly screened for possible external business activities or links to suppliers , according to information provided by those present at the closed meeting . ' new dimension ' horst friedrich , the transportation expert of the the free-market liberal fdp party called it a " scandal of an entirely new dimension , " while the green party accused the company of a massive violation of the privacy of its employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's wolfgang schaupensteiner says there was nothing unlawful about the vetting program peter schaar , the federal data protection commissioner , said he was appalled by the high number of those who were investigated by the company .

" contrary to many assertions , there is nothing wrong with comparing employee and supplier addresses , or so-called ' screening ' , regardless of the number of vetted employees , " said deutsche bahn spokesperson oliver schumacher . already under fire but just last week , deutsche bahn found itself under fire for its vetting program in 2002 and 2003 , which was uncovered by an article in the newsmagazine stern , which said the surveillance was conducted by network deutschland - the same company used by deutsche telekom to secretly monitor its workers . then , schaupensteiner accused the magazine of rehashing an old story that was based on information which he said deutsche bahn had already made public in june 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn was looking for clues to outside business activities or links to supplies " there have been no new cases since then , " spokesman wolfgang schaupensteiner said . the magazine report referred to two major surveillance operations conducted in 2002 and 2003 in which executives and their wives were vetted for possible external business activities or links to suppliers . he had said this was " a legitimate and necessary action in order to track down a potential conflict of interests , " adding it was not uncommon in major concerns for employees to set up their own companies and then " place orders with themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .

that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .

williamson told swedish television in an interview broadcast a week ago : " i believe there were no gas chambers " and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than 6 million .

" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .

the unions said more than 200 rail personnel in munich and nuremberg stopped work while around 150 laid down their tools in cologne , disrupting train services on both regional and long-haul stretches .
according to deutsche bahn , the strikes delayed services between cologne and dusseldorf .
but the company said it would try to soften the strikes ' impact by pressing additional workers into service .
deutsche bahn began alerting passengers on wednesday to a disruption of services .
in hamburg , employees in the customer-service department stopped work for two hours , causing minor disruptions .
the strikes were also expected to be expanded to the cities of bremen , saalfeld , magdeburg and the capital berlin .
strikes meant as a " warning signal " the unions said the strikes were n't meant to cripple services but rather serve as a " warning signal . "
the two unions representing 130,000 railway staff are demanding a 10-percent pay increase and restrictions on night and weekend work .
deutsche bahn has proposed a 1 percent pay raise , but has promised to improve the offer .
business and employer representatives however urged the unions to avoid organizing strikes at a time when germany is in the grip of recession .

analysts had forecast that an additional 30,000 germans would be out of work .
in politically more important seasonally unadjusted terms , the number of people out of work surged by 387,000 to 3.489 million , pushing up the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent .
" the demand for labor fell strongly , " said german labor office chief frank-juergen weise .

well , if the rate of beer consumption continues on its current trajectory , we may just find out .
beer consumption in germany , which once prided itself as a world champion of beer culture , has declined for yet another year as germans reach for a glass of fizzy water instead , national statistics issued thursday show .
domestic sales by the german breweries fell 0.9 percent last year to 8.7 billion liters , and exports were down even more sharply , the federal statistics office said .
eu nations took 1.1 billion liters , down 1.2 percent and non-eu nations 0.3 billion , down 4.1 percent .
the data released in wiesbaden did not cover soft drinks and mineral waters , but previous figures have shown sales of those beverages steadily rising while beer consumption falls back year by year .
if a new study comes out reporting that bratwurst consumption is also on the decline , germany might have to change its name to france and oktoberfest will have to be held in belgium . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the situation in many developing countries threatens to worsen dramatically this year , " the development minister said .
" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .
despite expressing concern at conferences , rich donor countries had only provided 25 percent of the promised funds to help the developing world combat poverty , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in germany are split over the best use of development aid ute koczy , also from the green party , accused wieczorek-zeul for being partly responsible for the " wrong and catastrophic policy of eu subsidies . "

29 , for talks focused mainly on the financial crisis and exports , but merkel did n't miss the opportunity to discuss tibet . germany 's chancellor angela merkel appealed thursday to chinese premier wen jiabao to resume beijing 's talks with envoys of the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader .
" germany has an intense interest in the talks with the dalai lama resuming , " merkel told reporters after initial discussions with wen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was very angry with germany when chancellor merkel met with the dalai lama in 2007 she said germany was willing to make a " constructive contribution " on the matter , adding that germany did not question the one-china policy .
about 50 tibetan demonstrators outside merkel 's office shouted and waved flags and placards as wen 's motorcade arrived for the ceremony .
they asked merkel to press wen to engage in full talks with the dalai lama .
relations between germany and china have improved since a spat in 2007 when merkel met the dalai lama , the exiled spiritual leader of tibet , at her office in berlin .

wen described the thaw in relations saying , " after a cold winter , spring brings with it a relationship we can be proud of . "
improved economic relations wen told journalists there had been broad agreement in his talks with merkel and her ministers which dealt with the global economic slump and financial crisis . the two leaders said they agreed that protectionism must not be the answer to national economic troubles and pledged closer coordination on economic , trade , monetary and finance policy . the two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding on climate protection with greater cooperation on energy , research and technology . " my visit to germany puts me in a good mood , " wen told reporters . one of the technologies which china agreed to buy thursday was the german design work for the transrapid , a magnetic-levitation railway system which already operates in shanghai and which china aims to expand .

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .
26 .
according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .

according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "

in addition , hundreds of thousands of people marched in the streets in some 200 cities and towns to express their displeasure with the economic policies of president nicolas sarkozy and his government .
major trade unions called the strike to demand more job security , additional state aid to small and mid-sized companies threatened by the economic crisis and a halt to some of sarkozy 's economic reforms .

in the greater paris area , more than half of scheduled trains linking the capital with its suburbs were not in service thursday , while an average of about one of two scheduled metro trains were running in the city , the ratp transport system said .
however , there was none of the usual strike-day chaos because many employees stayed away from their jobs , either out of sympathy for the strike or to avoid spending long hours in transit .

organizers said that up to 300,000 people marched through the streets of marseille .
again , police estimates were much lower .
the extent of the strikes and the number of protesters in the streets will be closely watched , as they represent an important test of strength between unions and sarkozy .

the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.01.2009 opinion : obama 's promising mideast beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mitchell mideast mission , us president obama 's offer to talk with iran as well as ahmadinejad 's positive reaction are a sign of hope for the region , says dw 's peter philipp . washington 's new tone is getting an initially positive - even if partially cautious - reaction in the near and middle east .
especially in iran : president mahmoud ahmadinejad promptly reacted to us president barack obama 's renewed announcement that he 's ready to engage with tehran directly .
ahmadinejad said that he welcomed the will to change , but that it remains to be seen whether this is real policy or simply political tactics .
by doing so , the iranian president for his part has opened to door to an iranian-american dialog - at least a little bit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp thirty years after the islamic revolution , even iranian hardliners seem to have realized that dialog is better than confrontation - or at least that diplomacy is better than policies of mutual demonization and accusations that 's practiced all too often .
it would have been extremely foolish to slam the door in obama 's face .
many , however , had expected exactly this from ahmadinejad , the west 's favorite bogeyman .
still , it 's hardly surprising that the iranian president presents his conditions for a dialog with washington : the us have to apologize for their " past crimes " against iran , they should withdraw their troops that are stationed around the globe and stop getting involved in everything .
they should end their support for israel .
serious american experts on iran have long argued that washington should apologize for the cia-backed putsch of 1953 - as well as us support for saddam hussein at the beginning of the first gulf war .
only such a gesture could help to improve the climate of mutual relations .
as far as the withdrawal from iraq is concerned , obama hardly needs ahmadinejad 's call for action .
it 's also unlikely that he plans to stay in afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary - whatever this may mean in the end .
in the case of israel , the iranian president 's demand will fall on deaf ears in the " new washington . "
the us-israeli relationship certainly wo n't be sacrificed for the sake of a rapprochement between washington and tehran .
but even in this area a slow change is possible .
the first trip of the new middle east envoy , george mitchell , has at least been welcomed by the arab side as it shows that the new us president is really interested in solving the pressing problems .
that 's why not only egyptians , but also hamas spokesmen welcomed the mitchell mission as a positive step .
hamas spokesmen only regretted that washington still is n't willing to talk to them .
in israel on the other hand , it 's hard to ignore the underlying feeling - despite all the friendly words - that the " golden times " of unconditional support by george w. bush 's washington are a thing of the past .
true : it 's impossible to glean groundbreaking policies from these first steps .
but - and this is the most astounding thing of all - one could almost learn a lesson from ahmadinejad 's reaction - with the noted exception of his unchanging hostile approach towards israel .
there are times when you have to set aside anger , bitterness and the dreams of the past to reach a better future .
this does not have to result in self-abandonment .
needless to say , everyone can enter a dialog with his views and demands .
but these can not be insurmountable conditions and they can not aim to destroy or completely demean the other side .
hamas and israel can learn from this , as can the us and iran .
as far as washington and tehran are concerned , the ball seems to have been skillfully lobbed back into the americans ' court .

" i wish there 's a howl of protest in the church against the pope 's move , " knobloch told the paper .
" under the circumstances , i certainly ca n't at the moment continue talks with the church , " she said , adding however that the severance of talks was temporary .
jews angered by rehabilitation of holocaust-denier pope benedict xvi on saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four traditionalist catholic bishops including one who denies the holocaust .
the four men ran the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , an ultra-traditionalist catholic group that broke with rome over reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williamson 's controversial comments have caused an uproar the rehabilitation of british-born richard williamson who has made statements denying the full extent of the holocaust of european jews has caused uproar among jewish leaders and progressive catholics , many of whom said it threatened 50 years of christian-jewish dialogue .
williamson told swedish television in an interview broadcast a week ago : " i believe there were no gas chambers " and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than 6 million .
in germany where holocaust denial is a crime , public prosecutors have opened an investigation against williamson , who made the remarks to the swedish journalists during a visit to germany .
williamson himself seems to have realized that he was opening himself up for prosecution .
" be careful , i beg of you , this is against the law in germany , " williamson told the reporter at the end of the interview .
" you could have me thrown in prison before i leave germany .
i hope that 's not your intention . "
the german conference of catholic bishops has strongly rejected williamson 's remarks .
the catholic bishop of the southern german city of regensburg , which is also the home of base of pope benedict , said wednesday that williamson would not be allowed to set foot in his cathedral or on any other church property .
pope seeks to heal rift since the uproar caused by his decision to welcome williamson back into the catholic fold , pope benedict has sought to heal the rift with jews .
speaking at his weekly audience , he said the attempt to exterminate jews in the holocaust should remain a warning to all humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict has sought to reach out to jews following the controversy recalling his visit to the auschwitz death camp in 2006 , benedict condemned the " pitiless killing of millions of jews , innocent victims of blind racial and religious hatred . "
but knobloch on thursday said she did n't believe the pope 's move had been a spontaneous one .
" the pope is one of the most educated and intelligent persons the catholic church has .
he means every word that he says and each one is well-grounded , " she told the paper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .
26 .
according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "
the cia rendition flights took suspected terrorists captured in one country to another or a us-run detention center for questioning and , as many allege , torture .
the program began after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .

boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .
26 .
according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "
the cia rendition flights took suspected terrorists captured in one country to another or a us-run detention center for questioning and , as many allege , torture .

29 , for talks focused mainly on the financial crisis and exports , but merkel did n't miss the opportunity to discuss tibet . germany 's chancellor angela merkel appealed thursday to chinese premier wen jiabao to resume beijing 's talks with envoys of the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader . " germany has an intense interest in the talks with the dalai lama resuming , " merkel told reporters after initial discussions with wen . she said germany was willing to make a " constructive contribution " on the matter , adding that germany did not question the one-china policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was very angry with germany when chancellor merkel met with the dalai lama in 2007 about 60 tibetan demonstrators outside merkel 's office shouted and waved flags and placards as wen 's motorcade arrived for the ceremony .
they asked merkel to press wen to engage in full talks with the dalai lama . relations between germany and china have improved since a spat in 2007 when merkel met the dalai lama , the exiled spiritual leader of tibet , at her office in berlin .
that meeting prompted beijing to suspend a " dialogue " with germany on the rule of law which only recently resumed . improved economic relations wen told journalists there had been broad agreement in his talks with merkel and her ministers which dealt with the global economic slump and financial crisis . the two leaders said they agreed that protectionism must not be the answer to national economic troubles and pledged closer coordination on economic , trade , monetary and finance policy .
the two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding on climate protection with greater cooperation on energy , research and technology .
" my visit to germany puts me in a good mood , " wen told reporters . one of the technologies which china agreed to buy thursday was the german design work for the transrapid , a magnetic-levitation railway system which already operates in shanghai and which china aims to expand . minister praises progress on human rights the chancellor held talks with the chinese premier when she visited china in october last year to take part in the biannual asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year sees tons of chinese goods arriving in the eu on wednesday , germany 's justice minister praised beijing 's " irreversible " progress on human rights and the rule of law . " the chinese are taking their own path , their so-called chinese third way .

politicians were shocked by the news . the revelations of the massive monitoring action and its dimensions contradict earlier statements by the national rail company about its controversial vetting actions .
last week , the company admitted it performed checks on more than 1,000 of its senior managers in a corruption probe , but denied spying on them . but on wednesday , deutsche bahn 's anti-corruption commissioner , wolfgang schaupensteiner , told the parliamentary committee meeting that the vetting , done without the knowledge of those being monitored , was much larger . more then two-thirds of the company 's employees were secretly screened for possible external business activities or links to suppliers , according to information provided by those present at the closed meeting .

analysts had forecast that an additional 30,000 germans would be out of work .
in politically more important seasonally unadjusted terms , the number of people out of work surged by 387,000 to 3.489 million , pushing up the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent .
" the demand for labor fell strongly , " said german labor office chief frank-juergen weise .

29 , for talks focused mainly on the financial crisis and exports , but merkel did n't miss the opportunity to discuss tibet . germany 's chancellor angela merkel appealed thursday to chinese premier wen jiabao to resume beijing 's talks with envoys of the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader . " germany has an intense interest in the talks with the dalai lama resuming , " merkel told reporters after initial discussions with wen . she said germany was willing to make a " constructive contribution " on the matter , adding that germany did not question the one-china policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was very angry with germany when chancellor merkel met with the dalai lama in 2007 about 60 tibetan demonstrators outside merkel 's office shouted and waved flags and placards as wen 's motorcade arrived for the ceremony .
they asked merkel to press wen to engage in full talks with the dalai lama . relations between germany and china have improved since a spat in 2007 when merkel met the dalai lama , the exiled spiritual leader of tibet , at her office in berlin .
that meeting prompted beijing to suspend a " dialogue " with germany on the rule of law which only recently resumed . improved economic relations wen told journalists there had been broad agreement in his talks with merkel and her ministers which dealt with the global economic slump and financial crisis . the two leaders said they agreed that protectionism must not be the answer to national economic troubles and pledged closer coordination on economic , trade , monetary and finance policy .
the two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding on climate protection with greater cooperation on energy , research and technology .

" i believe that -lrb- this progress -rrb- is irreversible for china , " she added . " beijing wants to work with europe " germany is the second stage of a european tour that took wen to switzerland and the world economic forum in davos . this week , wen is also scheduled to visit spain and britain . on friday , he will head a high-level chinese delegation to brussels to meet european commission president jose manuel barroso and other eu commissioners in a bid to heal strained political ties with the 27-nation bloc . earlier this week , wen said beijing is ready to work together with europe to restore confidence in the faltering global financial system . both china and the eu are heavily reliant on each other for trade , business and investment .

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .
26 .
according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "
the cia rendition flights took suspected terrorists captured in one country to another or a us-run detention center for questioning and , as many allege , torture .
the program began after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to those in the committee hearing , out of 173,000 reviews , 100 cases of impropriety turned up . for its part , deutsche bahn defended its actions , calling them lawful and proper . " contrary to many assertions , there is nothing wrong with comparing employee and supplier addresses , or so-called ' screening ' , regardless of the number of vetted employees , " said deutsche bahn spokesperson oliver schumacher . already under fire but just last week , deutsche bahn found itself under fire for its vetting program in 2002 and 2003 , which was uncovered by an article in the newsmagazine stern , which said the surveillance was conducted by network deutschland - the same company used by deutsche telekom to secretly monitor its workers . then , schaupensteiner accused the magazine of rehashing an old story that was based on information which he said deutsche bahn had already made public in june 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn was looking for clues to outside business activities or links to supplies " there have been no new cases since then , " spokesman wolfgang schaupensteiner said . the magazine report referred to two major surveillance operations conducted in 2002 and 2003 in which executives and their wives were vetted for possible external business activities or links to suppliers . he had said this was " a legitimate and necessary action in order to track down a potential conflict of interests , " adding it was not uncommon in major concerns for employees to set up their own companies and then " place orders with themselves .

the league reboots on friday , jan.30 , when hamburg host bayern .
with only three points separating the top five , the second half of the season will feature a lot of flux .
dw predicts who will end up on top and on bottom . the title contenders at league leaders hoffenheim , their worst-case scenario became reality when league-leading striker vedad ibisevic suffered a season-ending knee injury .
boubacar sanogo , who 's been brought in on loan from bremen , is probably the best replacement hoffenheim could find on short notice , but they still start 2009 with personnel problems .
a realistic aim for them would be to stay in the top five , but they 'll need to hit the ground running against cottbus on saturday to have a chance .
the main profiteers from hoffenheim 's bad luck are , of course , bayern munich .
with by far and away the deepest squad in the league , bayern should cruise to yet another title - especially as their form improved consistently throughout the first half of the season .
the only potential roadblock would be an injury to playmaker and sole source of midfield genius franck ribery .
without him in the starting line-up , munich have sputtered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero is the anchor of berlin 's efficient midfield is it luck or efficiency ?
hertha berlin begin in third after pulling out a number of tight wins in 2008 .
most commentators think they 're ready for a precipitous fall , but coach lucien favre has assembled a deep and unpredictable squad - especially in midfield .
veteran fullback-midfielder marko babic should also fill an offensive hole on the left side so hertha will stay in the hunt for the top five .
fourth-placed hamburg turned the biggest deal of the winter break , selling midfielder nigel de jong to premiership side manchester city for a jaw-dropping 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- .
with money like that on the table , the northern german club had no choice , but they may have mortgaged their chances of qualifying for international competition this season .
a last-minute investment , though , could put them back in the picture .
bildunterschrift : leverkusen look like a good bet to improve leverkusen probably spent the break asking themselves how they ended up as low as fifth .
next to hoffenheim , coach bruno labbadia 's side played the most attractive football of the season 's first half .
but they foolishly squandered points against sides -lrb- hertha , karlsruhe , cottbus -rrb- , they had on the ropes .
if leverkusen learns to put matches away , they 're the only side with the talent to mount a credible challenge to bayern .
teams on the cusp dortmund have only lost one of their last 10 league games , which would seem to suggest they 're on a roll .
but they also had five draws in that period , and their schedule is seriously front-loaded .
they play leverkusen , bayern , schalke , hoffenheim , stuttgart and bremen before the end of march .
still , if dortmund can survive those foes , and new addition kevin-prince boateng provides some needed midfield creativity , this once great club could return to the top five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi is slowly imploding logic would dictate that schalke , which spent the most money putting together their 2008-9 squad , should be a lot better than seventh .
but what 's ever logical about schalke ?
the team lacks leadership , and its scattershot offense is too dependent on kevin kuranyi , who 's rapidly becoming a basket case .
solid defense keeps schalke competitive against most opponents , and an early winning streak could see them challenge for the top three .
but it 's equally likely that things will get very , very ugly in gelsenkirchen .
one golden rule of the bundesliga is : never count out werder bremen .
coach thomas schaaf 's all-or-nothing offensive approach means that the team came go on a tear at any point .
but this season , bremen have torn themselves apart with suspensions and defensive lapses - their longest league winning streak is two games .
werder being werder , expect them either to storm back and claim a champions league spot or flail their way down to the bottom half of the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chemistry is fine at wolfsburg with solid and occasionally inspired players from front to back , wolfsburg have all the pieces needed to establish themselves in the top five and begin pressuring the top three .
their shortcoming this season has been their inability to come up with the goods away from home - they 're still searching for their first away win .
if they can get that monkey off their back against cologne on saturday , the wolves will begin a steady rise .
stuttgart have one main reason for optimism .
striker mario gomez has reconciled himself to the idea of staying with the club after a long flirtation with bayern , during which he appeared to be playing only to avoid injury .
but the 2006-7 champs are seven points adrift of fifth place , so everything would have to break their way for them to qualify for the uefa cup .
and 2009 did n't start well .
stuttgart got hammered 5-1 at home by bayern in the german cup .
the relegation candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld should win the relegation fight against teams like gladbach of the five teams in the most acute danger of going down , bielefeld and karlsruhe have done just enough this winter to survive in the spring .
vlad munteanu should take some of the offensive pressure off striker artur wichniarek at bielefeld , while giovanni federico is likely to help karlsruhe 's midfield cohere .
so the bottom three are … cottbus have done nothing to address their biggest flaw , the league 's worst offense .
chemistry is also poor , with the team 's most talented striker dimitar rangelov wanting out and badly .
still , the tiny eastern german club may be able to claw its way into the relegation play-off .
meanwhile , bochum remain weak at the back , and their only big signing as of this writing , over-the-hill striker diego klimowicz , is n't likely to help that department much .
but who could ?
according to a recent poll , bochum 's fans opined that even lionel messi would n't be enough to keep the club , which has only one win this season , in the first division .
they probably were n't joking .
mönchengladbach , on the other hand , have replaced half their squad .
the problem is that the new additions - most notably paul stalteri and tomas galasek - are long in the tooth , and they wo n't have much time to gel .
gladbach 's first three matches are against tough opponents , and by the time they get some easier foes , they 'll probably be too far behind to rescue themselves . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 50 tibetan demonstrators outside merkel 's office shouted and waved flags and placards as wen 's motorcade arrived for the ceremony .
they asked merkel to press wen to engage in full talks with the dalai lama .
relations between germany and china have improved since a spat in 2007 when merkel met the dalai lama , the exiled spiritual leader of tibet , at her office in berlin .
that meeting prompted beijing to suspend a " dialogue " with germany on the rule of law which only recently resumed .
the mood at thursday 's meeting was conciliatory .
the chinese premier said of his visit to the german capital , scheduled to last less than 20 hours , that the leaders " exchanged opinions in an open and honest atmosphere . "
wen described the thaw in relations saying , " after a cold winter , spring brings with it a relationship we can be proud of . "
improved economic relations wen told journalists there had been broad agreement in his talks with merkel and her ministers which dealt with the global economic slump and financial crisis . the two leaders said they agreed that protectionism must not be the answer to national economic troubles and pledged closer coordination on economic , trade , monetary and finance policy . the two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding on climate protection with greater cooperation on energy , research and technology . " my visit to germany puts me in a good mood , " wen told reporters . one of the technologies which china agreed to buy thursday was the german design work for the transrapid , a magnetic-levitation railway system which already operates in shanghai and which china aims to expand .

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .
26 .
according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "
the cia rendition flights took suspected terrorists captured in one country to another or a us-run detention center for questioning and , as many allege , torture .

and their good example has rubbed off on their neighbors . what would germany be without beer and bratwurst ?
well , if the rate of beer consumption continues on its current trajectory , we may just find out .
beer consumption in germany , which once prided itself as a world champion of beer culture , has declined for yet another year as germans reach for a glass of fizzy water instead , national statistics issued thursday show .
domestic sales by the german breweries fell 0.9 percent last year to 8.7 billion liters , and exports were down even more sharply , the federal statistics office said .
eu nations took 1.1 billion liters , down 1.2 percent and non-eu nations 0.3 billion , down 4.1 percent .
the data released in wiesbaden did not cover soft drinks and mineral waters , but previous figures have shown sales of those beverages steadily rising while beer consumption falls back year by year .
if a new study comes out reporting that bratwurst consumption is also on the decline , germany might have to change its name to france and oktoberfest will have to be held in belgium . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the situation in many developing countries threatens to worsen dramatically this year , " the development minister said .
" for every percentage point that developing economies fail to grow , around 20 million people are sent back into poverty , " she said .
the minister , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the global slowdown had already put a squeeze on the developing world by crippling their exports and threatening further infrastructure expansion .
she warned that the financial storm posed a particular threat to the weakest sections in those countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul warned that the poor stand to lose the most from the global financial crisis " these people are n't shareholders .
they do n't pay for the collapse of the system with money but with the hard currency of their threatened daily existence , " she said .
wieczorek-zeul said more than a billion people around the world were already going hungry .
" there 's a danger that the crisis in a continent like africa would develop into a catastrophe with thousands of deaths . "
global investment package for poor the german government this year raised its development aid budget to 5.8 billion euros - an increase of 12 percent from last year .
in addition , a second economic stimulus package agreed upon by chancellor angela merkel 's government this week has earmarked 100 million euros as development aid .
that money is meant to finance world bank infrastructure projects .
wieczorek-zeul defended the measure , saying the funds would be used to secure existing projects in developing nations as well as finance new construction .
" that would be in our own interest , " the minister said .
" that 's because we can only get out of the crisis together . "
wieczorek-zeul called for a " new global investment program for the poorest in the world " in order to achieve un millennium development goals which foresee halving global poverty by 2015 and preventing the spread of aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
the minister said germany was sticking to its promise of raising its development aid budget to 0.51 percent of gdp by 2010 and to 0.7 percent by 2015 .
a waste of money ?
but some critics said that commitment fell far short of what was actually needed to tackle poverty and hunger .
thilo hoppe , development expert of the opposition green party spoke of a " major failure " in the fight against hunger .
despite expressing concern at conferences , rich donor countries had only provided 25 percent of the promised funds to help the developing world combat poverty , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in germany are split over the best use of development aid ute koczy , also from the green party , accused wieczorek-zeul for being partly responsible for the " wrong and catastrophic policy of eu subsidies . "

28 , that it vetted some 173,000 employees as part of an anti-corruption campaign .
politicians were shocked by the news . the revelations of the massive monitoring action and its dimensions contradict earlier statements by the national rail company about its controversial vetting actions .
last week , the company admitted it performed checks on more than 1,000 of its senior managers in a corruption probe , but denied spying on them . but on wednesday , deutsche bahn 's anti-corruption commissioner , wolfgang schaupensteiner , told the parliamentary committee meeting that the vetting , done without the knowledge of those being monitored , was much larger . more then two-thirds of the company 's employees were secretly screened for possible external business activities or links to suppliers , according to information provided by those present at the closed meeting . ' new dimension ' horst friedrich , the transportation expert of the the free-market liberal fdp party called it a " scandal of an entirely new dimension , " while the green party accused the company of a massive violation of the privacy of its employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn 's wolfgang schaupensteiner says there was nothing unlawful about the vetting program peter schaar , the federal data protection commissioner , said he was appalled by the high number of those who were investigated by the company .
" it is complete nonsense when every single conductor falls under general suspicion . " the screenings took place in 2002 and 2003 when data such as addresses , telephone numbers and banking information was compared with a list of 80,000 companies that do business with deutsche bahn .
according to those in the committee hearing , out of 173,000 reviews , 100 cases of impropriety turned up . for its part , deutsche bahn defended its actions , calling them lawful and proper . " contrary to many assertions , there is nothing wrong with comparing employee and supplier addresses , or so-called ' screening ' , regardless of the number of vetted employees , " said deutsche bahn spokesperson oliver schumacher . already under fire but just last week , deutsche bahn found itself under fire for its vetting program in 2002 and 2003 , which was uncovered by an article in the newsmagazine stern , which said the surveillance was conducted by network deutschland - the same company used by deutsche telekom to secretly monitor its workers . then , schaupensteiner accused the magazine of rehashing an old story that was based on information which he said deutsche bahn had already made public in june 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn was looking for clues to outside business activities or links to supplies " there have been no new cases since then , " spokesman wolfgang schaupensteiner said . the magazine report referred to two major surveillance operations conducted in 2002 and 2003 in which executives and their wives were vetted for possible external business activities or links to suppliers . he had said this was " a legitimate and necessary action in order to track down a potential conflict of interests , " adding it was not uncommon in major concerns for employees to set up their own companies and then " place orders with themselves . " the data protection watchdog , schaar , has demanded legal action be taken against the company the parliamentary transportation committee is to meet on feb .
11 and take up the matter again .
the committee gave schaupensteiner a list of 60 questions to answer and has said it wants to question two other deutsche bahn executives in charge of auditing and security . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .
26 .
according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "
the cia rendition flights took suspected terrorists captured in one country to another or a us-run detention center for questioning and , as many allege , torture .

29 , for talks focused mainly on the financial crisis and exports , but merkel did n't miss the opportunity to discuss tibet . germany 's chancellor angela merkel appealed thursday to chinese premier wen jiabao to resume beijing 's talks with envoys of the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader .
" germany has an intense interest in the talks with the dalai lama resuming , " merkel told reporters after initial discussions with wen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was very angry with germany when chancellor merkel met with the dalai lama in 2007 she said germany was willing to make a " constructive contribution " on the matter , adding that germany did not question the one-china policy .
about 50 tibetan demonstrators outside merkel 's office shouted and waved flags and placards as wen 's motorcade arrived for the ceremony .
they asked merkel to press wen to engage in full talks with the dalai lama .
relations between germany and china have improved since a spat in 2007 when merkel met the dalai lama , the exiled spiritual leader of tibet , at her office in berlin .
that meeting prompted beijing to suspend a " dialogue " with germany on the rule of law which only recently resumed .
the mood at thursday 's meeting was conciliatory .
the chinese premier said of his visit to the german capital , scheduled to last less than 20 hours , that the leaders " exchanged opinions in an open and honest atmosphere . "
wen described the thaw in relations saying , " after a cold winter , spring brings with it a relationship we can be proud of . "
improved economic relations wen told journalists there had been broad agreement in his talks with merkel and her ministers which dealt with the global economic slump and financial crisis . the two leaders said they agreed that protectionism must not be the answer to national economic troubles and pledged closer coordination on economic , trade , monetary and finance policy . the two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding on climate protection with greater cooperation on energy , research and technology . " my visit to germany puts me in a good mood , " wen told reporters . one of the technologies which china agreed to buy thursday was the german design work for the transrapid , a magnetic-levitation railway system which already operates in shanghai and which china aims to expand . " beijing wants to work with europe " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each year sees tons of chinese goods arriving in the eu germany is the second stage of a european tour that took wen to switzerland and the world economic forum in davos .
this week , wen is also scheduled to visit spain and britain . on friday , he will head a high-level chinese delegation to brussels to meet european commission president jose manuel barroso and other eu commissioners in a bid to heal strained political ties with the 27-nation bloc .
earlier this week , wen said beijing is ready to work together with europe to restore confidence in the faltering global financial system .
both china and the eu are heavily reliant on each other for trade , business and investment .
the eu is china 's largest trading partner , whereas china is the eu 's second-largest after the united states . dw staff -lrb- sp , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is now suing macedonia for the part it played in his abduction . a german citizen of lebanese descent is suing the eastern european nation of macedonia for 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,000 -rrb- in damages after being abducted there by the cia and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges , his lawyer said monday , jan .
26 .
according to his lawyer , khaled el-masri was arrested by the american intelligence agency in skopje in december , 2003 and held in a hotel near the american embassy for three weeks before being flown on one of the cia 's infamous rendition flights to afghanistan and tortured .
this is just the latest in a succession of lawsuits by el-masri , who has tried suing both the united states and spain .
the us supreme court upheld a decision to reject his case on national security grounds in 2007 .
masri , who worked as a car salesman , was traveling to macedonia in late december 2003 to celebrate the new year .
he was held in a hotel near the us embassy in the capital skopje and questioned .
he was asked in english , a language he does not speak well , about ties to al qaeda and islamic extremists .
the lawsuit said macedonia violated provisions of the european convention on human rights , including on torture , liberty and respect for human rights .
traumatic experience el-masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , told the afp news agency that his client was beaten and bullied for five months without explanation in afghanistan before being freed in albania .
gnjidic has argued that the detention and interrogation of his client by the cia left him traumatized and his mental distress led to him setting fire to a supermarket in germany in 2007 .
" he is undergoing therapy because still nowadays he can not get his psyche under control , " said gnjidic .
" he does n't know who is responsible for what happened to him . "
the cia rendition flights took suspected terrorists captured in one country to another or a us-run detention center for questioning and , as many allege , torture .

nancy pelosi 's smiles were n't shared by republicans democrats cheered .
but republicans remained silent - not one had voted in favour of the bill .
you can only wonder what was the reaction in the white house .
perhaps there was relief that a new president had overcome his first major hurdle in congress , but surely also frustration that barack obama 's charm offensive had counted for little .
his efforts to win round republicans in a series of conciliatory face-to-face meetings had ultimately proved futile .
his hopes and claims of an end to bitter bipartisan division - a new political spring - has been hit by the cold , harsh realities of business as usual on capitol hill .
once bitten , twice shy asking americans to stump up another $ 800bn , on top of the $ 700bn already requested by president bush , was always going to be a hard sell .
the president had gone to talk directly to house republicans this was particularly the case for republicans who feel like they are selling their soul and ditching their principles by allowing the state to rescue the world 's most powerful free market economy .
it was n't just the astronomic price tag .
it was the bill 's focus on government intervention .
many republicans still feel a sense of shame in backing the earlier bailout for the banks .
now it 's a case of once bitten , twice shy .
barack obama had worked hard , even before he entered the white house , to try to overcome their obvious concerns .
he hoped republicans ' natural scepticism could be erased by the promise of tax cuts : $ 275bn will go towards easing the tax burden on low and middle income earners .
but there is still the $ 40bn to be spent on improving america 's crumbling infrastructure , the $ 41bn for education , tens of billions more for health care and energy efficiency .
more eyebrows were raised with the inclusion of $ 300m to combat sexually transmitted diseases and $ 50m for the arts .
democrats had the sense to drop requests to spend millions on tarting up washington 's mall .
still listening but republicans still balked with dismissive words like " welfare state " and " government waste " .
and it is not just a matter of ideology , or party petulance .
many still wonder whether the stimulus will actually work .
why get their hands dirty , when they wo n't even get any of the credit if the grand plan does succeed in creating 3m plus jobs ?
it 's still a huge gamble .
what we ca n't do is to drag our feet or allow the same partisan differences to get in our way barack obama in one sense it does n't matter that the republicans unanimously rejected the bill - barack obama is still on course to get the backing of the senate .
but by opposing the bill the republicans are making clear to the country that this is not their plan .
it is owned by the democrats and the president alone .
barack obama has not given up on his hopes of ending the " bitter bi-partisanship " of the bush era .
he is still promising more transparency than ever before with " every american able to go to the website recovery.gov to see how and where the money is being spent " .
despite the republican opposition he thanked the house , reiterated the importance of passing the bill and promised to continue listening .
" what we ca n't do " he said " is to drag our feet or allow the same partisan differences to get in our way . "
but after tonight his promises of a new political era , a spirit of " we 're all in this together " , may sound a little hollow .

he hoped republicans ' natural scepticism could be erased by the promise of tax cuts : $ 275bn will go towards easing the tax burden on low and middle income earners .
but there is still the $ 40bn to be spent on improving america 's crumbling infrastructure , the $ 41bn for education , tens of billions more for health care and energy efficiency .
more eyebrows were raised with the inclusion of $ 300m to combat sexually transmitted diseases and $ 50m for the arts .
democrats had the sense to drop requests to spend millions on tarting up washington 's mall .
still listening but republicans still balked with dismissive words like " welfare state " and " government waste " .
and it is not just a matter of ideology , or party petulance .
many still wonder whether the stimulus will actually work .
why get their hands dirty , when they wo n't even get any of the credit if the grand plan does succeed in creating 3m plus jobs ?
it 's still a huge gamble .
what we ca n't do is to drag our feet or allow the same partisan differences to get in our way barack obama in one sense it does n't matter that the republicans unanimously rejected the bill - barack obama is still on course to get the backing of the senate .
but by opposing the bill the republicans are making clear to the country that this is not their plan .
it is owned by the democrats and the president alone .
barack obama has not given up on his hopes of ending the " bitter bi-partisanship " of the bush era .
he is still promising more transparency than ever before with " every american able to go to the website recovery.gov to see how and where the money is being spent " .
despite the republican opposition he thanked the house , reiterated the importance of passing the bill and promised to continue listening .
" what we ca n't do " he said " is to drag our feet or allow the same partisan differences to get in our way . "
but after tonight his promises of a new political era , a spirit of " we 're all in this together " , may sound a little hollow .

sixteen-month-old joshua clark , from caernarfon , gwynedd , was born with optic nerve hypoplasia and his parents were told no treatment was available .
joanna and anthony clark found the chinese therapy after doing research via the internet .
an auction to help fund the £ 40,000 op was held on thursday and raised £ 8,160 .
joshua 's grandfather dr kevin doughty said his wife , gill , a nurse who worked on an eye ward , first noticed when joshua was three months old that his eyes did not react in the way she expected .
" it was a slow job to get the medics involved .
it took a long time to get the tests that showed what he had , " dr doughty told the bbc wales news website .
when joshua was six months , he was finally given a diagnosis .
his father anthony said : " they explained the situation and said there was nothing they could do for us .
optic nerve hypoplasia onh is a congenital condition caused by underdevelopment of the optic nerve it can cause anything from mild light sensitivity to total blindness can be part of a disorder known as septo-optic dysplasia " we were n't very happy with that , and about a week later we started looking it up on the internet .
we were talking to people in america particularly , people who had had the treatment but also medics who knew about it . "
they launched a fundraising campaign to enable joshua to undergo treatment at hangzhou , near shanghai , and have so far raised £ 24,500 towards the £ 40,000 needed .
the family will fly to china at the end of april and will spend five weeks accompanied by various relatives at different times while joshua undergoes treatment with umbilical cord stem cells .
when he returns he will need daily treatment for a year in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber which has been installed at the family 's home in order to maximise the effect of the therapy .
the family is not hoping for miracles .
they know joshua is unlikely to have normal vision , but they hope he will be able to detect light , differentiate between night and day and see colours and objects .
mr clark said : " we 're hoping that he can see something , light and shapes and some distance in front of him .
" we 're just hoping that we may get something from it .
it may not work , and it 's hard to take so you do n't want to go out with too many expectations . "
' stronger relationship ' he believes the family has been drawn more closely together as a result of their experiences .
" i think it 's made myself and joanna 's relationship stronger , " he said .
the auction , organised by neighbours of the clarks , is being held at the celtic royal hotel in caernarfon on thursday night .
no-one from the uk is believed to have undergone stem cell therapy for onh in china but two girls from northern ireland are due to go prior to joshua .
glamour model jordan 's son harvey was born with the condition .

advertisement joshua will have five weeks ' treatment in china with umbilical cord stem cells the family of a toddler who was born blind are hoping a course of cutting-edge stem cell therapy in china could let some light into his life .

when joshua was six months , he was finally given a diagnosis .
his father anthony said : " they explained the situation and said there was nothing they could do for us .
optic nerve hypoplasia onh is a congenital condition caused by underdevelopment of the optic nerve it can cause anything from mild light sensitivity to total blindness can be part of a disorder known as septo-optic dysplasia " we were n't very happy with that , and about a week later we started looking it up on the internet .

they launched a fundraising campaign to enable joshua to undergo treatment at hangzhou , near shanghai , and have so far raised £ 24,500 towards the £ 40,000 needed .
the family will fly to china at the end of april and will spend five weeks accompanied by various relatives at different times while joshua undergoes treatment with umbilical cord stem cells .

advertisement people in pontypridd give their views as multi-million pound plans for a shopping precint revamp are shelved an ambitious multi-million pound plan at the heart of efforts to transform a town centre has been put on hold .
the redevelopment of the run-down taff vale shopping precinct in pontypridd would have featured offices , shops , a hotel and apartments .
but the riverside scheme was not thought to be viable in the current economic climate .
instead , a new scaled-down plan , focused on retail , is being drafted for the precinct site .
andy crompton , of riddelltps limited , agents for developers taff vale limited , said : " there are very few , if any , developments of that size going on anywhere in the uk at the moment .
" it 's very difficult to secure funding in the current financial climate for a new development of this scale .
" we are working very hard in the background on an alternative scheme that we can deliver in the current climate based on the site we own . "
the taff vale shopping precinct has a major role to play in the regeneration of pontypridd rhonda cynon taf council taff vale shopping precinct has long been considered an eyesore by many residents and its redevelopment , originally put at more than £ 50m , is considered an important part of rejuvenating the town .
mr crompton said : " the existing site on which taff vale shopping centre sits is a key site in the regeneration of pontypridd town centre and as such we are committed to delivering a new scheme . "
a spokesperson for rhondda cynon taf council said : " the taff vale shopping precinct has a major role to play in the regeneration of pontypridd and we do have a vision for the site which has received wide support from the public .
" however , due to the economic recession experienced globally , we understand that our preferred developers are looking at other options in relation to this site . "
the precinct is considered an eyesore by many people in the town the council said it had been working hard to improve the town generally and was committed to making pontypridd " a major shopping destination for the future " .
" tangible successes , such as the opening of st catherine 's corner , traffic restrictions in taff street and the ongoing streetscape enhancements are just the beginning , " said the council .
gianni orsi , chairman of pontypridd chamber of trade , said he was disappointed about the decision but not surprised .
" given the current market situation , i 'm not surprised .
there was always talk about whether it was the right scheme for pontypridd , whether it was too ambitious , too big , " he said .
" i think a scaled-down scheme where we do n't rely on one massive retailer - that would be terrific . "
he said the original plan had involved residential flats but there was little demand for such properties at the moment .

the public accounts committee said in 2007 51,000 pupils left school without a gcse of at least d-g in maths and 39,000 left without this in english .
the report into adult literacy and numeracy also warned that only one in five offenders with poor basic skills had enrolled on a course to help them .
ministers said no other government had invested so much in basic skills .
the committee of mps said a lack of up-to-date information about skills meant the government could not be sure its schemes to improve basic skills were working . "
this is a dismal picture " edward leigh , pac chairman read your stories chairman of the pac edward leigh said anyone who believed the government could meet its target of 95 % adult literacy and numeracy by 2020 was " living in cloud cuckooland " .
" whilst they have made some progress , i do n't think there 's the remotest chance they will reach that , " he told the bbc .
even doing so would only bring england to the level currently achieved by the top 25 % of the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- countries , the pac added .
tackling poor literacy and numeracy skills was essential if more people were to realise their full potential and england was to remain competitive in the global economy , the report concluded .
the committee called for better efforts to recruit numeracy teachers and urged the government to do more to encourage public services , such as health and housing , to promote training opportunities .
the prison service could play a vital role in helping offenders , the committee said . "

" we 've got to accept there 's something wrong with our teaching . "
further education minister sion simon said no government had done more to further the nation 's literacy and numeracy skills .
" we have revolutionised the way in which basic skills are dealt with , and through the skills for life strategy , have helped more than 5.7 million adults to improve their numeracy and literacy skills .

we have committed a further £ 3.9bn to skills for life through to 2011 . "
he said that since 2001 , more than 2.8 million people had achieved skills for life qualifications .
a new survey of that scheme would be commissioned next year , he added .
barry sheerman , chairman of the commons ' schools select committee , criticised the pac report saying it was a " thin piece of work " , based on little evidence .
the labour mp said : " to make sweeping generalisations about adult literacy and numeracy does a disservice to everyone , learners and teachers across the country " .
the new survey was welcomed by professor greg brooks from sheffield university 's school of education .
professor brooks , who has conducted research into approaches to adult learning , said too little was known about what works to improve adult skills .
" we need to have more precisely focused investigation of the specific teaching methods which hold out the promise of better progress for learners , " he said .

' too little known ' " last year we launched a national high-profile numeracy ad campaign , ' get on ' , to increase demand , and we are recruiting more high quality numeracy teachers .
we have committed a further £ 3.9bn to skills for life through to 2011 . "
he said that since 2001 , more than 2.8 million people had achieved skills for life qualifications .
a new survey of that scheme would be commissioned next year , he added .
barry sheerman , chairman of the commons ' schools select committee , criticised the pac report saying it was a " thin piece of work " , based on little evidence .
the labour mp said : " to make sweeping generalisations about adult literacy and numeracy does a disservice to everyone , learners and teachers across the country " .
the new survey was welcomed by professor greg brooks from sheffield university 's school of education .
professor brooks , who has conducted research into approaches to adult learning , said too little was known about what works to improve adult skills .
" we need to have more precisely focused investigation of the specific teaching methods which hold out the promise of better progress for learners , " he said .

we have revolutionised the way in which basic skills are dealt with further education minister sion simon mr leigh said : " this is a dismal picture , both for the many who face diminished prospects in what they can achieve in life and for the competitiveness of our country in the world economy .
" it 's down to teaching .
as a country , we 've got to accept that since the 1960s we have performed woefully in international league tables .
" we 've got to accept there 's something wrong with our teaching . "
further education minister sion simon said no government had done more to further the nation 's literacy and numeracy skills .
" we have revolutionised the way in which basic skills are dealt with , and through the skills for life strategy , have helped more than 5.7 million adults to improve their numeracy and literacy skills .
' too little known ' " last year we launched a national high-profile numeracy ad campaign , ' get on ' , to increase demand , and we are recruiting more high quality numeracy teachers .
we have committed a further £ 3.9bn to skills for life through to 2011 . "
he said that since 2001 , more than 2.8 million people had achieved skills for life qualifications .
a new survey of that scheme would be commissioned next year , he added .
barry sheerman , chairman of the commons ' schools select committee , criticised the pac report saying it was a " thin piece of work " , based on little evidence .
the labour mp said : " to make sweeping generalisations about adult literacy and numeracy does a disservice to everyone , learners and teachers across the country " .
the new survey was welcomed by professor greg brooks from sheffield university 's school of education .
professor brooks , who has conducted research into approaches to adult learning , said too little was known about what works to improve adult skills .
" we need to have more precisely focused investigation of the specific teaching methods which hold out the promise of better progress for learners , " he said .

parts are rubble .
for those parts , much of the emphasis this week has been about how to get aid into the territory .
where , for example , do you raise the hundreds of millions , probably billions of dollars needed to rebuild it after the war ?
who handles it ?
where do you channel it ?
but in the meantime , how are the people of gaza going about rebuilding their homes and their businesses ?
the muezzin at the salaam mosque , east of jabalya , was not waiting .
you normally hear the call to prayer , when it has been tinnily amplified through a loudspeaker .
but for these midday prayers , the muezzin was only audible to those close by .
he had a beautiful voice , the notes held long , the quarter-tones gently wavering .
he stood , eyes closed , on the roof of his mosque , which was now just a couple of metres above the ground , on a pile of rubble .
prayers are now held on that large , jagged slab of concrete .
deep privations across the street , are the remains of the qadr family house .
it is now just an ugly heap of dust-strewn grey masonry , the only splash of colour a torn sheet and a cracked bathroom tile .
now , up a steep path to the top of the rubble , there is a corrugated iron shack .
it is a few metres square , with sheets for walls .
" my family - my children , my grandchildren and my brothers ' family - we number 80 , " the head of the family , qadr mohammed qadr told me .
he is a tall , 70-year-old man , sitting next to the small iron shack .
" now , 20 of us sleep here , each night . "
his home was , he said , destroyed on 14 january .
he returned as soon as the israeli troops withdrew .
the muezzin 's call to prayer does not travel far the privations are deep , he said , his citrus orchards have been destroyed , but he needed to return , because " this is my land . "
he had to be where four members of his family had died .
mr qadr received a daily supply of water .
and the un provides a one-off payment of about $ 150 for a family which has been made homeless .
but complete rebuilding - that will take years .
the un relief agency said that it is years behind schedule on previous reconstruction projects , because of israeli border closures .
and it is not just houses that need to be rebuilt .
fights for gas a further short walk across the churned land , is a filling station for propane gas canisters .
it used to be enclosed .
now it has one-and-a-half walls .
the pipeline was destroyed .
a pump has been punched with heavy machine gun fire .
it is a place that thousands of families rely on for their cooking gas .
as we arrived , fights were breaking out .
after an early morning bomb explosion , in which an israeli soldier had died , the israeli authorities had closed the border crossing points .
the gas supply had run out .
customers vent their fury at the owner - a man so tired and fed up that he did not want to give us his name , and who at one point told the assembled disgruntled customers that it would have been better if the israelis had completed the job and laid waste to the entire area .
prayers are held near the ruins of the mosque the owner and his workers had only just finished repairing the station so that it was operational .
one of the workers , 29-year-old mohammed jarada , watched the melees from what little shade the station forecourt now provided .
mr jarada said he was the only breadwinner for his own family of 12 , and despite being an employee at the gas station , his family were cooking on firewood .
the israeli authorities said that they had closed the crossing points because of the attack on their soldiers .
who did he blame ?
mohammed 's eyes fixed on the middle distance : " in this state of chaos , in this state of anarchy , " he said , " i ca n't blame anybody .
everyone is blaming everybody else in the gaza strip . "
the customers drifted off , without their canisters .
around them , the sound of reconstruction continued , the jarring pound of metal posts being hammered into the ground , the rhythmic scrape of mortar being smeared over breeze blocks .
one of the two men building the wall shone a rueful smile in our direction .
" until the next time , " he said .
there is a resilience and a resignation about people in gaza .
yes , the rebuilding has begun .
until , that is , the next cataclysm hits .

his home was , he said , destroyed on 14 january .

the muezzin 's call to prayer does not travel far the privations are deep , he said , his citrus orchards have been destroyed , but he needed to return , because " this is my land . "

mr qadr received a daily supply of water .
and the un provides a one-off payment of about $ 150 for a family which has been made homeless .

the un relief agency said that it is years behind schedule on previous reconstruction projects , because of israeli border closures .

prayers are held near the ruins of the mosque the owner and his workers had only just finished repairing the station so that it was operational .
one of the workers , 29-year-old mohammed jarada , watched the melees from what little shade the station forecourt now provided .
mr jarada said he was the only breadwinner for his own family of 12 , and despite being an employee at the gas station , his family were cooking on firewood .
the israeli authorities said that they had closed the crossing points because of the attack on their soldiers .

in september 2006 the catholic high school in rhyl , denbighshire , was placed in special measures by schools inspectorate estyn , which said it was failing to provide an acceptable standard of education .
by 2008 , however , it was taken out of those measures , and now aspires to be a " flagship " faith school .
in june 2007 , catherine britton was made acting head , and she was appointed permanently in june 2008 , as the school improved .
she admits : " it was a steep learning curve for me , but i was looking with fresh eyes so i could see things people had lived with for a long time and did n't really recognise as being in need of change .
" a head is nothing without a good team .
they are terrific teachers here . "
we do n't have rules , we have respect , behaviour and uniform ... we respect the teachers more and they respect us back sara magill , pupil the head spearheaded a " blitz on bad behaviour from day one " and launched an anti-bullying campaign .
a new uniform was introduced to increase self esteem and because " they all looked a bit scruffy and a bit down-at-heel somehow , even though they were n't " .
the reason for banning the school 's nickname was obvious : " well , how can you call a man like that ted ? "
mobile phones are banned and all children and staff wear badges displaying blessed edward 's crest .
achievements are praised and the head had a stamp made bearing the words " mrs britton says well done " .
traditional " rules " have been abolished and replaced with " expectations " .
" rules are there to be broken , " says mrs britton .
" it 's a matter of getting the children to accept responsibility for what they have done rather than imposing the responsibility which may be arbitrary . "
university entrants she focused on teachers as well as pupils .
teachers are encouraged to enhance their learning and development , and a focus group promotes ideas-sharing .
boards were erected in classrooms so pupils , teachers and parents can monitor progress and targets .
the improvements are obvious , says mrs britton , as the 2007 pass rate of 21 % at gcse a-star to c grade rose last year to 53 % .
she expects a similar increase this year .
she is proud the school is producing a generation of university entrants for the first time in their families , and enrolment has increased .
you do n't always need to wag your finger in a child 's face catherine britton , head teacher " children are transferring here from other schools at a rate of knots .
they are coming in their droves .
" at about this time of year we normally have 30 to 35 firm applicants for next september , but this year already we have got 117 .
it 's absolutely wonderful . "
named after a 16th century priest who was tortured and executed in 1590 before being beatified in 1929 , blessed edward jones is a catholic school , but " all faiths are welcome " .
morning prayers are held in the chapel - which doubles as a " quiet , relaxing space " for unruly pupils to lie belly-down on a pillow and " reflect on what you did " .
" you do n't always need to wag your finger in a child 's face , " says mrs britton .
" we treat them with dignity .
we have absolutely followed the example of blessed edward , who was a man of forgiveness . "
year 11 pupils - who were , refreshingly , not hand-picked by the head - would appear to back that up .
amy hughes , 15 , said : " i 've been here since year 7 and it 's a better school now , everyone is better behaved . "
sara magill , 16 , said : " we do n't have rules , we have respect , behaviour and uniform .
we respect the teachers more and they respect us back .
" i reckon it 's down to her -lsb- mrs britton -rsb- .
she treats us like adults . "
year 11 pupils agree that their school has undergone improvement gabrielle ambrose , 15 , adds : " i came to the school in september and was n't here when everything changed .
" but i knew people who were pupils here and when the uniform was introduced , everyone was walking two feet taller . "
michael trickett , 15 , said : " the paint in the cloakroom is n't the best , so myself and some others are going to re-do it in our own time .
it 's to give something back to the school . "
alex beattie , 15 , said : " we respect the school more , whereas in year 7 we 'd just throw rubbish on the floor . "
christian pimley , 16 , adds : " children of our age just had a laugh about being in special measures .
it 's a much better atmosphere now .
the school 's got more of a buzz . "
there are no set rules to improving failing schools , but mrs britton has offered " any assistance " to colleagues who want advice .
that offer may prove tempting for nearby rhyl high school , which was placed in special measures last week .
but for now , mrs britton will focus on another fight .
rhyl high is the latest denbighshire school in special measures education minister jane hutt intends to approve plans to close sixth forms at blessed edward jones and rhyl high , creating a new college operated in conjunction with llandrillo college .
a report recently discussed by denbighshire council suggested the school was in financial deficit and unless " more radical " action was taken , it was unlikely to provide a balanced budget by 2010 .
the council rejected a financial recovery plan from the school because it said it was not robust enough .
however , mrs britton says the school has a revised plan which she believes will be accepted .
she claims the decision to close blessed edward 's sixth form was partly based on a previous report which judged that results were not good enough .
she said : " this school has had a major turnaround since that report was written 18 months ago .
the results had not been good enough and now they are . "
she says the school could quadruple its existing number of 35 sixth form students , which would massively improve its financial situation through funding .
while not opposed to working with the new college , she has vowed to move " heaven and earth " to avoid closure .
she said : " i will find a way , one way or another , of preserving a faith dimension to post-16 learning in denbighshire . "

in september 2006 the catholic high school in rhyl , denbighshire , was placed in special measures by schools inspectorate estyn , which said it was failing to provide an acceptable standard of education .
by 2008 , however , it was taken out of those measures , and now aspires to be a " flagship " faith school .
in june 2007 , catherine britton was made acting head , and she was appointed permanently in june 2008 , as the school improved .
she admits : " it was a steep learning curve for me , but i was looking with fresh eyes so i could see things people had lived with for a long time and did n't really recognise as being in need of change .
" a head is nothing without a good team .
they are terrific teachers here . "
we do n't have rules , we have respect , behaviour and uniform ... we respect the teachers more and they respect us back sara magill , pupil the head spearheaded a " blitz on bad behaviour from day one " and launched an anti-bullying campaign .
a new uniform was introduced to increase self esteem and because " they all looked a bit scruffy and a bit down-at-heel somehow , even though they were n't " .
the reason for banning the school 's nickname was obvious : " well , how can you call a man like that ted ? "
mobile phones are banned and all children and staff wear badges displaying blessed edward 's crest .
achievements are praised and the head had a stamp made bearing the words " mrs britton says well done " .
traditional " rules " have been abolished and replaced with " expectations " .
" rules are there to be broken , " says mrs britton .
" it 's a matter of getting the children to accept responsibility for what they have done rather than imposing the responsibility which may be arbitrary . "
university entrants she focused on teachers as well as pupils .
teachers are encouraged to enhance their learning and development , and a focus group promotes ideas-sharing .
boards were erected in classrooms so pupils , teachers and parents can monitor progress and targets .
the improvements are obvious , says mrs britton , as the 2007 pass rate of 21 % at gcse a-star to c grade rose last year to 53 % .
she expects a similar increase this year .
she is proud the school is producing a generation of university entrants for the first time in their families , and enrolment has increased .
you do n't always need to wag your finger in a child 's face catherine britton , head teacher " children are transferring here from other schools at a rate of knots .
they are coming in their droves .
" at about this time of year we normally have 30 to 35 firm applicants for next september , but this year already we have got 117 .
it 's absolutely wonderful . "
named after a 16th century priest who was tortured and executed in 1590 before being beatified in 1929 , blessed edward jones is a catholic school , but " all faiths are welcome " .
morning prayers are held in the chapel - which doubles as a " quiet , relaxing space " for unruly pupils to lie belly-down on a pillow and " reflect on what you did " .
" you do n't always need to wag your finger in a child 's face , " says mrs britton .
" we treat them with dignity .
we have absolutely followed the example of blessed edward , who was a man of forgiveness . "
year 11 pupils - who were , refreshingly , not hand-picked by the head - would appear to back that up .
amy hughes , 15 , said : " i 've been here since year 7 and it 's a better school now , everyone is better behaved . "
sara magill , 16 , said : " we do n't have rules , we have respect , behaviour and uniform .
we respect the teachers more and they respect us back .
" i reckon it 's down to her -lsb- mrs britton -rsb- .
she treats us like adults . "
year 11 pupils agree that their school has undergone improvement gabrielle ambrose , 15 , adds : " i came to the school in september and was n't here when everything changed .
" but i knew people who were pupils here and when the uniform was introduced , everyone was walking two feet taller . "
michael trickett , 15 , said : " the paint in the cloakroom is n't the best , so myself and some others are going to re-do it in our own time .
it 's to give something back to the school . "
alex beattie , 15 , said : " we respect the school more , whereas in year 7 we 'd just throw rubbish on the floor . "
christian pimley , 16 , adds : " children of our age just had a laugh about being in special measures .
it 's a much better atmosphere now .
the school 's got more of a buzz . "
there are no set rules to improving failing schools , but mrs britton has offered " any assistance " to colleagues who want advice .
that offer may prove tempting for nearby rhyl high school , which was placed in special measures last week .
but for now , mrs britton will focus on another fight .
rhyl high is the latest denbighshire school in special measures education minister jane hutt intends to approve plans to close sixth forms at blessed edward jones and rhyl high , creating a new college operated in conjunction with llandrillo college .
a report recently discussed by denbighshire council suggested the school was in financial deficit and unless " more radical " action was taken , it was unlikely to provide a balanced budget by 2010 .
the council rejected a financial recovery plan from the school because it said it was not robust enough .
however , mrs britton says the school has a revised plan which she believes will be accepted .
she claims the decision to close blessed edward 's sixth form was partly based on a previous report which judged that results were not good enough .
she said : " this school has had a major turnaround since that report was written 18 months ago .
the results had not been good enough and now they are . "
she says the school could quadruple its existing number of 35 sixth form students , which would massively improve its financial situation through funding .
while not opposed to working with the new college , she has vowed to move " heaven and earth " to avoid closure .
she said : " i will find a way , one way or another , of preserving a faith dimension to post-16 learning in denbighshire . "

she is proud the school is producing a generation of university entrants for the first time in their families , and enrolment has increased . "
you do n't always need to wag your finger in a child 's face " catherine britton , head teacher " children are transferring here from other schools at a rate of knots .
they are coming in their droves .
" at about this time of year we normally have 30 to 35 firm applicants for next september , but this year already we have got 117 .
it 's absolutely wonderful . "
named after a 16th century priest who was tortured and executed in 1590 before being beatified in 1929 , blessed edward jones is a catholic school , but " all faiths are welcome " .
morning prayers are held in the chapel - which doubles as a " quiet , relaxing space " for unruly pupils to lie belly-down on a pillow and " reflect on what you did " .
" you do n't always need to wag your finger in a child 's face , " says mrs britton .
" we treat them with dignity .
we have absolutely followed the example of blessed edward , who was a man of forgiveness . "
year 11 pupils - who were , refreshingly , not hand-picked by the head - would appear to back that up .
amy hughes , 15 , said : " i 've been here since year 7 and it 's a better school now , everyone is better behaved . "
sara magill , 16 , said : " we do n't have rules , we have respect , behaviour and uniform .
we respect the teachers more and they respect us back .
" i reckon it 's down to her -lsb- mrs britton -rsb- .
she treats us like adults . "
gabrielle ambrose , 15 , adds : " i came to the school in september and was n't here when everything changed .
" but i knew people who were pupils here and when the uniform was introduced , everyone was walking two feet taller . "
michael trickett , 15 , said : " the paint in the cloakroom is n't the best , so myself and some others are going to re-do it in our own time .
it 's to give something back to the school . "
alex beattie , 15 , said : " we respect the school more , whereas in year 7 we 'd just throw rubbish on the floor . "
christian pimley , 16 , adds : " children of our age just had a laugh about being in special measures .
it 's a much better atmosphere now .
the school 's got more of a buzz . "
there are no set rules to improving failing schools , but mrs britton has offered " any assistance " to colleagues who want advice .
that offer may prove tempting for nearby rhyl high school , which was placed in special measures last week .
but for now , mrs britton will focus on another fight .
education minister jane hutt intends to approve plans to close sixth forms at blessed edward jones and rhyl high , creating a new college operated in conjunction with llandrillo college .
a report recently discussed by denbighshire council suggested the school was in financial deficit and unless " more radical " action was taken , it was unlikely to provide a balanced budget by 2010 .
the council rejected a financial recovery plan from the school because it said it was not robust enough .
however , mrs britton says the school has a revised plan which she believes will be accepted .
she claims the decision to close blessed edward 's sixth form was partly based on a previous report which judged that results were not good enough .
she said : " this school has had a major turnaround since that report was written 18 months ago .
the results had not been good enough and now they are . "
she says the school could quadruple its existing number of 35 sixth form students , which would massively improve its financial situation through funding .
while not opposed to working with the new college , she has vowed to move " heaven and earth " to avoid closure .
she said : " i will find a way , one way or another , of preserving a faith dimension to post-16 learning in denbighshire . "

around 39 % of shops in holyhead on anglesey will be empty by the start of february , according to the credit reference company experian .
this is four times the uk average .
wena alun owen was taken on a tour by the mayor of a town where the closure of woolworths at the end of december was seen as the last straw .
the chat in the internet cafe is lively , hope for the future and remembering the past .
holyhead 's mayor was taking me around the credit-crunch hit town , reminiscing about the shops of her youth .
with her was the honorary secretary of the local maritime museum , with whom she has been a friend since childhood .
the experian survey found the anglesey town will have the joint highest shop vacancies - with milford haven , pembrokeshire - by next month .
but the town 's message was defiant .
" yes , there are problems here , but it 's no different to other towns , and some things are even improving , " said ailia lewis , 68 .
the mayor , ailia lewis mbe , has been a lollipop lady for 30 years her friend , john cave , 74 , said it was unfair when the town was singled out as particularly depressed .
mrs lewis , the mayor , has been a councillor for 20 years and a school lollipop lady for 30 .
she 's been awarded an mbe for her community work .
" there is a shadow hanging over the town because of what is happening at anglesey aluminium -lsb- jobs could go when the wylfa nuclear power station closes in 2010 as the plant relies on cheap electricity from the plant -rsb- , " she said .
" if they stay , and please god they do , then it will give us a bit of a boost , " she added .
mr cave , also an mbe , would like to see more bistros and restaurants open .
both lament the closure of woolworths .
" it was so exciting when it opened in the early 50s because before then we 'd go to woollies in chester , and later in bangor , " he said .
the once disputed celtic gateway bridge which links the railway station and ferry port to the town centre is now much accepted , and well used .
i 'm hoping that things will pick up in the summer , especially as they 're saying that more people will holiday in the uk , and i 'm going to try evening opening sandra stewart , internet cafe , holyhead " there is a good community here , there are good football teams here for instance , " said the mayor .
" holyhead hotspurs get 300 watching them on a saturday and there 's talk of a link between them a team in dun laoghaire to make the most of the welsh / ireland link , " said mrs lewis .

around 39 % of shops in holyhead on anglesey will be empty by the start of february , according to the credit reference company experian .
this is four times the uk average .
wena alun owen was taken on a tour by the mayor of a town where the closure of woolworths at the end of december was seen as the last straw .
the chat in the internet cafe is lively , hope for the future and remembering the past .
holyhead 's mayor was taking me around the credit-crunch hit town , reminiscing about the shops of her youth .
with her was the honorary secretary of the local maritime museum , with whom she has been a friend since childhood .
the experian survey found the anglesey town will have the joint highest shop vacancies - with milford haven , pembrokeshire - by next month .
but the town 's message was defiant .
" yes , there are problems here , but it 's no different to other towns , and some things are even improving , " said ailia lewis , 68 .

" if they stay , and please god they do , then it will give us a bit of a boost , " she added .
mr cave , also an mbe , would like to see more bistros and restaurants open .
both lament the closure of woolworths .
" it was so exciting when it opened in the early 50s because before then we 'd go to woollies in chester , and later in bangor , " he said .

adrian desmond , with co-author james moore , argue in a new book that the great scientist had a " sacred cause " : the abolition of slavery .
a powerful symbol -lrb- courtesy of the trustees of the wedgwood museum -rrb- " it makes one 's blood boil , " said charles darwin .
not much outraged the gentle recluse , but the horrors of slavery could cost him a night 's sleep .
he was thinking of the whipped house boy and the thumbscrews used by old ladies in south america , atrocities he had witnessed on the beagle voyage .
the screams stayed with him for life , but how much did they influence his life 's work ?
today you can still read of darwin 's " eureka " moment when he saw the galapagos finches .
alas , his conversion to evolution was n't so simple , but it was much more interesting .
it did n't occur in the galapagos , but probably on his arrival home .
and new evidence suggests that darwin 's unique approach to evolution - relating all races and species by " common descent " - could have been fostered by his anti-slavery beliefs .
family feelings after circumnavigating the globe -lrb- 1831-6 -rrb- , darwin settled in london .
here in 1838 he formulated his theory of " natural selection " , after which he became increasingly reclusive , particularly following his move to down village in kent .
he refrained from publishing a word on evolution until 1858 - not even a brief , priority-grabbing paper , as was his way with other projects .
his hesitance is understandable .
evolution was execrable to his cambridge friends .
bbc 's darwin season the genius of evolution please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
one naturalist called it " abominable trash vomited " out by revolutionaries ; and radicals did , indeed , deploy a self-sustaining evolution to undermine the creationist miracles on which anglican power rested .
darwin 's gouty cambridge professor , adam sedgwick , used " contempt , scorn , and ridicule " to trash one " filthy " evolution book in 1844 .
darwin , sensitive about his reputation , wisely laid low .
so why devise such a beastly theory in the first place , if it threatened ignominy ?
was there some integral moral gain ?
consider another question .
why was darwin 's evolution uniquely defined by common descent , the joining of races and species through shared ancestry ?
darwin 's common descent image is so obvious today that we forget to question where it came from .
' man and brother ' common descent in darwin 's younger day was ubiquitous in anti-slavery tracts .
consider the words of the famous cameo , depicting a kneeling slave asking " am i not a man and a brother ? "
that cameo was in fact the brainchild of the pottery-dynasty founder , josiah wedgwood , darwin 's grandfather .
new evidence shows how indebted darwin was to this anti-slavery heritage .
darwin knew that going into print would have invited derision darwin 's uncle jos wedgwood sold the firm 's london showroom , and ploughed the proceeds into an anti-slavery society , and in the 1850s -lrb- with american slavery still flourishing -rrb- the wedgwoods continued using labels showing the slave under britannia 's banner , which read " god hath made of one blood all nations of men " .
the anti-slavery agitator thomas clarkson - the man who rode 35,000 miles collecting statistics in the sea ports on the evil trade - was another bankrolled by josiah wedgwood .
with a wedgwood wife and mother , darwin saw abolition as a " sacred cause " too , and in his culminating work , the descent of man -lrb- 1871 -rrb- , he placed clarkson at the moral apex of humanity and called slavery a " great sin " .
such family feelings explain why , as a 16-year-old at edinburgh university in 1826 -lrb- in a period often dismissed by historians -rrb- , darwin could spend 40 extra-curricular hours with a freed slave from guyana studying taxidermy and become his " intimate " friend .
and this when many visiting americans saw any black / white friendship as " revolting " .
torture accounts darwin witnessed slavery everywhere in south america .
the beagle 's own supply ship on her previous trip had originally been a slaver , and , once sold , it reverted to slaving .
while darwin was on the continent , it was again disgorging chained africans .
darwin 's journal of the voyage -lrb- 1845 -rrb- gives a damning account of the tortures he saw or heard of ; but of all the " heart-sickening atrocities " , the worst for him were the stories of masters threatening to sell the children of disobedient slaves .
darwin was appalled at the treatment handed out to slaves as an outsider , he was " powerless as a child even to remonstrate " .
but within weeks of the beagle 's return , he developed a science which undercut the slave-master 's notions .
many plantation owners considered slaves a separate species , an animal to be exploited as such .
blacks and whites shared no joint ancestry .
yet the darwin-wedgwood maxim made the slave a " man and a brother " .
darwin opened his first evolution notebook in 1837 , damned slave-holders for their separate species view , then pushed common parentage to the zoological limit .
since species were only extended races , they too must share an ancestry .
he moved from talking of the common " father " of mankind to an " opossum " -like fossil as the father of all mammals .
human genealogy became the model for his famous " tree of life " .
fossil evidence none of this minimizes the importance of darwin 's galapagos and pampas observations .
the giant tortoises , mockingbirds and finches varied from island to island , and this became clearer to darwin after london zoo 's bird expert john gould analysed his finches in january 1837 .
then richard owen -lrb- the man shortly to give the world the " dinosaurs " -rrb- diagnosed darwin 's fossils .
darwin thought that some were " rhinos " -lrb- old world mammals -rrb- , yet owen showed that they were indigenous giant armadillos , sloths and anteaters .
so extinct animals were being succeeded by related living types .
this evidence remains crucial , but it was the way darwin marshalled it that concerns us .
assuming the tacit truth of racial " brotherhood " allowed him to join the bloodlines into a common descent configuration .
and he did so in 1837-8 , just as the west indies slaves were being released -lrb- technically freed in 1833 , they were forced to serve an " apprenticeship " which effectively kept them in bondage till 1838 -rrb- .
this freedom filled darwin with a sense of pride and he declared that " we ... have made a greater sacrifice , than ever made by any nation , to expiate our sin " .
he certainly had .
all too clear his common descent imagery was unknown elsewhere in natural history , beyond racially unifying works such as james cowles prichard 's researches into the physical history of mankind .
that book traced animal races to common ancestors in order to prove that all humans could have descended from adam .
darwin , preparing to write the origin of species , scribbled inside his copy of prichard : " how like my book all this will be " .
it was n't so .
he remained a worried man and in the later 1850s dropped humans from his publishing plans because the subject was " so surrounded with prejudices " .
but even though the origin of species -lrb- 1859 -rrb- skirted people , no one doubted that they remained at its core .
darwin 's " bulldog " t.h. huxley , who took over the fight for human evolution , said that when it came to uniting black and white ancestries , he " was pleased to be able to show that mr darwin was for once on the side of orthodoxy " .

one naturalist called it " abominable trash vomited " out by revolutionaries ; and radicals did , indeed , deploy a self-sustaining evolution to undermine the creationist miracles on which anglican power rested .
darwin 's gouty cambridge professor , adam sedgwick , used " contempt , scorn , and ridicule " to trash one " filthy " evolution book in 1844 .
darwin , sensitive about his reputation , wisely laid low .
so why devise such a beastly theory in the first place , if it threatened ignominy ?
was there some integral moral gain ?
consider another question .
why was darwin 's evolution uniquely defined by common descent , the joining of races and species through shared ancestry ?
darwin 's common descent image is so obvious today that we forget to question where it came from .
' man and brother ' common descent in darwin 's younger day was ubiquitous in anti-slavery tracts .
consider the words of the famous cameo , depicting a kneeling slave asking " am i not a man and a brother ? "
that cameo was in fact the brainchild of the pottery-dynasty founder , josiah wedgwood , darwin 's grandfather .
new evidence shows how indebted darwin was to this anti-slavery heritage .
darwin knew that going into print would have invited derision darwin 's uncle jos wedgwood sold the firm 's london showroom , and ploughed the proceeds into an anti-slavery society , and in the 1850s -lrb- with american slavery still flourishing -rrb- the wedgwoods continued using labels showing the slave under britannia 's banner , which read " god hath made of one blood all nations of men " .
the anti-slavery agitator thomas clarkson - the man who rode 35,000 miles collecting statistics in the sea ports on the evil trade - was another bankrolled by josiah wedgwood .
with a wedgwood wife and mother , darwin saw abolition as a " sacred cause " too , and in his culminating work , the descent of man -lrb- 1871 -rrb- , he placed clarkson at the moral apex of humanity and called slavery a " great sin " .
such family feelings explain why , as a 16-year-old at edinburgh university in 1826 -lrb- in a period often dismissed by historians -rrb- , darwin could spend 40 extra-curricular hours with a freed slave from guyana studying taxidermy and become his " intimate " friend .
and this when many visiting americans saw any black / white friendship as " revolting " .
torture accounts darwin witnessed slavery everywhere in south america .
the beagle 's own supply ship on her previous trip had originally been a slaver , and , once sold , it reverted to slaving .
while darwin was on the continent , it was again disgorging chained africans .
darwin 's journal of the voyage -lrb- 1845 -rrb- gives a damning account of the tortures he saw or heard of ; but of all the " heart-sickening atrocities " , the worst for him were the stories of masters threatening to sell the children of disobedient slaves .
darwin was appalled at the treatment handed out to slaves as an outsider , he was " powerless as a child even to remonstrate " .
but within weeks of the beagle 's return , he developed a science which undercut the slave-master 's notions .
many plantation owners considered slaves a separate species , an animal to be exploited as such .
blacks and whites shared no joint ancestry .
yet the darwin-wedgwood maxim made the slave a " man and a brother " .
darwin opened his first evolution notebook in 1837 , damned slave-holders for their separate species view , then pushed common parentage to the zoological limit .
since species were only extended races , they too must share an ancestry .
he moved from talking of the common " father " of mankind to an " opossum " -like fossil as the father of all mammals .
human genealogy became the model for his famous " tree of life " .
fossil evidence none of this minimizes the importance of darwin 's galapagos and pampas observations .
the giant tortoises , mockingbirds and finches varied from island to island , and this became clearer to darwin after london zoo 's bird expert john gould analysed his finches in january 1837 .
then richard owen -lrb- the man shortly to give the world the " dinosaurs " -rrb- diagnosed darwin 's fossils .
darwin thought that some were " rhinos " -lrb- old world mammals -rrb- , yet owen showed that they were indigenous giant armadillos , sloths and anteaters .
so extinct animals were being succeeded by related living types .
this evidence remains crucial , but it was the way darwin marshalled it that concerns us .
assuming the tacit truth of racial " brotherhood " allowed him to join the bloodlines into a common descent configuration .
and he did so in 1837-8 , just as the west indies slaves were being released -lrb- technically freed in 1833 , they were forced to serve an " apprenticeship " which effectively kept them in bondage till 1838 -rrb- .
this freedom filled darwin with a sense of pride and he declared that " we ... have made a greater sacrifice , than ever made by any nation , to expiate our sin " .
he certainly had .
all too clear his common descent imagery was unknown elsewhere in natural history , beyond racially unifying works such as james cowles prichard 's researches into the physical history of mankind .
that book traced animal races to common ancestors in order to prove that all humans could have descended from adam .
darwin , preparing to write the origin of species , scribbled inside his copy of prichard : " how like my book all this will be " .
it was n't so .
he remained a worried man and in the later 1850s dropped humans from his publishing plans because the subject was " so surrounded with prejudices " .
but even though the origin of species -lrb- 1859 -rrb- skirted people , no one doubted that they remained at its core .
darwin 's " bulldog " t.h. huxley , who took over the fight for human evolution , said that when it came to uniting black and white ancestries , he " was pleased to be able to show that mr darwin was for once on the side of orthodoxy " .

adrian desmond , with co-author james moore , argue in a new book that the great scientist had a " sacred cause " : the abolition of slavery .
a powerful symbol -lrb- courtesy of the trustees of the wedgwood museum -rrb- " it makes one 's blood boil , " said charles darwin .
not much outraged the gentle recluse , but the horrors of slavery could cost him a night 's sleep .
he was thinking of the whipped house boy and the thumbscrews used by old ladies in south america , atrocities he had witnessed on the beagle voyage .
the screams stayed with him for life , but how much did they influence his life 's work ?
today you can still read of darwin 's " eureka " moment when he saw the galapagos finches .
alas , his conversion to evolution was n't so simple , but it was much more interesting .
it did n't occur in the galapagos , but probably on his arrival home .
and new evidence suggests that darwin 's unique approach to evolution - relating all races and species by " common descent " - could have been fostered by his anti-slavery beliefs .
family feelings after circumnavigating the globe -lrb- 1831-6 -rrb- , darwin settled in london .
here in 1838 he formulated his theory of " natural selection " , after which he became increasingly reclusive , particularly following his move to down village in kent .
he refrained from publishing a word on evolution until 1858 - not even a brief , priority-grabbing paper , as was his way with other projects .
his hesitance is understandable .
evolution was execrable to his cambridge friends .
bbc 's darwin season the genius of evolution please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
one naturalist called it " abominable trash vomited " out by revolutionaries ; and radicals did , indeed , deploy a self-sustaining evolution to undermine the creationist miracles on which anglican power rested .
darwin 's gouty cambridge professor , adam sedgwick , used " contempt , scorn , and ridicule " to trash one " filthy " evolution book in 1844 .
darwin , sensitive about his reputation , wisely laid low .
so why devise such a beastly theory in the first place , if it threatened ignominy ?
was there some integral moral gain ?
consider another question .
why was darwin 's evolution uniquely defined by common descent , the joining of races and species through shared ancestry ?
darwin 's common descent image is so obvious today that we forget to question where it came from .
' man and brother ' common descent in darwin 's younger day was ubiquitous in anti-slavery tracts .
consider the words of the famous cameo , depicting a kneeling slave asking " am i not a man and a brother ? "
that cameo was in fact the brainchild of the pottery-dynasty founder , josiah wedgwood , darwin 's grandfather .
new evidence shows how indebted darwin was to this anti-slavery heritage .
darwin knew that going into print would have invited derision darwin 's uncle jos wedgwood sold the firm 's london showroom , and ploughed the proceeds into an anti-slavery society , and in the 1850s -lrb- with american slavery still flourishing -rrb- the wedgwoods continued using labels showing the slave under britannia 's banner , which read " god hath made of one blood all nations of men " .
the anti-slavery agitator thomas clarkson - the man who rode 35,000 miles collecting statistics in the sea ports on the evil trade - was another bankrolled by josiah wedgwood .
with a wedgwood wife and mother , darwin saw abolition as a " sacred cause " too , and in his culminating work , the descent of man -lrb- 1871 -rrb- , he placed clarkson at the moral apex of humanity and called slavery a " great sin " .
such family feelings explain why , as a 16-year-old at edinburgh university in 1826 -lrb- in a period often dismissed by historians -rrb- , darwin could spend 40 extra-curricular hours with a freed slave from guyana studying taxidermy and become his " intimate " friend .
and this when many visiting americans saw any black / white friendship as " revolting " .
torture accounts darwin witnessed slavery everywhere in south america .
the beagle 's own supply ship on her previous trip had originally been a slaver , and , once sold , it reverted to slaving .
while darwin was on the continent , it was again disgorging chained africans .
darwin 's journal of the voyage -lrb- 1845 -rrb- gives a damning account of the tortures he saw or heard of ; but of all the " heart-sickening atrocities " , the worst for him were the stories of masters threatening to sell the children of disobedient slaves .
darwin was appalled at the treatment handed out to slaves as an outsider , he was " powerless as a child even to remonstrate " .
but within weeks of the beagle 's return , he developed a science which undercut the slave-master 's notions .
many plantation owners considered slaves a separate species , an animal to be exploited as such .
blacks and whites shared no joint ancestry .
yet the darwin-wedgwood maxim made the slave a " man and a brother " .
darwin opened his first evolution notebook in 1837 , damned slave-holders for their separate species view , then pushed common parentage to the zoological limit .
since species were only extended races , they too must share an ancestry .
he moved from talking of the common " father " of mankind to an " opossum " -like fossil as the father of all mammals .
human genealogy became the model for his famous " tree of life " .
fossil evidence none of this minimizes the importance of darwin 's galapagos and pampas observations .
the giant tortoises , mockingbirds and finches varied from island to island , and this became clearer to darwin after london zoo 's bird expert john gould analysed his finches in january 1837 .
then richard owen -lrb- the man shortly to give the world the " dinosaurs " -rrb- diagnosed darwin 's fossils .
darwin thought that some were " rhinos " -lrb- old world mammals -rrb- , yet owen showed that they were indigenous giant armadillos , sloths and anteaters .
so extinct animals were being succeeded by related living types .
this evidence remains crucial , but it was the way darwin marshalled it that concerns us .
assuming the tacit truth of racial " brotherhood " allowed him to join the bloodlines into a common descent configuration .
and he did so in 1837-8 , just as the west indies slaves were being released -lrb- technically freed in 1833 , they were forced to serve an " apprenticeship " which effectively kept them in bondage till 1838 -rrb- .
this freedom filled darwin with a sense of pride and he declared that " we ... have made a greater sacrifice , than ever made by any nation , to expiate our sin " .
he certainly had .
